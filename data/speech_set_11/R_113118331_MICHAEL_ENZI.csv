1130012144,"I wish to thank the Senator from Alabama for all the work he has done on the budget. He worked on a budget for 2 years previous to this which never materialized. I am so pleased he and his staff are working on a budget. I understand his disappointment. I am an accountant. and I hope Senator JOHNSON. who is the other accountant in the Senate. will have an opportunity to come to the floor and talk about some of the numbers because there seems to be some discrepancies in the numbers. He has tried to pin those down by asking questions of the staff and. as a result. has come up with some demonstrations that show where the budget we are currently talking about goes. I wanted to just briefly share an article I ran across today. It is called ""Mr. Penny vs. a dragon: Hey kids. its the national debt!"" How are kids across America going to understand the debt? We are having a lot of problems understanding it in this body. Washingtons budget squabbles and financial fights are enough to tangle up anyones head. so one can only imagine how it might confuse children. So enter Mr. Penny and the Dragon of Domeville. Lets see. that would be the dome? Yes. This childrens book by Lucile McConnell seeks to raise awareness of fiscal irresponsibility and the national debt for those who are just out of diapers. The books hero. Mr. Penny. is introduced as ""quite an individual and not a follower."" and begins: Once upon a penny. in the Land of Us"" That would be U.S.in the little town of Meville. lived a little penny. In fact. a whole lot of little pennies were scattered all over the Land of Us. but our story is about one particular penny: Mr. Penny. He was a singular fellow. quite an individual and not a follower of the crowd. The antagonist. a dragona black dragonif this had been a western story. it would be the guy with the black hata dragon designed to represent a bloated Federal Government that will not stop growing and loves to eat currency. In fact. he developed a taste for charred bills . . . dollar bills. Within no time. the dragon had devoured $15 trillion You can tell the book is a little old. otherwise it would be $16.6 trillion. which is where we are nowand was always looking around for more to consume. Eventually. Mr. Penny scores a oneonone with the dragon and does his level best to convince the dragon just how reckless Federal waste can be. I dont think you know what effect you are having on the whole land of Us by eating the money that we send to Domeville .... Our schools are closing. our youngsters cant go to college. our oldsters cant get medical help. our businesses are failing because there is no money for loans. our roads and bridges are falling down. our towns and industries are not safe. our citizens do not have jobs. and we are running out of money. On the books Web site. McConnell describes herself as ""a tax/commercial transactions attorney"" practicing in Washington and New York and saysand this is very importantall funds from the bookall funds from the bookwill go toward paying down the national debt. In an authors note in the book. McConnell writes: Our beloved Country is in trouble . . . big trouble. This is the kind of trouble that cannot be solved unless we all pitch in and come to the aid of our country immediately. She adds: My hope is that after reading this book. young people are energized about the possibility of what we can accomplish together through cooperation and teamwork. So. Madam President. I had an amendment in the committee that would have taken care of some of those charred bills and converted them to metal coinsdollar coins. If we were to do that. it would probably save about $1 billion. That maybe doesnt sound like much around here. but $1 billion would be a good start and would put a little punctuation in this book. We are getting to the point where if we dont do something. we will not have money to spend. If interest rates go upand if people lose confidence in our economy. the interest rates will go upthe only thing we will be able to pay is interest. Doesnt that sound like somebody who has used their credit card too much and cant afford to pay the credit card down? Of course. we are not even worried about paying the credit card down. We are not even talking about doing that. We are not even talking about balancing the budget at this point. and we need to do that or maybe we need to pass out copies of ""Mr. Penny and the Dragon of Domeville."" I yield the floor."
1130015989,Madam President. I want to speak today about the series of votes that are going to be taking place this afternoon on gun rights. I wanted to start off by telling a little story and explain why there are some difficulties with some of those amendments that are here. I had a person in Cheyenne come to me and say: I advertised a gun I wanted to sell. The guy was from southern Colorado. so he had to drive about 300 miles. But he was former FBI and had a concealed carry permit. He was willing to drive up to Cheyenne and wanted to do it the right wayboth of them wanted to do it the right way. The person from Colorado was willing to pay the fee for doing a gun check. The person in Cheyenne arranged for a federally licensed dealer to do that. So they met at the gun store with the gun. Of course. credentials as a former FBI agent is probably good enough to get through a gun check. Concealed carry permit. there is reciprocity in Wyoming for that. They did not think there would be any problem. They looked at it and put it into the system and got word back that he would know in 5 days. Well. it is a long trip to get a gun. The person had a gun that was just like it. He was convinced of the credentials. so they went to his house and finished the transaction. The fellow from Colorado went home. The fellow from Cheyenne went down to retrieve his other gun. He found out that it is now in the Federal system. So he can have a background check done on himself to get his own gun back. So there are difficulties with the gun check. They are not immediate. There is not a computer that immediately says: This person is not in there so go ahead and sell them a gun. It can be a 5day process. which. for a 3day gun show can be a bit of a problem. or even a shorter one than that. I want to talk a little more broadly about gun rights because the Senate will be voting on proposals today that affect rights not created by the law but. rather. were created by the Constitution that last a lot longer than anything we do in this body. Wyoming is a State of gun owners. A large number of Wyoming residents grow up learning to respect and lawfully use firearms. As a matter of fact. many schools and youth organizations build hunter safety and gun safety into their curriculums so that young people become familiar with the responsibilities of gun ownership at an early age. Therefore. it should be no surprise that a majority of Wyoming residents have called on me to oppose any legislation that puts additional restrictions on the freedoms they enjoy and use daily. I have been saying for some time that the bill before the Senate does not focus on the problem. There is no doubt that we need to do more to curb the senseless acts of violence which continue to occur in this country. One of the things we need is parents to be more careful and more repetitive at telling their kids it is not right to kill people. it is not even right to bully them. and it is definitely not right for them to kill themselves. Until we can get that message across to our kids. I hope that we do not rely on a few votes by this body to make everybody feel comfortable that all of the problems are taken care of. They will not be. The Senate should focus on making sure current laws are enforced. they are not. Finally. our Nation and its communities should be doing more to foster the idea that life has to be respected. However. the problem with several of the proposals we will vote on today is that they add to programs with track records of failure. Additionally. I oppose limiting the rights of gun owners to transfer their firearms to their neighbor or loan hunting rifles to their family members. The underlying bill the Senate is debating would restrict that right in many areas and would only make gun ownership more burdensome on lawful citizens. My colleagues in other States may not realize this. but in Wyoming guns are not used just for selfdefense and recreation. They are a tool. Ask the rancher who uses a rifle to defend his livestock from predation or the outfitter who uses a gun to protect clients in the back country. Firearms do have everyday uses in Wyoming. Sometimes it is necessary to transfer or loan a gun to a nephew. a niece. or an employee. But under what is being considered. that right may be severely infringed. I do not condone acts of gun violence. I am a father and a grandfather and will do everything I can to keep guns out of the wrong hands. However. I am not willing to infringe on the constitutional right of lawful gun owners when the laws already designed to protect us are being unenforced. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
1130016649,To return to the discussion on marketplace fairness. I mentioned that most consumers are aware they are supposed to pay the tax on purchases that the retailer does not choose to collect at the time of the purchase. so I would like to provide some highlights of what the Marketplace Fairness Act actually accomplishes. The bill gives the States the right to decide to collect or not collect taxes that are already owed. The legislation would simplify and streamline the countrys more than 9.000 diverse State tax jurisdictions and provide 2 options by which States could begin collecting sales taxes from online and catalog purchases. The bill also carves out small businesses so that they wont be adversely affected by the new law by exempting businesses with less than $1 million in online or outofState sales from the collection requirements until they have had a year in which they have had more than $1 million worth of sales. This small business exemption will protect small merchants and give new businesses time to get started. As has been mentioned. when they meet that level. then they have to be provided with a program that will do the calculations for them. provide for submitting the revenues. and also hold them harmless for any errors there might be in the program. So dont let the critics get away with saying this type of simplification cant be done. The different tax rates and jurisdictions are no problem for todays software programs. When you order something online. you have to put in your ZIP Code. The ZIP Code will tell what the tax is from whatever jurisdiction. As a former mayor and State legislator. I strongly favor allowing States the authority to require sales and use tax collection from retailers on all sales for each State that chooses to do so. We need to implement a plan that will allow States to collect revenue using mechanisms already approved by their local leaders. We need to allow States the ability to collect the sales taxes they already require. If enacted. it would provide approximately $23 billion in fiscal relief for States for which Congress does not have to find an offset. This will give States less of an excuse to come knocking at the Federal door for handouts and will reduce the problem of federally attached strings. A lot of people dont realize that the Federal Government is out of money. and that is shown by what was done through the sequester because the Federal Government usually pays property tax to States and localities that have Federal property. That amount has never been equal to what other people would be paying in their property taxes. but it has been a show of good faith that they recognize that with the government there. there is a loss of revenue and that the Federal Government should do something. So there is a tax level they have been paying. It hasnt gone up much and it hasnt gone down much until this year. Then. as part of the sequester. they decided they would hold 5.3 percent from all the States and all the local governments. That is called payment in lieu of taxes. and that is one way the States and the counties have lost money and a way they are going to have to make up for it if that continues. But there is also the possibility that the revenue they take in from this can reduce something like property taxes. For many years I have worked with all the interested parties to find a mutually agreeable legislative package to introduce and ultimately enact into public law. This year Senators DURBIN. ALEXANDER. HEITKAMP. and I worked together with 25 of our bipartisan Senate colleagues to produce a bill that assists sellers and State and local governments to simplify taxes and use collection and administration. We are working with our House supportersRepresentatives STEVE WOMACK. JACKIE SPEIER. PETER WELCH. and JOHN CONYERSand have found common ground on this important issue to move forward with a bipartisan. bicameral bill in this Congress. I wish to publicly commend all of my Senate and House colleagues in taking a leadership role and working on this important issue. The Marketplace Fairness Act is about States rights. and it is about fairness on the budget bill. We had a vote on this. and I was very pleased that 75 of the 100 Senators voted in favor of making the marketplace fair. So I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for the motion to proceed on S. 743. the Marketplace Fairness Act. tonight at 5:30 when we have that vote. I am hoping we will be able to duplicate what we did before and support the goals of States rights and a level playing field for all businesses. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1130035215,"Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for expediting the confirmation of Greg Phillips. I rise this afternoon to add strong support for the confirmation of Gregory Alan Phillips to serve as a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I believe Mr. Phillips has all the characteristics necessary to serve as a Federal appellate judge. I worked with Mr. Phillips in the Wyoming Legislature and can say with confidence that he is recognized throughout the Wyoming legal community as a talented. respected. and thoughtful attorney. This vote is also important because the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has experienced a number of judicial vacancies recently. In February the Senate confirmed Judge Bacharach of Oklahoma to the panel. and we now have the opportunity to fill another vacancy so the Tenth Circuit can continue its work. Mr. Phillips has served as Wyomings attorney general since 2011. The attorney general is not an elected position in Wyoming. and it is important to note that Mr. Phillips was appointed by Governor Mead. although they do not share the same party affiliation. This speaks tremendously to Mr. Phillips talent and legal reputation. Governor Mead and former U.S. attorney comments that Greg is a ""firstrate legal thinker. a tireless worker and has an abiding sense of fair play."" Governor Mead goes on to say that if confirmed. all those who appear before Mr. Phillips will find ""a judge fully prepared. engaged. and respectful to all."" Mr. Phillips was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with a unanimous vote on April 18. The fact that he now stands for a vote after only being nominated in January is a credit to his abilities and strong bipartisan support. I thank Chairman LEAHY. Ranking Member GRASSLEY. and members of the Judiciary Committee for reviewing and moving this nomination along so quickly. It is no surprise that the American Bar Association unanimously gave Mr. Phillips its highest rating. Greg has extensive experience practicing law as a deputy county attorney and in private practice. Before becoming Wyomings attorney general. Mr. Phillips served 7 years as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Wyoming. handling criminal prosecutions and appeals. Greg has extensive experience arguing in Federal court. including taking nearly 20 cases before the Tenth Circuit. Mr. Phillips studied economics at the University of Wyoming and graduated with honors from the Wyoming College of Law. where he was on the Law Review. Immediately following law school Mr. Phillips served as a clerk for U.S. district judge Alan Johnson of Wyoming. Judge Johnson writes that Greg is ""devoted to the rule of law and will honor the remarkable judicial officers who preceded him."" Specifically. Judge Johnson notes that Mr. Phillips thorough study of the U.S. sentencing guidelines. experience as a Federal criminal prosecutor. and understanding of State and Federal legal issues will serve him well on the Tenth Circuit. Mr. Phillips also has strong support from his colleagues from around the Nation. Thirtyfour attorneys general wrote the Senate Judiciary Committee in March expressing their support for the nomination. I am told there would have been more signatures on that letter. but the nomination was advanced so diligently that some did not get a chance to sign the letter before Gregs hearing. I would like to conclude by saying that I can personally attest to Mr. Phillips qualifications to serve as a Federal judge. Greg was on the senate Judiciary Committee when we served together in the Wyoming Legislature. On the senate floor. we sat across the aisle from each otherand I do not mean just across the RepublicanDemocratic aisle. I mean right next to each other across the aisleand got to visit a lot. He was a part of formulating my 80 percent rule for legislating. Greg and his family are highly respected in their Wyoming community. and Wyoming is proud to call Greg one of our own. He will be an outstanding judge to follow Terry OBrien. another longtime friend of mine. Terry and I. when he was a Wyoming District Court judge and I was in the Wyoming State senate. used to have dinner together to solve the worlds problems. Then I became a U.S. Senator and he became a U.S. circuit court judge. I know his successor will honorably fill that seat. Mr. Phillips is highly qualified to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. and I call on my colleagues to also support his confirmation. Lets get this man to work in his new job. I yield the floor."
1130037960,"Mr. President. I wish to speak today on the nomination of Richard Cordray to be the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I want to speak against this confirmation. Why is this nomination important? Once the Director is approved by Congress. by the Senatenot all the Congress. just by the Senatewe will no longer have any control over a bureau that collects everyones financial records in detail and can cancel a loan up to 180 days even if both parties to the loan are happy. Mr. Cordray was recessappointed. I think it was because the President thought he would not be approved by Congress. What I am about to tell you already is under the direction of this nominee. That recess appointment put him in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It sounds like a good title. but the reason this is of utmost concern to me and has been for the past 3 years is the lack of congressional oversight and blatant privacy intrusions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. the CFPB. The DoddFrank Act. which created the CFPB. has been a hot topic of conversation since its passage in 2010. There are a lot of important discussions about different parts of the bill and some of the consequences we are seeing now. 3 years down the road. These are all important conversations to have. but today I am focusing on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bureau. as allowed by the DoddFrank Act. could direct up to $600 million every year. but it is not subject to the congressional appropriations processthe same congressional appropriations process that approves the budgets of the other agencies. such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Instead. the agency is funded from revenues from the Federal Reservethe Federal Reservebefore the revenues come to the Treasury. funds that are supposed to be remitted to the Treasury for deficit reduction. Some might ask: Isnt there a cap to the funding available to the CFPB? Yes. there is. but here is what it looks like. The cap was 10 percent of the Federal revenues for fiscal year 2010. 11 percent for fiscal year 2012. and it will be 12 percent for fiscal year 2013. with an inflation factor each and every year after that. This means 12 percent of the combined earnings of the Federal Reserve System. which was $4.98 billion in 2009. At that time. 10 percent would have been $500 million. These numbers are astonishing. and anyone saying that the Bureau is not funded by taxpayers is trying to pull a sleightofhand. The funds may not come directly from the Treasury. but taxpayers are going to have to take up the slack for funds they are no longer receiving from the Federal Reserve. I am not sure how we do that constitutionally. to move somebody outside and still take Federal money. In addition. the Director of the Bureau has unlimited discretion over how the agencys moneythese hundreds of millions of dollars I just talked aboutis spent. Let me repeat that. The Director of the Bureau has unlimited discretion over how the agencys money is spent. He doesnt submit a budget. Nothing is approved. Not only that. the Director is allowed to put fines and penalties collected by the Bureau into a slush fund that it does not have to return to the Treasury the way other agencies have to do. Do you think that might encourage a lot of fines and penalties by this Bureau? I think it would. I dont think it ought to be done that way. The same Director who has so much unchecked authority doesnt even answer to the Office of Management and Budget and only has to submit routine financial information to the Office. There is also no inspector general for this Bureau. Here is one example of why that is a problem. The DoddFrank Act expressly exempted auto dealers from the oversight purview of the Bureau. They listened to me when this bill was passing and found out that loans could be canceled within 180 days by the Bureau without the approval of the automobile dealer or the person who bought the automobile. However. the Bureau doesnt think auto dealers should be exempt from oversight. so it found ways to exert itself through the banks. Banks are now looking at auto loans made. and the Bureau has issued its first significant penalty in connection with the vehicle financing. The Bureau has also issued what it calls a fair lending guidance bulletin directed at institutions that make indirect automobile loans. In it the Bureau says indirect lenders will be viewed as participants in any discriminatory pricing by dealers due to their role in the auto loan credit decision process and suggests lenders impose controls on dealer markup and compensation policies. Is this revenge for them getting an exemption in the bill? The Bureaus interpretation of DoddFrank and this guidance will have wide ramifications for indirect lenders and ultimately auto dealers. Because the bulletin issued is considered guidance and not a rule. there has been no opportunity for the publicincluding consumers. lenders. and dealersto comment on this policy interpretation that will affect an industry that was exempted from the Bureau oversight. The lack of accountability and congressional oversight over the Bureaus budget and Director are troubling. to say the least. but the picture becomes even more concerning when the lens is shifted to what kinds of oversight power are afforded to and being practiced by this Bureauthis Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It sounds like it is for everybody. Here is what I said when expressing my concern about this Bureau and the DoddFrank Act on May 20. 2010: This bill was supposed to be about regulating Wall Street. instead its creating a Google Earth on every financial transaction. Thats rightthe government will be able to see every detail of your finances. Your permission is not needed. They can look at your transactions from the 50.000 foot perspective or they can look right down to the tiny details of the time and place where you pulled cash out of an ATM or charged to your credit card. Unfortunately. we are now finding this fear has become a reality. A recent Bloomberg article states that the Bureau is demanding records from banks and buying information from companies on at least 10 million American consumers for ""use in a wide range of policy research projects."" This information gathering from banks includes credit card and checking account overdraft information as well as requirements to provide records on credit cards and on products such as credit monitoring. In addition to the bank records it is collecting. the Bureau is collecting data on payday loans from debt collection agencies and building a mortgage database of loan and property records with information from agencies and other financial and property information holders."
1130071271,Madam President. I rise today to again express my great disappointment about a matter of importance to Wyoming and many other public land States that have not been properly addressed by this omnibus bill in the Senate. Instead of producing a legislative solution based on discussions with our colleagues. debate and consideration in committee. and a fair and complete process on the floor. we have a bill before us that was put together by making another deal. Simply put. the Senate fails to do its job when we refuse to allow a fair. free. and open debate about an issue that is of such great concern to the people who will be affected by the decision. It is no secret. anyone who has seen the Senate in operation as we take up this legislation will know that the backroom deal does not include critical funding that nearly 1.900 counties in 49 States49 States. that is all but 1and 3 U.S. territories rely on. One would think this kind of participation would draw an extraordinary amount of interest by us all to make sure this bill was written with the best interests of all the States and all of our constituents in mind. Unfortunately. that doesnt appear to be the case. So what program is it that draws such interest from 1.900 counties. 3 territories. 49 Statesconcern from such a widespread portion of our Nation? I am speaking. of course. of payments in lieu of taxes. It is a program that has been in place for decades. it is not an issue that is new to the Senate. That is why I recently led an effort by several of my Senate colleagues urging that appropriators include this critical funding in the Interior appropriations. If they had done that. we would have already completed the work to produce a wellreasoned. wellthoughtout answer to an issue of such importance to the States. Unfortunately. our efforts seem to have fallen on deaf ears. so here I am before my colleagues hoping with all my heart that I can make the Senate understand how crucial this funding is to almost every State in the Union. This body often overlooks the important role of local government in the lives of our constituents. I know this because before I came to the Senate I served as a mayor. as did another handful of people in this body. and I know there are several others who have been county officials. Communities and counties are responsible for providing fire protection. law enforcement. sanitation. public health. and education. just to name a few. They provide these services largely by raising revenue. One common source is through property taxes. In States where there is little federally owned land. local communities have a large number of private homeowners to help provide these services. However. there are States where the Federal Government decided to retain most if not a majority of its ownership of the land. The problem is that these Federal lands cannot be taxed. Yet local governments must still provide critical fire. law enforcement. and health services in these areas and for the people who work on them. In order to make up this shortfall. Congress created payment in lieu of taxes to compensate local governments to offset the losses caused by having nontaxable Federal lands within their boundaries. For decades. the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program has provided counties and local governments with funding to help meet critical community needs. One of the reasons the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program was instituted was because of the creation of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. which placed a major hurdle on the Federal Government from disposing of public lands. In place of the Federal Governments ability to move land from Federal to private ownership Congress decided to reimburse county and local governments with payments that would replace the revenue lost from the property taxes they would have received if those Federal lands had been transferred to private ownership. It seemed the only fair thing to do back then. and it is still only fair to live up to our obligations as a nation to provide the States with the revenue they are losing because of the laws we have enacted. I have to tell you. we are talking about 1.900 counties in the United States. 49 States. In some of those counties. it is 40 percent to 80 percent of their total revenue. That is a big cut to makein 1 year. No transition. just boom. gone. How do you adjust to that if you are those local government people trying to figure out how to balance your budget? After all. I am not aware of anybody who lives at the Federal level. They all live at the local level. So it is the local folks who have to take care of the people. If we fail to adequately address this issue. we are forcing our communities to make do with lessa lot lessbecause we are breaking a promise we have made. By doing so. we are forcing them to reduceor even eliminatethe vital resources upon which their citizens rely. I wish to emphasize and make it clear that this is not an additional source of revenue. It is not a bonus. County and local governments depend on this revenue when they plan their budgets each year. It is part of the law. They count on it. and without it. their budgets are stretched and strained and they will be bankrupt. The decision by the Appropriations Committee to not include the vital payment in lieu of taxes funding in the omnibus will place counties across the country in very difficult positions and great financial hardship for them all. especially since there was no transition. there was no warning. It was just done. We need to stop playing games with the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program and find a way to ensure it is adequately and fairly funded now and for years to come. We could learn a lesson from local governments. I remind you. that is where everyone lives. Many are obligated to have a balanced budget. That forces communities to budget in advance. debate priorities. and stick to considering spending measures through the normal legislative process. As we look for ways to adequately fund payment in lieu of taxes. we also need to be sure we are not robbing Peter to pay Paul. I was extremely disappointed about the provision in the conference reportnow. a conference report comes to us for an upordown vote. We do not have any chance to debate them on the floor. We do not have a chance to amend it. But the conference report for the highway reauthorization in 2012 robbed the abandoned mine land trust fundtrust fundto pay for the payment in lieu of taxes obligation that time. They got paid. though. but we stole from a trust fund to do it. Again. it was a conference report. so there was no opportunity for amendments on itjust like this omnibus. States rely on those funds to clean up highpriority abandoned mines. We should not pit those funds against each other. Yes. the Federal Government is out of money. We are going to have to prioritize. We are going to have to move some things around. We are going to have to bring down the deficits so eventually we can hopefully bring down the debt. This is not the only time we have been doing this sort of thing. Twice now we have robbed the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Where do they get their money? Any private companyprivate company. not Federal companyany private company that has a pension fund has to pay a tax into this Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation so that in case they go out of business. the people who were promised a retirement will be compensated. They will get compensated 60 percent of what they were promisedjust 60 percent. But we have raised that amount dramatically twice now on private corporations that were providing retirement for their workers. That is all voluntary. They do not have to provide retirements for their workers. If we keep raising that amount. and it does not go to provide assurance that their employees will get their retirement. why would they keep their retirement going? People are going to lose retirement in the United States. Nobody is starting defined benefit plans right now because of the extra taxes we are putting on it. Twice now we have raised that price. and we have put it to something other than it was promised for. Here is the real kicker: We said that for the next 8 years we are going to steal that money. so we can spend that amount this year. I am not sure it is legal. How do we force future Congresses to be sure to pay the moneyno. we will have already spent the moneyso we are asking them to pay back the money. and we are asking them to steal it out of a trust fund. We have to quit stealing from the trust funds. That is the same thing with the abandoned mine land trust fund. That was stealing for 10 years to pay for 2 years. We cannot keep doing that. Somehow we have to have the kind of budgeting we are expecting these local governments. these towns and cities and counties to do. where they have to balance their budget. We do not have to balance our budget. We just steal the money. But there is a point at which we cannot steal the money anymore. What do we do now next time on the Transportation bill. when we have already obligated 8 more years of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to the current highways? We will not have collected that yet. Where do we steal it from next time? Infrastructure is extremely important. We are going to have to eventually prioritize around here. We are going to have to do the same thing we expect of those towns and counties that we are stealing the payment in lieu of taxes money from in order to keep this business afloat. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program represents a promise we made to counties and local governments all across the Nation. They are looking to us to see how we will act and to see how we will keep that promise. If we fail to do so. it will have an impact on almost every one of us who will surely hear about the repercussions when we go back home to meet with our constituents. I encourage and urge the Senate in the strongest terms to reconsider the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program and the impact we may be bringing to people across the Nation by failing to include it in this legislation. These are governments thatthey have property taxes on the private property. What happens if the people with the private property do not pay their taxes? The local government gets to put a lien on it and gets to put it on the market. Maybe that is what we ought to do with this Federal land: put a lien on it. put it on the market. It is a debt the Federal Government said they would pay and they are not paying. It is payment in lieu of property taxes. If the property taxes are not paid. there is a way the local government can make up for it. but there is not if the Federal Government just decides to quit paying. and that is kind of what we did. We said taxes are hard to pay. If everybody in America said taxes are hard to pay and quit paying them. we would be in one heck of a fix. We cannot do that to the towns and counties either. I yield the floor.
1130103144,Madam President. I rise today to speak in favor of the reauthorization of Workforce Investment Act. I first thank Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON of Georgia. Senator PATTY MURRAY of Washington. Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER of Tennessee. and Senator TOM HARKIN of Iowa for their hard work on this bill. We can see from that list of Senators alone that this has been a truly bipartisan effort to reauthorize this Workforce Investment Act. Of course. we have heard through the course of this discussion how on the House side KLINE. MILLER. Foxx. and HINOJOSA worked on it. which is bipartisan on that side of the building. And the two have been working together. which is bicameral. That doesnt happen a lot around here. but on bills that make it through to the Presidents signature it does happen. and it has happened on this one. I thank the many Senators who have had suggestions for this bill. A lot of those suggestions have wound up in here. Some of them had amendments that we will have to continue to work on in the future. and they were very gracious in revising some of those so that they would fit what we are doing and still get the bill done. I know TIM SCOTT could have taken a lot more credit for what he did in the House and when it came over here. but he has been extremely cooperative in using his knowledge of the bill to further the bill. Senator PORTMAN is another critical Senator in working on it. and as we can tell by the passionate speech by Senator COBURN. there are things that could be done and will need to be done in the future to make it an even better bill. But it is something that all of government ought to be doingnot just the workforce. This is a day of elation for me. We have been working to improve this program for over 11 years. For 11 years this could have made a big difference in our countrys jobs. The Workforce Investment Act has been due for reauthorization for 11 years. Who says the Senate works fast? Who says the Senate works slow? Hopefully. the Senate works and gets it right. I am hopeful that now is the time we are able to get this important piece of legislation renewed and provide some muchneeded help to American workers and businesses through the new profile it provides. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will transform the sometimes bureaucratic Federal job training system into a streamlined program that can help many more people learn the skills they need to get meaningful jobs. The reauthorization will eliminate 15 programs identified as ineffective or duplicativewe dont do that very oftenand 21 Federal mandates on State and local workforce boards. That is what we need to be doing throughout government. This bill would apply common performance measures for all programs with the focus on employment outcomes and employer satisfaction with the trained workers. This will provide stronger accountability for taxpayer dollars. These are all changes that are long overdue. This piece of legislation also gives authority back to the State governments and equips them with tools to help small businesses. This bill provides Governors and State workforce directors what they told us they needed in hearing after hearing. They wanted flexibility to use the money where it was most needed. There were stovepipes where we required them to do certain things with the money even if they didnt have customers that needed that part of the stovepipe. which meant that some of the money went begging. So by actually eliminating some of the stovepipes. making the money more effective in this program. it increases the value of the money that is there. With this reauthorization States will better be able to meet the regional economic demand and provide training for jobs in which quality workers are in short supply. We can help people get back to work by offering training for the skills and services needed in their community. State and local officials are in the best position to determine the labor and job training needs of communities across the Nation. The workforce and opportunity act will help improve our current stagnated economy and foster economic development for private sector job creation. If it works as it should. hundreds of thousands of people will be able to move into available jobs that are vacant because folks dont have the right skills. I remember the New York Times sent reporters out to see if there were any jobs available in the New York area. They came back and reported there were thousands of jobs. there just werent people trained to be able to do those jobs. That is what this bill is designed to do. Local businesses will finally be able to find workers who live in their communities who have a particular skill set that they need for their business. The job training program that is included in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is what would get our economy going again. Job training programs are especially important to smallpopulation States such as Wyoming where skilled workers are in high demand and the supply is short. We recently broke ground on the Wind River Job Corps Center in Riverton. WY. The sevenbuilding center will house 300 students and be the first of its kind in Wyoming. When the center opens in the next year or so. my constituents will be able to get the job training they need to succeed in their careers. This project would not have been possible without the determination of the people of Wyoming. the cooperation of the communities around there to provide facilities. the land that was necessary. and legislation like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. I particularly want to thank Senator HARKIN for his recognition as part of the Appropriations Committee that Wyoming and New Hampshire were the two States that didnt have job corps centers and the help he gave us in being sure there was money set aside to be able to do that job corps center. I also appreciate the emphasis on the youth bill that is in there where young people can work during the summer to actually learn a trade while they improve their community. On a broader scale. America is facing an economic climate that threatens our ability as a nation to compete in the global marketplace. This bill sends a clear message that we are serious about helping our American workers and employers remain competitive and that we are serious about closing the skills gap that is putting Americas longterm competitiveness in jeopardy. I have been on the floor recently discussing articles that declared that our current Congress could be the worst ever and that negotiating political agreements is a lost art. More often than not this year Senators have had no opportunity to weigh in and dissenting opinions are rarely considered. But the HELP Committee has broken through the logjam and produced a bipartisan bill with a bicameral effort that is going to get through the Senate without cloture. without filling the amendment tree. or any of the other procedural tricks. That is a testament to the hard work of Senators HARKIN. ALEXANDER. MURRAY. ISAKSON. and their staffs and others who have worked on this bill. Their efforts are an example all of us should keep in mind in thinking about how we can and should operate. Almost half of todays sitting Senators have been here less than 6 years. so they havent seen many times when the Senate has worked as it should. as it could. as it did. I urge them to keep this Workforce Investment Act bill in mind.
1130112603,Mr. President. I rise today to speak about an amendment that I filed with the Highway and Transportation Funding Act. While my amendment did not get a vote. the issue it addresses is very important to my home State so I want to take a minute today to talk about the issue and the need to address a situation that was created when we passed the MAP21 conference report in 2012. The conference report undid a carefully constructed compromise on the Abandoned Mine Land Program that was put together in 2006. It took apart the work that we had done by limiting the total annual payments of AML funds to $15 million per year. That is a change that only affected the State of Wyoming. We usually dont do legislation that only affects one State when a number of them receive funds. What was worse. the provision was not in the House or Senate highway bill. It was added in the dead of night without consulting anyone from the Wyoming congressional delegation. I was extremely disappointed that the provision was included in the conference report because Senators from other coalproducing States and I spent years working on this issue. When the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was passed in 1977. a tax was levied on each ton of coal that was produced. The purpose of that tax was to reclaim the coal mines that had been abandoned before the enactment of the reclamation laws. Half of that tax was promised to the States where the coal was mined. That was known as the State share. The other half went to the Federal Government to administer the reclamation program and to provide additional funding to the States with the most abandoned coal mines. It was a simple enough concept. Unfortunately. like many things in Washington. while the concept was good. clear. and wellintentioned. its implementation was a nightmare and the program did not work as Congress intended. For years States were shortchanged and the reclamation work was not done or the States did it themselves at their own expense. expecting to get reimbursed. That is the case in Wyoming. At one point the Federal Government owed the States more than $1.2 billion. while more than $3 billion in reclamation programs remained incomplete and unfinished. The issued pitted the East against the West and the debate was always the same. When Members from the East would argue that we should send more money to the States to support reclamation efforts. my colleagues from the West were just as certain that we needed to keep the Federal Governments promise to the States to provide the revenue they were entitled to under the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. In 2006. a bipartisan coalition of Senatorsincluding mefixed the broken AML structure. It started with Senator Santorum approaching me with a proposal that had the support of a number of local coal companies. also the United Mine Workers of America. several environmental groups. and other businesses. After listening to the proposal. I laid out a set of principles that had to be included in their proposal if they were going to gain my support. First I wanted to see the return of the money owed to the States. which included $550 million owed to my State. Because Wyoming is a certified State. I also wanted to see the money that came from the Federal Government with no strings attached. The legislation accomplished that goal by guaranteeing that Wyoming was to receive the money owed from the Federal Government over a 7year period. This is money in a trust fund. Trust funds are kind of interesting to the Federal Government. We put money in the drawer and then we take money out and put bonds in the drawer. Think about that in Social Security. It is another one of our trust funds. and I am one of the protectors. This was a trust fund but there were only bonds in there. so it was difficult for us to get any money. I wanted to guarantee that future moneys would be paid to States such as Wyoming where significant amounts of coal were produced. We are where most of the Federal half of the tax comes from. Third. it was important that more money be directed toward reclamation in the States where it was needed. More money was needed. And fourth. there had to be a provision for orphan miners health. Sometimes that is kind of overlooked. but Senator Byrd and Senator ROCKEFELLER were very adamant on that. What is an orphan miner? That was a miner who was promised health care and then their mine went out of business. So there is no company to pay in anymore so they can get their health care. and we made a provision to take care of that. The legislation that we put together accomplished all four of those goals. We continued our efforts as a bipartisan group. and in December 2006 we passed the AML reauthorization as part of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. The coal industry and the United Mine Workers of America supported the bill. Members from certified States less Wyoming supported the compromise. as did members from uncertified States such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia. As a Senator. President Obama voted in favor of the legislation that included this compromise. From all signs it appeared we had finally fixed our problem and helped strengthen our State economies at the same time. Unfortunately. appearances are often deceiving. By limited AML payments in the MAP21 conference report. Congress once again made clear that taxpayers could not count on a Federal trust fund to meet its obligations to administer the tax dollars it collected each year in a proper and legislatively mandated manner. This has been contested and successfully defended year after year to preserve this money. and it was supported by a supermajority from this body untiluntilit was included in this highway bill and included in the highway bill in the conference report. not when we had an amendment on the floor that we could once again successfully defeat with a supermajority. It came in the middle of the night. and the next day we had an opportunity to vote for the highway bill. The highway bill is probably one of the most crucial bills to any State in the Nation. and if all you get to do is vote yes or no. you are not going to take a look at a little portion of the bill where we steal a trust fund from one StateWyomingand that is exactly what happened. and it passed. My amendment to the highway bill this time will address the problem and put things back together the way they were meant to be. Simply put. it will ensure that when a State has been promised it will receive AML funds. it will receive them. Fortunately. I have the intent of Congress and the support of many colleagues on this matter of such great concern to Wyoming and to all the coalproducing States. I want to particularly thank Senators HATCH and WYDEN for their commitment to address this issue created by the MAP21 conference report. This isnt just a problem for Wyoming. because the next time a conference committee goes looking for some money. they can steal it from another AML State. My amendment also encouraged the production of energy right here at home by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The Congressional Budget Office estimates such an effort will increase gross Federal receipts by $5 billion over 10 years. That is more than we need to make this payment. There are other possibilities for offsets as well. but that is one that is rather meaty. and that is more than enough to pay the funds that were stolen from Wyoming over 10 years and to pay for 2 years worth of transportation projects. not just a shortterm fix on transportation. I know my colleagues will see the importance of this matter for Wyoming and to all the coalproducing States. It is important we take a look at this and protect the validity of trust funds that we set up and not redo them without adequate debate or an actual vote on the trust fund that we are violating. We have done that on a couple of other trust funds as well. One of the ones that we also did was to impose an additional tax on those companies that have private pension funds. because we have a Pension Benefit Guaranty trust fund that is designed so that if a company goes out of business a worker who works for one of those businesses will get at least 60 percent of what they were supposed to get in their retirement. That is why it is called the Pension Benefit Guaranty trust fund. We increased the amount that had to be put in by $80 per employee for each of the companies involved. and that was going to the trust fund to make sure those funds would be available. But we diverted those funds before they got to the trust fund because the actual money could be replaced by bonds in the drawer of the trust fund. That money went to highways. and that is just another example of how we are taking money from 10 years worth of trust funds and using it for 2year projects. We have to change that. and my amendment will be one of the ways of making that change. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
1130115842,"Mr. President. I wish to discuss legislation pending before the Senate which wages an unprecedented attack on a fundamental American freedom. The Framers of our Constitution were clear when they stated in the Bill of Rights .. . ""Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the free exercise of speech."" However. this week. the Senate majority has sought to undermine this fundamental freedom by offering a constitutional amendment to give Congress more control over the free speech rights of Americans. I opposed moving forward with this amendment because political speech is essential to the American way of life. Our Nation was founded on those who openly criticized the king and argued for a better form of government. All branches of our government rely on the ability for Americans to passionately defend their interests. Additionally. when we elect candidates for office we the electorate rely on open dialog about why he or she ought to serve a particular community or State. The Constitution would have never been adopted without the Bill of Rights. Political speech is exactly the type of expression the Founders sought to protect when they adopted the Bill of Rightshowever. this proposal completely forgets about that freedom. Giving the Federal Government the ability to regulate what we say is flat out dangerous. What is a reasonable limitation on political speech? The sponsors of this proposal cant answer that and it is reckless to assume that Federal courts will determine the correct answer. What concerns me the most is where does this regulation stop? The answer is not clear and at the very end of the day this constitutional amendment limits the way in which Americans can voice their concerns about their elected officials. With all that the Senate needs to accomplish it is an embarrassment that the majority leader would bring this up now. not allow amendments and expect this institution to forget about the very freedoms our Founders sought to protect when they drafted our Federal Constitution."

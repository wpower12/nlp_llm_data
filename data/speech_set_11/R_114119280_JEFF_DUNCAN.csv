1140001908,"I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership on this issue. not just today. but for her whole tenure in Congress. As the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. I was grateful to see the return of Alan Gross to the United States last month after 5 years of unjust imprisonment in Cuba. The announcement over this past weekend that the Cubans freed 53 prisoners was also welcome news. Nevertheless. I have major concerns with the way this administration. the Obama administration. conducted negotiations and the way the decision was made to radically alter longstanding U.S. policy towards Cuba. The administration failed to consult Congress. failed to consult any Cuban dissidents or civil society in its decision to embark on its new course in Cuba. The administration says this decision will empower the Cuban people. yet softening U.S. policy without concrete Cuban reforms will only boost the Castro regime and government and facilitate the survival of the communist regime. We need to focus not on what is best for the Cuban Government. the Castro regime. we need to focus on what is best for the Cuban people. I ask you this: Will this deal mean more selfgovernance for the Cuban people? Will it mean more economic freedom for those who strive to innovate. those that are entrepreneurial within the Cuban society? Will they be able to start more businesses and have economic freedom? Will there be more religious freedom for the Cuban people? Will there be more rights to free speech? Are the Cuban people seeing this debate tonight on Cuban TV? Are the Cuban people able to access the Internet and watch what we are doing via YouTube or any other media? These are rhetorical questions. but I answer them with ""no."" based on my understanding. I recall it was only 1 week after the announcement of this U.S.-Cuba deal that the Cuban Government cracked down on peaceful protestors in Havanas Revolutionary Square. I point to that as evidence that it is still a closed communistic society. In conclusion. the administrations decision is a reward to the communist dictatorship at the expense of the Cuban people. This action is especially disgraceful when we consider the administrations disrespect toward our friend and ally in Canada by vowing to veto legislation approving the construction of the Keystone pipeline. These are issues that require vigorous congressional oversight. I look forward to working with the ranking member. Mr. SIRES. that you just heard from. as we hold hearings in the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere in the coming weeks and month."
1140020864,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize an exceptional group of students. teachers. and parents of the Bell Street Middle School Science Olympiad Team. which just won their 13th consecutive Science Olympiad State championship. Let me repeat that: the 13th straight Science Olympiad State championship. a remarkable group of parents. teachers. and students. The Science Olympiad program is one of the premier science competition programs in the Nation. which for the past 31 years has been dedicated to interscholastic academic competition that provides a series of individual and team events requiring the knowledge of scientific facts. concepts. processes. skills. and science applications. They provide constantly changing challenges to nearly 7.000 teams across all 50 States that allow for students to be exposed to a variety of career choices while meeting practicing scientists and lifechanging mentors. The Bell Street Middle School in Clinton. South Carolina. began competing in this competition in 1986. The Science Olympiad team here was founded by three exceptional teachers: Dr. Rosemary Wicker. Dr. David OShields. and Michael Mack. Mr. Mack and Dr. David OShields still work in the school district today. and Dr. OShields is the superintendent of Laurens County School District 56. He continues to be a part of the team and coaches the Bell Street Middle School Science Olympiad. Many of the Bell Street Science Olympiad alumni have gone on to be extremely successful in the fields of science and technology. One example is Elizabeth Humbert. who went on to obtain a masters degree in geology at the University of Tennessee and later went on to help manage mastodon excavation at the Paleontological Research Institution in Ithaca. New York. She also participated in the Hyde Park Mastodon Project. which was the discovery of the most complete mastodon to date. She has spent countless hours working in outreach to students through helping to build the Museum of the Earth and through an outreach position at Cornell University for NASA. through which she helped build the STEM internships across the State of New York for underrepresented students. Today Elizabeth is living on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. developing a class for upper elementary school students on their regional ecology and geology. When asked about her love for science. Elizabeth states: My building block. my love for learning. my discovery that I could do what I found interesting. dates specifically back to Bell Street Middle School and to our Challenge classes. to enjoying the freedom and the openended research it offered and to Science Olympiad and the connections it created. Of her experience participating in Science Olympiad. she states it provided her with ""the feeling that being different might not be a burden. but a great blessing and an exciting path to follow. Science for me has always been that exciting path and perhaps an unusual one in 1994. I have been so glad to see more women in the field in these last 20 years. I know Science Olympiad fosters that in all students and creates visions of possibilities that really exist."" she said. Mr. Speaker. I believe that her statement sums up how valuable this organization has been and continues to be to our Nations youth. This years students are continuing this history of success and innovation with their firstplace finishes in 11 of the State competitions 20 events. One event in particular required students to create a wheeled vehicle that could travel a specific distance in the shortest amount of time. This year the length of the track was longer than in previous years. and there was a coffee can placed in the middle of the track. I have got a graphic here to kind of show you what that is. Students lost points if the car went over the finish line or didnt stop close enough to it. In order to be successful in this event. Dillon Snead created a formula based on what he is learning in his geometry class. He created a triangle with a square ruler which he accurated with his car and then used a formula to calculate the distance from the starting pointstarting point being hereto the ending point. This allowed him to create an arch with a point 1/12th of the total distance. Using this formula. Dillon and his partner. Alyssa Shiflet. were able to create a car that stopped 2 centimeters away from the finish line. winning the team first place. This victory helped the team achieve the overall first place award at the State competition. You can look at this Web site and actually watch a video. They had to take a motorized vehicle that they created. calculate the distance. the energy. and the radius to go around an obstacle in the middle of the path. and they stopped it at the other end within 1 centimeter of the finish line. This is an eighthgrade student that did this. helping his class win the first place. I think Dillon Sneads mathematic abilities are tremendous. I would like to congratulate him. Mr. Speaker. I want to finally take this opportunity to congratulate all the coaches and members of this years Science Olympiad team from School District 56s Bell Street Middle School on their 13th consecutive State championship. I will try to read their names without stumbling. If I do. students. I apologize: Sydney Argoe. Victor Barcenas. Jordan Barker. Sean Bell. Jonathan Braswell. Sienna Brent. Jakiya Campbell. Erin Caughman. Justin Easter. Mason Gibbs. Cole Gresham. Karl Gustafson. Anjela Gutierrez. Grace Johnson. Matthew Lane. Dequan Lindsay. Patrick Nelson. Toni Parenti. Jakob Pountain. Tytajha Robinson. Alyssa Shiflet. Dillon Snead. Destiny Spoone. Bailey Stephens. Maren Vondergeest. Nathan Vondergeest. Gary Walsh. Caitlyn Watson. David Wilkie. and Kari Young. These are all the students on that team. Mr. Speaker. and while I dont have all the names of their parents and the teachers. I want to congratulate them as well and thank them for their efforts in helping create our future scientists and innovators. and for challenging these middle school students to be the very best they can be. You see. these things dont happen overnight. These Science Olympiad teams train weekend after weekend. spending Saturdays and sometimes Sunday afternoons with the teachers and the parents involved. figuring all these mathematic formulas out and figuring out this science. I also want to wish the best of luck to all of you as you make your way to Lincoln. Nebraska. for the national competition. which is in May. I would like to end by saying: May God continue to bless these students. their teachers. and their parents. may God put a hedge of protection over them as they travel. may God continue to bless Bell Street Middle School. and may God continue to bless the United States of America."
1140023711,Mr. Chair. before I start. I just want to thank the gentleman from Idaho. the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development. and Related Agencies appropriations for all his exemplary work on this and allowing the open process to actually work. I know that my colleagues that have offered amendments appreciate the time that they have been able to do that. and I want to thank him for that. Mr. Chair. I rise today to offer an amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. This amendment takes dollars out of the bureaucracy in Washington. D.C.. and puts it to work for the American people. helping ports and harbors like the Charleston Port in my home State of South Carolina do the important work necessary to begin the deepening of those harbors. Last month. I had the pleasure of visiting the Panama Canal when I led a House delegation to the Summit of the Americas. The lock and dam system in that canal is being upgraded. and it was very interesting to see the work that they are doing there. Once that work is complete. larger ships will be able to come through the canal and deliver goods to and from Atlantic and Gulf ports along the eastern seaboard. This will be one of the key economic drivers in the 21st century. If America is going to compete on the global stage. we need to be ready for this transformation. My amendment seeks to speed that readiness. helping to transform critical ports like Charlestons to the depth that will allow these bigger ships to navigate those harbors more often. This amendment is about this House setting our governments spending priorities. just like every family does at home. We are rapidly approaching a $20 trillion debt. and we have a moral responsibility to use every tax dollar wisely. I am grateful that my colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations were able to negotiate this amendment to increase funding for vital infrastructure projects like the Port of Charleston and pay for it by forcing bureaucratic agencies to operate more efficiently. I urge the passage of the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina .
1140029587,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the chairman of the committee. I rise today in support of H.R. 1335. the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act. I want to thank my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee for including my amendment in support of the findings of the MorrisDeal Commission. One of the top priorities of the MorrisDeal Commission was requiring a review. and adjustment if warranted. of the allocations of mixedsector fisheries. Despite the tremendous importance that allocation decisions have in maximizing the benefits that our fisheries provide to the Nation. Federal fisheries managers have refused to revisit allocationsmost of which were determined decades agoprimarily because of a lack of clear guidance on how decisions should be made and because these decisions are inherently difficult. My amendment included in the committee text would prompt the development of criteria that should be considered in allocation decisions and require periodic allocation reviews. The language does not prescribe any specific shifts in existing allocations but rather a sciencebased review and potential adjustment if needed. Recognizing the high number of important recreational fisheries in the region. the geographic scope of this provision is limited to just the South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. You see the poster beside me. As vice chairman of the Congressional Sportsmens Caucus. I represent 1.3 million anglers in the organizations on this poster that they belong to that support this bill. Let us be clear: the goal here is to allow more fishermen. whether they are commercial fishermen or recreational anglers. to be able to take more fish in a responsible manner. We want policy based on sound science compatible with the facts in the water. not the uninformed opinions of an agendadriven desk jockey bureaucrat in Washington. D.C. This provision was in the MSA reauthorization bills introduced by Senators RUnIO and Begich in the 113th Congress. Again. I want to thank my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee for helping include this language. and I urge passage of the final bill. This is common sense to reauthorize MagnusonStevens. The gentleman from Alaska has done a tremendous job on this. and I urge passage.
1140063779,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman. I thank him for having this Peoples Night 2. so as to take the opportunity to speak to the American people about. really. what have become a lot of frustrations since they elected a Republican House and a Republican Senate. In fact. I did a teletownhall last night. and a number of comments and questions that I had was: Why cant you guys get more bills to the Presidents desk? I had to explain that there is a 60vote filibuster. the modern filibustera 60vote thresholdover in the Senate. I had to explain what a modern filibuster rule is in the Senate. A Senator from the great State of South Carolina actually filibustered on the floor. He spoke for 48 hours without stopping. without sitting down. He held the floor of the Senate to make a point for 48 hours. That is the traditional filibuster that you hear about. Today. in the 21st century. when we hear that a Senator has filed a filibuster and that there is a 60vote threshold to get over. what that means is a Senator has just put his name on a bill. and he doesnt have to go down and utter a single word. and he doesnt have to stand on the floor for a single minute. In fact. he can go to Charlie Palmers and have a steak and call it a ""filibuster."" America. this is wrong. I had a conversation with some Senate staff today because I think they ought to change their Senate rules. They said: Well. the Senatorand he is a Senator I respect a lotdisagrees with your position. They pointed out that the Senate filibuster rule. the 60vote threshold. has helped Republicans in the past to stop bad legislation. They said it stopped amnesty. I said: Well. hold on right there. Amnesty. actually. passed. The Gang of Eight bill passed. and we failed to bring it up in the House. We stopped it on the House side. They said: Well. it stopped gun control and a lot of other things. I said: Yes. but it is keeping right now a lot of good things from making it to the Presidents desk. America gave us this majority. and they really expect us to pass bills out that reflect the Republican principles. morals. values. and convictions of the electorate that sent us here and gave us this majority. They expect us to pass bills out of the Congress and to send them to the Presidents desk. Then the President can do whatever he wants with those bills. but I think. if he vetoes them. then America will see the dichotomy between the Republican governance and a Democrat President. Now the Senate rules. They are not in this book. This is the United States Constitution. It is a pocket copy that I carry with me. You cant find the Senate rules in this. It does say that both bodiesthe House and the Senatemake their own rules to govern what goes on here. but they are not spelled out in this document. It is time for MITCH MCCONNELL and the Republicans over in the Senate to actually have a ""come to Jesus"" meeting and really talk about what is stifling the Republican work when the Republican electorate in this country has given us the majority and expects us to do the work. I want to shift gears for just a minute because this is the Peoples Night. and I want to talk about something that is on the minds of the American peoplethe safety and security of our Nation and the national security issues in the wake of the Paris attacks. in the wake of the Lebanon bombing. in the wake of a lot of things that we are seeing with stabbings and other things that are going on by ISIS. primarily. but you can throw Boko Haram and some others who are committing acts of terror into the mix as well. Americans are concerned about the safety and security of our Nation. I chair the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Just this afternoon. it was revealed that the Honduran police stopped five Syrians who were carrying falsified Greek passports. and they had flown all over Latin America before they had gotten to Honduras. They were headed north to the Guatemalan border. If they were headed north to the Guatemalan border. it tells me they were going to take advantage of our porous southern border. like many others have. to enter into this country. We dont know why. What we do know is five Syrians traveled to Honduras on fake Greek passports. and they were apprehended by the police. People are criticizing the Republicans for wanting to hit ""pause"" on the Syrian refugee program. and they are saying. ""You dont have compassion."" Let me tell you that you dont lock the door because you hate the people on the outside. You lock the door because you love the people on the inside. We have to protect America. That is what we are charged to do. When we raise our hands and swear an oath to the Constitutionto uphold it and to defend this great countrywe are charged as Members of Congress to protect this great Nation. first and foremost. I thank the gentleman for some leniency. I will continue to speak on behalf of the American people. It is time for MITCH to get moving on some bills that are Republican bills over in the Senate."
1140065143,Mr. Speaker. I wish President Obama took the threat of radical Islamic jihadists as seriously as he takes the pseudo science behind the manmade climate change threat. Folks. these EPA rules affect jobs and they affect the amount of money in the pockets of moms and dads all across this great country. Now. transportation fuel costs are down for moms and dads. but the power to heat and cool their homes. the power to run the engines of the economythe cost of that power has gone up because of the EPA regulations and rule writing that we have seen. What does that mean? Well. wholesale electricity prices in South Carolina will spike as high as 13.9 percent. Households will pay as much as $84.19 more a year. Industrial customers will pay as much as $40.200 more a year just in South Carolina. It will cause 11.700 manufacturing jobs to be impacted. Since 2012. 27 coal mining companies with core operations in West Virginia have filed for bankruptcy protection. But you know what? The TPP trade deal will allow West Virginia coal and Wyoming coal to be shipped to China to be burned. Now. where is the hypocrisy in that? Let me tell you this: We rely on 24/7. always on. baseload power to run the engines of our society to heat and cool our homes. We cant do that with intermittent solar and wind. You can do that with nuclear. hydro. and fossilfuelfired power plants. Think about the morality of 24/7 baseload power. That means the incubators in the hospitals are there to provide the incubation for the preemie children. That means that you can keep food from spoiling. That means you can heat your homes with some sort of source that doesnt cause pollution inside your home like it does. say. in Latin America or Africa. where they are burning wood or coal. We have the ability through nuclear. hydro. and through fossilfuelfired power plants to provide that 24/7 baseload power. You cant do it with regulations that continue to kill the industry. You cant do it with intermittent energy sources like wind and solar. These regulations and these rules. written because of those regulations. are killing job creation in this country.
1140067449,Mr. Speaker. this legislation is a step in the right direction. The changes that I like particularly to the Visa Waiver Program are a requirement to share counterterrorism information with the United States and that all visa waiver countries must submit lost and stolen passport information to INTERPOLs database within 24 hours. In May of 2014. a foreign fighter. radicalized on the battlefield in Syria after 1 year. traveled back to Europe. He traveled through Turkey and through Germany. It is believed that Germany had information on this individual. but it failed to share that information with its neighbors France and Belgium. He arrived in Brussels. In a 90second attack with an automatic weapon on a Jewish museum. he killed 4 people before fleeing to France. making it all the way to the south of France. to the city of Marseille. where he hoped to cross the Mediterranean and disappear into the African continent. Why do I tell you this story? It is because of the freedom of travel in the Schengen region. or the open borders region in Europe. the radicalization of foreign fighters joining ISIS on the battlefield and having the ability to travel back to Europe and possibly. being undetected. travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program if the countries dont share the information. In addition. in the last 30 days. we have seen numerous instances where stolen or fraudulent passports have been used by migrants and terrorists to travel throughout Europe as well as across Latin America. Just recently. five Syrians traveled through the triborder region. which is Argentina. Brazil. and Paraguay. It is a region in the northern area of Argentina. They traveled there from Syria on stolen Israeli passports. and then they purchased. in the triborder region. Greek passports and were able to transit Latin America into Honduras. where they were stopped with those false passports. These are real examples of real issues. and it is why I support what we are trying to do today.
1140078801,"I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership on this issue. We both are on the Committee on Homeland Security. so we are acutely aware of some of the terrorist dangers that are out there because we hear it in a lot of committee meetings. classified briefings. and other things. Mr. Speaker. it is time that Congress act proactively against a President who holds a personal legacy above the law. Law does not bend to legacy. Law is obeyed. respected. and even honored for the order it brings to our Nation. Disturbingly. this principle of our Founders seems to be at odds with a growing segment of politicians. That is why I introduced House Resolution 617. House Resolution 617 gives authority to the Speaker of the House to initiate litigation against any executive branch official should they file an illegal order by transferring detainees to U.S. soil. This commonsense approach provides a constitutional check on the President. Now. whether in Charleston. Colorado. or Kansas. he should not bring American families. neighbors. and communities into close proximity with some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world. Unfortunately. the President has forgotten about the people. He has forgotten that they dont travel in armored motorcades. They have no security details guarding their every step. looking around every corner. I know my constituents are fearful of this proposal by the President because the folks in Charleston. South Carolina. have been fearful. The Navy brig the President is proposing to bring these terrorists to is a very. very short distance from an elementary school. I would also call on the candidates for President of the United States when they are campaigning around South Carolina. ask them a question: Do they support housing terrorists in our neighborhoodsthat is a legitimate questionnear our children who are at schools or near our churches where we worship? Mr. Speaker. the language that prevents transferring detainees to U.S. soil was actually put in by a Democratic Congress and passed in bipartisan fashion ever since. It was further reaffirmed in last years NDAA. It is against the law for the President to transfer detaineesI am going to stop using the word ""detainees""-terrorists. It is against the law for a President of the United States to transfer terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the United States. to our soil. [ 1915 That is in the law. It has been in the law since the Democrats controlled this body. We just reaffirmed it this year. This isnt a Republican or Democratic issue. It is bipartisan. It is against the law. Now. I visited GTMO. When I was a freshman in Congress 5 years ago. I went down there to see it for myself. Some of the biggest names on the terrorist roster are located there due to the brave efforts of our men and women in combat to capture these guys on the battlefield. We have released a lot of them. Thirty percent. as you heard the gentleman from Texas say. of the terrorists that we have released have returned to terrorism or we suspect they have return to terrorism. That is based on intel. Thirty percent is a large number of the number that we have released. Whether it is South Carolina. Colorado. Kansas. or any other State. no State should be a terrorist dumping ground for this administration. So lets follow the law. Lets follow the law passed in a bipartisan manner through the United States Congress. Lets force the President to follow the law. Because. if he doesnt. lets pass H.R. 1617 and give the Speaker of the House the legal grounds and the authority to file a lawsuit to put an injunction in place to keep him from violating the law. violating a law. by the way. that he signed."
1140086056,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of S. 1638. Mr. Speaker. since construction began in 2006. the Department of Homeland Securitys consolidated headquarters on St. Elizabeths historic Washington. D.C. campus has been riddled with cost overruns and construction delays. at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. As the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency. I conducted rigorous oversight of the project. including holding a hearing in September 2014. Having visited the site. I saw firsthand the immense challenges that lie ahead. While we are encouraged by the recently updated DHS St. Elizabeths plan. we still believe that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the efficient use of taxpayer dollars. especially considering this project was fully funded through the fiscal year 2016 appropriations. and DHS alone has requested $225 million for fiscal year This bill that we are talking about today. the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act. a companion to H.R. 1640. which was passed by the House unanimously in June of last year and of which I was a cosponsor. will require the Secretary of Homeland Security. in coordination with the administrator of General Services. to submit a report on the implementation of the updated plan for the headquarters consolidation. including estimated costs and occupancy plans of the project. With a project of this magnitude. improved oversight and increased transparency is paramount. Mr. Speaker. Thomas Jefferson once said that an educated citizenry is ""the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty."" Our constituents expect their representatives to hold government accountable. S. 1638 does just that. I wish to thank Senators JOHNSON and CARPER for their hard work passing this bill through the Senate. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important bipartisan legislation. I reserve the balance of my time."

1140014852,"Mr. President. today I want to comment on the recent election in Israel and the Obama administrations outrageous reaction to it. Two days ago Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahus Likud Party won a decisive victory in the Israel election. For myself and on behalf of 3 million Arkansans. I want to offer hearty congratulations to Prime Minister Netanyahu. I have the greatest admiration for the Prime Ministers visionary and courageous statesmanship. as well as his service as a young man in his countrys elite special operations forces. Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family have paid the highest price over the decades in the fight against the common enemies of Israel and the United States. Yet let me also stress that the alliance between the United States and Israel is not an alliance for this or that Israeli statesman nor this or that Israeli political party. Nor. for that matter. does the alliance depend on whom or which party controls the White House or the Congress. Rather. it is an alliance between the American people and the Israeli people. between the ultimate defender of the West and the easternmost frontier of the West. Our alliance rests on our shared experiences and principles: our JudeoChristian heritage. respect for the natural rights of mankind. democratic selfgovernment. marketbased economics. and strong provision for our common defense. Israels commitment to democratic elections demonstrated just this week an important distinction from many of their neighbors and why they are our closest ally in the region. Apparently. President Obama harbors such deepseated and irrational antipathy for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he is now willing to upend this decadeslong alliance. President Obamas antagonism toward Prime Minister Netanyahu is longstanding and well known. Last year. for example. anonymous administration officials used a vulgar epithet to question Prime Minister Netanyahus courage. I will point out. as an aside. that anonymity is the Washington cowards shield. just as I am also compelled to point out that. so far as I know. neither the President nor his senior political aides served in our countrys elite special operations forces. unlike Prime Minister Netanyahu. Back to my main point. in the last 48 hours. more anonymous administration officials have suggested a fundamental rethinking of the United StatesIsrael alliance. citing Prime Minister Netanyahus simple restatement of fact that there can be no Palestinian State until conditions change. The Palestinian Authority must. at a minimum. eject Hamas from its governing coalition. reclaim control of the Gaza Strip. accept a demilitarized eastern border in Judea and Samaria. and recognize Israels right to exist as a Jewish State. As Prime Minister Netanyahu has said. if the Palestinians lay down their arms. there will be peace. But if Israel lays down its arms. there will be no Israel. The Obama administration. though. has gone off the deep end and let their personal bitterness towards the Israeli Prime Minister drive their public foreign policy toward our closest ally. Here are just a few quotes from administration officials suggesting a fundamental change in our relationship with Israel and a willingness to abandon Israel at the United Nations. One official said: ""We are signaling that [if the Israeli governments position is no longer to pursue a Palestinian state.] were going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going forward."" According to reports. that same official ""wouldnt rule out a modified American posture at the United Nations. where the U.S. has long fended off resolutions criticizing Israeli settlement activity and demanding its withdrawal from Palestinian territories."" Another senior White House official said: The premise of our position internationally has been to support direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We are now in a reality where the Israeli government no longer supports direct negotiations. Therefore we clearly have to factor that into our decisions going forward. Finally. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: Were currently evaluating our approach. Were not going to prejudge what we would do if there was a UN action. Some observers will dismiss these comments as the petulant response of a President and political operatives who didnt get their way in the elections this week. But there is something much more worrisome underway. While Prime Minister Netanyahu won a decisive victory. he still has just started assembling a governing majority coalition. These kinds of quotes from Israels most important ally could very well startle some of the smaller parties and their leaders with whom Prime Minister Netanyahu is currently in negotiations. This raises the question. of course. if the administration intends to undermine Prime Minister Netanyahus efforts to assemble a coalition by suggesting a change to our longstanding policy of supporting Israels position with the United Nations. After all. if you were an elected leader in Israels parliament. you surely would worry about the United States refusing to exercise its veto at the U.N. Security Council. Consider the United Nations long and dark history of antiSemitism. The U.N. Human Rights Council has condemned Israel in 45 resolutions since its creation in 2006. In 2013. the U.N. General Assembly adopted a total of 21 resolutions singling out Israel for disapproval and just 4 resolutions for the rest of the world. Fifty percent of all emergency special sessions of the General Assembly over the last six decades were convened to denounce Israel. Meanwhile. no emergency special session has been called for any other state in over 30 years. Given this history and the stakes here and abroad. let me speak bluntly so there can be no misunderstanding. Under no circumstances will I or this Congress allow the Obama administration to abandon Israel to the United Nations or any other international institution or to change fundamentally the terms of our alliance with Israel. This administrations latest outrageous pronouncement is even more difficult to understand as they simultaneously coddle the terrorist regime in Iran. The people of Israel should know the American people remain in solidarity with them in their quest to exist peacefully with their neighbors and that we will not allow them to be thrown to the jackals at the United Nationsa characterization made famous by a past Member of this body. the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan. I call on all Members of this body. including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. to join with me in one voice supporting our ally Israel against the jackals. In the coming daysperhaps as soon as the debate over the budget resolution next weekI will propose legislation that reaffirms the longstanding policy of the United States to continue to defend Israel against attacks at the United Nations and other international agencies. I urge all Members of this body. including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have a long history of supporting Israel. to join me in supporting such legislation. Further. should the United Nations. its subordinate agencies. the International Criminal Court or any other international agency take adverse action against Israel. I will consider introducing legislation to restrict U.S. funding for the offending agency. Finally. if the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations does not exercise the American veto against any antiIsrael resolution. I will also consider introducing similar legislation to restrict funding to the Ambassadors office. For decades. the relationship between Israel and the United States has transcended political and personal differences. Our shared interests were enough to overcome any ideology or personal disagreement. but I fear mutual respect is of little concern to this administration. The President and all those senior officials around him should carefully consider the diplomatic and security consequences of their words. This Congress certainly will."
1140015141,"Madam President. this week we will debate the budget. The key part is the military budget. one part of our government where the strategy and threats must drive the budget. not vice versa. The greatest threat to our national security is a nucleararmed Iran. and this man. Ayatollah Khomeini. the Supreme Leader of Iran. Last week marked Nowruz. the beginning of the Persian New Year. On the occasion we were treated to speeches by President Obama and Irans Supreme Leader. Ayatollah Khomeini. I have to say. President Obamas speech was illadvised. He spoke to the Iranian people directly. asking them to press their leaders and speak up in support of a nuclear agreement. Lets be clear about one thing: Iranians who speak up tend to disappear into secret prisons or wind up hanging from cranes by the neck. Worse. by acting as if public opinion matters to the Ayatollahs. President Obama is treating Iran as if it were a legitimate democracy. not a brutal theocratic dictatorship. No President should legitimize such a regime. which emboldens the dictator and undermines the Iranian people struggling under his yoke. But today I want to focus on the speech of this man. Ayatollah Khomeini. the Supreme Leader of Iran. The Ayatollah gave his speech on Saturday. just 2 days ago. It may have escaped your attention. but it was not exactly a New Years message filled with blessings of hope and peace. Ayatollah Khomeini has never been a great admirer of America. of course. He sometimes likes to refer to us as the ""Great Satan."" During his Nowruz speech. he whipped the crowd into frenzied chants of ""death to America."" What was his response to that chant? He said. ""Yes. certainly. death to America."" Death to America. That was just 2 days ago. Remember. this is the leader with whom the United States is negotiating today. a theocratic tyrant who. in the middle of nuclear negotiations. chants ""death to America."" I suggest that we rethink the wisdom of granting nuclear concessions to such a man. Unfortunately. Ayatollah Khomeini may know his negotiating partners somewhat better than they know themselves. for the Ayatollah also observed. ""Irans enemies. particularly America. are moving forward with prudence and diplomacy. I understand them. They know what they are doing. They need these negotiations. America needs the nuclear negotiations."" Regrettably. he is right when he says he understands his enemies. since the West. especially the President. acts as if we need these negotiations more than Iran does. After all. we had Iran on its knees in 2013 when President Obama gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief for merely starting negotiations. The West has extended negotiations twice in exchange for nothing. The President has also made a series of onesided concessions from Irans uranium enrichment capabilities to the length of a nuclear agreement. So. yes. unfortunately. Ayatollah Khomeini is correct when he says he understands his enemies. Lets consider what he said about the negotiations in this light. This past weekend. the Ayatollah emphasized. ""We are absolutely not negotiating or holding discussions with the Americans over regional or domestic issues and neither over weapons capabilities."" Again. he is absolutely right. Iran has a ballistic missile program. which it only needs if it wants to strike the United States or our European allies. because it already has missiles capable of striking Israel or anywhere else in the Middle East. Yet we have removed its missile program from the negotiating table. just as we have removed the possible military dimensions of its nuclear program from the table. even though that is critical to understanding how far they have progressed toward a bomb. It is not just their weapons capabilities. Note that the Ayatollah also said Iran is not negotiating over regional issues. He made this point repeatedly. saying also. ""We are not negotiating with the Americans over regional issues. U.S. goals in the region are in complete contrast with our goals."" and. ""Negotiations with the U.S. are only over the nuclear issue. and nothing else. Everyone should be aware of this."" By ""regional issues"" and ""our goals."" to be clear. Ayatollah Khomeini means Irans drive for regional hegemony. The outlaw Assad regime in Syria is more beholden to Iran than ever. Iranianaligned militants have seized the capital of Yemen. causing the American Embassy to close and our troops to evacuate. Iranianbacked and Iranianled Shiite militias are slowly taking over Iraq. and Lebanon remains subject to Hezbollah. Irans terrorist proxy. Despite this multifront aggression. President Obama is compartmentalizing the nuclear negotiations as if Irans drive for hegemony and its pursuit of nuclear weapons are distinguishable and unrelated rather than springing from the regimes revolutionary nature. In fact. President Obama reportedly wrote a private letter to Ayatollah Khomeinihis fourth private letter to the Ayatollahin part reassuring him that the United States would not undermine Assads regime in Syria. Is it any wonder then that the Ayatollah boasts the negotiations are so limited? Is it any wonder what Ayatollah Khomeini said this weekend about sanctions relief? President Obama and Secretary Kerry keep insisting that sanctions can only be lifted gradually as Iran demonstrates compliance with any deal. The Ayatollah is having none of that. He said this past weekend: ""The lifting of the sanctions is part of the issues being negotiated and not the outcome of the negotiations."" In other words. in exchange for the Ayatollahs ephemeral and easily reversed promises. ""sanctions must be lifted immediately following an agreement."" That is not a splittable difference. And lets just say our sides history of onesided concessions in these negotiations does not inspire confidence that we will preserve a sanctions regime that we took decades to assemble fully. Finally. Ayatollah Khomeini wants the world to know that Iran will not be bound in perpetuity by any deal. no matter its terms. He said: ""The Americans keep saying that there should be irreversibility in the terms Iran accepts and the decisions it makes. We do not accept that."" The Ayatollah is happy to pocket concessions now for billions of dollars in sanctions relief and international legitimacy while preserving the option of going nuclear in the future. much as North Korea did after the 1994 Agreed Framework. I understand why Ayatollah Khomeini would want that deal. but why would we? This is the man with whom we are negotiating. Evil men rarely cloak their wicked intent. and I urge my fellow Senators and all Americans to pay careful attention to Ayatollah Khomeinis words both this past weekend and more generally. When someone chants. ""Yes. certainly. death to America."" we should take him at his word and we should not put him on a path to a nuclear bomb. Those words are appalling enough. Lets not give him the ability to act on them. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140020375,"Mr. President. in 1941. in an address delivered at an event in honor of the Canadian Prime Minister. Winston Churchill famously declared. ""Canada is the linchpin of the Englishspeaking world."" As with most things. Churchill was able to see deeper truths and recognize Canada for what it really is. Today. I wish to recognize the close and vital relationship between the United States and Canada. our great neighbor to the north. Canada is a critical partner to both America and Arkansas. We ought to find every way to strengthen our relationship and avoid every possible trouble on the horizon. The bond between the United States and Canada starts with our common heritage and our common way of life. including individuals rights. constitutional democracy. the rule of law. open markets. and the defense of freedom around the world. Canada has stood with the United States in our toughest hours to defend our common way of life. Canadian troops fought alongside our GIs on Dday at Juno Beach. where 1 in every 13 Canadians perished. After the 9111 attacks. Canada was one of the first countries to join our campaign in Afghanistan. where 158 brave Canadians died on the battlefieldthe rough equivalent of 1.400 American troops. As with our own soldiers. we honor their ultimate sacrifice and entrust their families to the tender care of a loving providence. Canada has also been a willing partner in many other security and humanitarian operations around the globe. including Libya. Haiti. and the NATOled stabilization force in BosniaHerzegovina in the 1990s. Moreover. Canada is part of the Five Eyes intelligence partnership. which has its roots in World War II. This partnership is vital to our national security. helping. for example. to disrupt a 2013 Al Qaedaassociated plot to derail a train traveling between New York and Canada. If successful. this attack could have killed dozens. perhaps even hundreds. Canada and the United States also share the worlds longest borderand the worlds longest peaceful border. Over 300.000 people cross our shared border every day by every mode of transport. Americans too often forget ours is the most secure and mutually beneficial international relationship among nations. taking for granted our peaceful partner to the north. Our success as the global superpower and the ability to protect our interests and global stability depends heavily on our peaceful and productive relationship with Canada. Without it. the New World would not be able to project power into the Old. Our relationship with Canada is indeed productive. as Canada has remained our best and most important trading partner. Last year. $759 billion in goods and services moved between Canada and the United States. To put that into perspective. Canada purchased more goods from the United States than did all 28 members of the European Union combined and 21/2 times more than did China. These purchases included everything from raw materials to paper produced in Ashdown. rice milled in Stuttgart. and construction hardware manufactured in Blytheville. Moreover. Canada is the largest supplier of energy to the United States. In January. in fact. the United States imported more oil from Canada than all OPEC countries combined. and Canada produces 97 percent of all U.S. natural gas imports. Of course. these numbers would be even greater if President Obama would finally approve the Keystone XL Pipeline which would also create thousands of highpaying American and Canadian jobs. Arkansas. like America as a whole. has benefited immensely from our close ties to Canada. Agricultural products. iron and steel produced in Arkansas factories. and countless other products manufactured in the natural state find their way to our friends in the north. providing Arkansans with good customers and good jobs. Indeed. Canada is Arkansas No. 1 foreign customer and 66.000 Arkansas jobs depend on United StatesCanada trade and investment. which totals $2.3 billion every year. Some of Arkansas most recognizable names reflect these ArkansasCanada ties. Murphy Oil. headquartered in El Dorado. has operated in Canada for over 60 years. producing oil and natural gas through stakes in several projects off the coast of Newfoundland and in Alberta and British Columbia. Walmart has also had a strong presence in Canada for over 20 years. Today. they employ over 90.000 Canadians across nearly 400 retail stores. Tyson and Skippy Peanut Butter are just two of the household names produced in Arkansas that are pantry staples in Canada. With agricultural products making up nearly 20 percent of Arkansas exports to Canada. Arkansas ranchers and farmers help round out Canadas pantries and freezers. Given these warm. longstanding ties to Canada. my team and I have worked closely with the Canadian Embassy during my time in Congress to promote and strengthen our relationship. Unfortunately. the Obama administration at times has impeded it. The Keystone Pipeline. for instance. is not just good for American jobs but also a critical project for Canadas economy. Yet President Obama dismissed it as mere Canadian oil from Canadian companiescavalier comments that minimize the pipelines benefits for American workers. while also manifesting a casual disregard for our close allys interests. Now we are seeing this neglect again with countryoforigin labeling requirements for meat products processed in the United States which threaten to disrupt trade between our two countries. These socalled COOL regulations needlessly require different labeling for products born. raised or slaughtered in either country. Today. processors are forced to either operate two production lines to keep their Canadianborn or raised cattle separate from those born and raised in the United States or maintain extensive records on where each head of cattle came from. These regulations unduly burden Canadian producers and American processors while also violating our treaty obligations. Yet they deliver little value to consumers. Yet. despite multiple adverse rulings from the World Trade Organization. the administration continues to pursue appeals. a process which is expected to end next month. As a result of these trade barriers and WTO rulings. Canada may be forced to impose reciprocal trade barriers on American products. Unfortunately. products already targeted for trade barriers include Arkansas rice. poultry. grains. and beef. If the administration does not relent. nearly $130 million in Arkansas agricultural trade with Canada will be threatenedmore than half our States annual total. We should put a stop now to this trade dispute that no one intended and no one wants. I stand ready to work with my fellow Senators and the administration to modify the labeling requirements at the earliest opportunity following a final WTO ruling. It will be good for Arkansas farmers and ranchers. good for American consumers. and good for the health of the United StatesCanada partnership. Lets work together to fix this problem. protect American jobs. and help our neighbor to the north remain our linchpin in the world."
1140024353,"Fellow Members. today I recognize a distinguished American hero. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hite of Camden. AK. who died last month at the age of 95. Just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. on December 7. 1941. a group of courageous young pilots flew Army Air Forces bombers off the deck of the USS Hornet in the Pacific Ocean to carry out a dangerous. lowaltitude bombing attack on Japans home islands. The Doolittle Raid provided an enormous morale boost for Americans with a crushing blow to the imperial regime in Tokyo. Among these brave men was an Arkansan. Colonel Robert L. Hite. Colonel Hite had enlisted as an aviation cadet on September 9. 1940. He was later commissioned as a second lieutenant and rated as a pilot on May 29. 1941. Almost bumped from the mission because of space limitations. Colonel Hite was assigned as a copilot ultimately to the B25 ""Bat Out of Hell."" He rejected his fellow airmens attempts to buy his spot on the plane and launched his mission on April 19. 1942. Lieutenant Colonel Hites aircraft successfully carried out a lowlevel bombing run on an aircraft factory and fuel depot in Nagoya. Japan. but inclement weather forced the crew to bail out over Japanesecontrolled territory as their plane ran low on fuel. Lieutenant Colonel Hite landed in a Japanese rice paddy field. where he was captured and sentenced to execution. Lieutenant Colonel Hite served 40 months in a Japanese prison38 of them in solitary confinementwhere he was tortured and endured brutal conditions. Following VJ Day. Lieutenant Colonel Hite was freed on August 20. 1945. He returned home and married his first wife Portia 1 year later. Lieutenant Colonel Hite later returned to active service. training pilots overseas during the Korean war from 1951 to 1955. After leaving Active Duty. he and Portia moved home to Camden. AR. where he managed the Camden Hotel until 1965. Lieutenant Colonel Hite was widowed in 1999 and later married his late wife. Dorothy. Lieutenant Colonel Hite is survived by two children. five grandchildren. seven greatgrandchildren. and two greatgreatgrandchildren. On April 18. just 2 weeks after his death. and the 73rd anniversary of the Doolittle Raid. Lieutenant Colonel Hite and his fellow soldiers were posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor. Arkansans young and old and all Americans can appreciate Lieutenant Colonel Hites service to his family. his community. and his Nationa fine example for us all to emulate. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140051332,"Madam President. over the last year I have learned a lot about the magic of human lifefrom conception to growth in the mothers womb. to childbirth. to newborn development. This wasnt a part of my legislative work or my public duties. My newfound knowledge didnt come from a course of study reading scientific journals or consulting with medical experts. instead. like many parents. I learned through experience the blessings of my first child. My wife Anna gave birth to our very own little angel Gabriel almost 5 months ago. Since then. Gabriel has joined me on this very floor. at this very desk. Many of you have met our little man and happily agree that he appears to take after his mother. Gabriel has been a part of our family from the beginning. long before he was born. I remember when Anna and I first discovered she was pregnant. We were so excited. yet like so many new parents. also apprehensive for his health and safety. Then 1 year ago this week. we had our first appointment with the OBGYN in Russellville. We couldnt believe it when we heard his little heartbeat on the ultrasound at barely 9 weeks. Anna recalls that she almost started crying. though I dont recall an ""almost"" for either one of us. Just 4 weeks later. as the first trimester concluded. we got one of those perfect ultrasound shots. We saw Gabriel in profile lying on his back. hands near his face. feet and legs kicked up in the air. We now know how much of his personality and habits he had already developed by that point because that position is how we usually find him when he wakes from his nap. Soon after. he began to flip around. kick and hiccup. which he also likes to do to this day. All of these things happened before the halfway point in Annas pregnancy. before Gabriel reached 20 weeks. While he is precious and one of a kind for us. it is quite normal for a typical baby. as expecting parents can tell you and as modern medical science can now document. While Anna carried Gabriel to term and he was born happy and healthy. many babies arent as lucky. but thanks to the miracle of medical science. babies age just 20 weeks after fertilization can increasingly survive if born at that extremely premature age. A remarkable study published earlier this year in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that babies age 20 to 22 weeks can survive with skilled and proper. though not extraordinary. medical intervention and treatment. Likewise. advances in perinatology have made fetal surgery more common and successful. sometimes as early as 16 weeks. These breakthroughs can help correct or ameliorate certain fetal conditions. Not only can 20weekold babies survive outside of the womb. but they can also undergo successful surgery inside the womb. It is common practice in these surgeries to administer anesthesia. not just to the mother but specifically to the baby in utero to prevent both from feeling pain. In other words. medical science increasingly confirms the common experience of parents and the religious and ethical belief of the ages that an unborn baby is just as much a person as you. as I. as each of us. only more innocent. more helpless and therefore even more deserving of protection. especially by the halfway point of the pregnancy. They feel pain and they seek life. It is particularly heartbreaking that such babies are killed in our country. By some estimates. 10.000 babies 20 weeks or older are aborted each year. By this point most Americans have seen the gruesome videos of Planned Parenthood officials callously discussing the dismemberment of babies to harvest and sell their organs. They cavalierly talk about using ""less crunchy procedures"" to preserve the organs. subjecting the baby to excruciating pain and death for profit. This is a sad reality in America today. Just 2 miles from where I stand. just 5 blocks from the White House is an abortionist who advertises on his Web site for abortions without restriction up to 26 weeksright up to the third trimester. It is far past the medically accepted point of viability. Who knows how many other abortionists do the same. just more discreetly. It is past time to end this barbaric practice and protect these innocent babies. Therefore. I strongly support the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act and urge my fellow Senators to do the same. This legislation would stop the abortion of babies 20 weeks or older. with certain reasonable and widely supported exceptions. I understand that abortion provokes strong feelings on both sides of the question. I acknowledge that reasonable people of good will disagree about the wisdom and morality of early firstterm abortions. but I am mystified as to why we cannot come together and agree to protect babies who feel pain and who can survive outside of the womb. It is not just I and large majorities of the American people who feel this way. the civilized world overwhelmingly rejects this kind of lateterm abortion. Only seven countries allow elective abortion after 20 weeks. including Communist dictatorships like China and North Korea. which also inflict enforced abortion and sterilization on their people. By contrast. countries to our left. like France and Germany. heavily restrict or ban abortion after the first trimester and so does Belgium. home of the European Union. Even Russia bans elective abortion after the first trimester. Our abortion policy is one case where we should be ashamed of our international isolation and follow Europes lead in protecting innocent life. In our country. founded as it is on the equal rights of mankind and the unalienable right of life. it is deeply disappointing that the laws dont protect those most innocent lives among us. particularly when medical science now has the ability to do so. These scientific advances. like life itself. are miracles. These days it may seem like a miracle when a law passes around here. If that is the case. as a father. as an American. as a lawmaker. I think a miracle is called for now if it ever was."
1140061618,"Mr. President. today I wish to speak about our vote on the waters of the United States and the Environmental Protection Agency. I noted that the White House has lately been advocating for criminal justice reform. They say an underlying problem with the justice system today is that Congress criminalized too much conduct too severely. But it is the same White House that is behind the new waters of the United States regulationan Executive power grab that would effectively put every landowner in Arkansas and in America at risk of Federal criminal charges for making adjustments to land on their own private property. The waters of the United States regulation gives the government jurisdictionand. in turn. the danger of Federal criminal chargesover tributaries. adjacent waters. and ""other waters."" This includes streams that only exist after heavy rains or. as some of us call them. mud puddles. If a landowner in Arkansas has so much as a ditch on his or her property. he or she could be liable for Federal criminal charges for disturbing that ditch in any way. If a homeowner wants to add an addition to his garage and this addition even touches ""land that fills with water after rain."" also known as just ""land."" this homeowner could be liable for Federal criminal charges. President Obama and my Democratic colleagues argue that we are exaggerating: Come on. they say. the Environmental Protection Agency would never bring charges against a homeowner for expanding his garage or trying to regulate a mud puddle. They insist on the benevolence of the EPA and ask us to trust them to exercise good judgment and reasonable discretion. Before we trust the EPAs benevolence. though. it is prudent to examine the EPAs own track record. Lets consider that in August of this year. the EPA directed contractors to excavate the Gold King Mine in Colorado without first testing the water pressure or calculating water volume. In the worst environmental disaster in recent years. the EPA caused more than 3 million tons of toxic wastewater to pollute the Animas River. Since the spill. much of the toxicity remains. endangering farmers. landowners. Native Americans. and anyone who relies on this river. After the spill. the EPA has refused to turn over documents. disciplined no one. failed to show up to congressional hearings. refused to take responsibility. and still wont answer the simple question of whether the Agency will pay for the damages it caused. The Navajo Nation in New Mexico relies on the river polluted by the EPA for drinking water and for farming. In the days following the spill. the Navajo lost their water supply. The EPA offered to deliver clean water that the Navajo could use for drinking and crop irrigation but. instead. they used dirty oil tankers to deliver contaminated water. The EPA is not only a threat to citizens. to landowners. and to businesses. but it is also a threat to the environment they purport to protect. Since the disaster. the EPA has continued to spill toxic wastewater into creeks and rivers. There has been zero accountability for this Agency. Based on that track record. I dont think we should be giving the EPA any more power. That is why I joined my colleagues earlier today to vote to roll back the waters of the United States regulation before the EPA criminalizes nearly every landowner in the United States. But we should also consider the bigger picture. This regulation is a symptom. not the problem. The problem is the EPA itselfits overreach and lack of accountability. That is why we must pass the EPA Accountability Act. This legislation would require the EPA to payout of its own budgetfor the damages it recklessly caused when spilling 3 million gallons of toxic waste into the Animas River. Unless the EPA faces consequences for its actions against the American people. nothing will change. It is our constitutional responsibility to provide oversight of an agency that has caused massive damage to both the American people and to the environment. We must protect Arkansans and Americans from EPA overreach and lack of accountability. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140077407,Mr. President. reserving the right to object. first. I want to express my appreciation for the work Senator GRASSLEY. Senator WHITEHOUSE. and others have done in crafting the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. I agree with my colleaguesthe bill improves the way we handle juvenile offenders. The bill properly focuses on rehabilitation and services that seek to turn juveniles away from crime and provide help to atrisk youth. I support the vast majority of the bill. and I hope it ultimately passes into law. However. I would like to take more time to discuss one specific provision of the bill relating to juvenile status offenders and secure confinement. Secure confinement is not and in my opinion should not be the preferred option for instances of alcohol possession. truancy. or other status offenses. In fact. current law bars judges from imposing secure confinement for initial status offenses. But I am concerned that the bill eliminates completely the ability for judges to order secure confinement for a short time in instances where a status offender flagrantly violates the judges prior order for him to. say. enter into rehabilitation. counseling. or take part in other treatment services. In such narrow circumstances. it may be prudent to allow judgesoften in consultation with the parents and attorneys involvedto have secure confinement as a means to enforce their own orders and to ensure that the juvenile receives the help he needs. Currently. many States are developing an array of options for treating status offenders beyond secure confinement. Yet a majority of States do. in fact. still choose to retain the option for judges to order secure confinement in narrow circumstances. Just last year. my State of Arkansas passed a new juvenile justice bill that sought to expand rehabilitation services for status offenders so the State could reduce the number who were subject to secure confinement. but in my State legislatures judgment. it chose to retain secure confinement as a lastresort option. I dont believe Congress should secondguess this choice. I have heard from Arkansans on this point. and I have raised it with the bills sponsors. A blanket Federal mandate that bans secure confinement in each and every circumstance may not be the best way forward. I submit we should continue to entrust States with the decision to retain it as a lastresort option and to allow judges on a casebycase basis to use their discretion about the best course to enforce their prior orders. Therefore. with hopes we can resolve the issue promptly and pass this legislation. I regretfully object.
1140096525,Mr. President. it is an honor to serve in the Senate. It is an honor to serve the people of Arkansas. I would never complain about the tasks we are given. There is one small burden I bear. though. As a junior Senator. I preside over the SenateI usually do it in the morningswhich means I am forced to listen to the bitter. vulgar. incoherent ramblings of the minority leader. Normally. like every other American. I ignore them. I cant ignore them today. however. The minority leader came to the floor. grinding the Senate to a halt all week long. saying that we havent had time to read this Defense bill. that it was written in the dead of night. We just had a vote that passed 98 to 0. It could have passed unanimously 2 days ago. Lets examine these claims that we havent had time to read it98 to 0and in committee. all the Democrats on the Armed Services Committee voted in favor of it. When was the last time the minority leader read a bill? It was probably an electricity bill. What about the claims that it was written in the dark of night? It has been public for weeks. And this. coming from a man who drafted ObamaCare in his office and rammed it through this Senate at midnight on Christmas Eve on a straight partyline vote? To say that the Senator from Arizona wrote this in the dead of night. slipped in all kinds of provisions. that people dont have time to read it. that is an outrageous slander. And to say he cares for the troops. how about this Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden troop and his son and his father and his grandfatherfour generations of service. to include almost 6 years of rotting in a prisoner of war camp. To say he is delaying this because he cares for the troops. a man who never served himself. a man who. in April of 2007. came to this very floor. before the surge had even reached its peak. and said the war was lost when over 100 Americans were being killed in Iraq every month. when I was carrying their dead bodies off an airplane at Dover Air Force Baseit is an outrage to say we had to delay this because he cares for the troops. We are delaying it for one reason and one reason only: to protect his own sad. sorry legacy. He now complains in the mornings that the Senate is not in session enough. that our calendar is too short. Whatever you think about that. the happy byproduct of fewer days in session in the Senate is that this institution will be cursed less with his cancerous leadership. I yield the floor.
1140101945,"Mr. President. I would like to recognize Marion Fletcher of Hot Springs. AR. as this weeks Arkansan of the Week. for 53 years of service to agriculture education in Arkansas. Marion recently retired. and I would like to take a few moments to recognize his legacy and his impact. Arkansas is a rural State. and for Arkansans agriculture isnt just an industry. It is a way of life. Over the last five decades. Marion has been a fixture in the Arkansas agriculture community. serving in dozens of roles in countless organizations. impacting every person he met. To say he is passionate about agriculture education is an understatement. Since 1997. Marion worked as the State supervisor and program manager of agricultural education at the Arkansas Department of Workforce Education. and before that he spent 30 years in numerous roles with the Arkansas Department of Education. Vocational and Technical Education Division. He also had a 3year stint as an ag instructor at Desha Central Schools. Locally. he has been a dedicated board member of the Garland County Farm Bureau for over 30 years. But Marions service isnt just limited to Arkansas. He has also played an important role in the National FFA. where he has been a member of the board of directors. served as national treasurer. and has been a part of various task and action force committees. To quote longtime friend Keith Stokes. ""there is not a young person who went through the FFA program that was not influenced in a positive way by Mr. Fletcher."" His hard work hasnt gone unnoticed. and he was honored with the firstever National FFA Advisors Golden Owl Award. He has also received the FFA VIP Award. recognition in the Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame. Arkansass ""service to citizens"" award. and a litany of others on a long list of welldeserved commendations. The honors. distinctions. and accolades earned by Marion are endless. Like those before me. I am proud to honor Marions work and legacy. He is an outstanding Arkansan. and our State agriculture industry is better because he committed his life to agriculture education. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."

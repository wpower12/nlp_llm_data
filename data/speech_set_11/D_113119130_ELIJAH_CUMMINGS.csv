1130005427,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also take this moment to thank the Congressional Black Caucus for making this happen. And I thank Representatives HORSFORD and JEFFRIES for leading this. It is quite encouragingand I know that our chairman. MARCIA FUDGE. agrees with mewhen we see our new Members come to the forefront and lead. Thats why our constituents sent us here. I just want you to know that we are very. very. very proud of you. as we are of our other new Member. Mr. PAYNE. who just spoke. We are certainly glad that you are here and leading. We all know our Nations disgraceful history in this area of voting rights. Ive often said that if we did not have the Voting Rights Act. these past few years have taught us that we would have to invent it. For decades and decades. racist and exclusionary voting practices kept minorities from accessing the ballot box. Im reminded of my greatgreatgrandfather. Mr. Scipio Rhame. In the South Carolina of 1868. he overcame tremendous hardships and life -threatening dangers just to register to vote. only a few years after he had come out of slavery. Sadly. this country has witnessed very slow progress toward equality in voting. The reality is that in the year 2013. we are still fighting for the right to vote for all Americans. In election after election. discriminatory voting laws and exclusionary practices still surface. This past election cycle. we saw a new wave of efforts to suppress the vote. We saw racially motivated efforts to cut back on early voting. We saw physical destruction of voter registration forms. Across the country. we saw eligible voters prevented from casting their ballots because of long lines. inaccurate voter records. and poorly trained poll workers. As the ranking member on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I launched an investigation last year into the actions of True the Vote. a Tea Party organization that claims to promote ""voter integrity"" efforts. In fact. True the Vote sought to make it harder for Americans to vote. They challenged the registration of thousands of legitimate voters across the country before Election Day. and they deployed volunteers across the country to challenge access to the polls for legitimate voters. Efforts by groups like True the Vote disproportionately affect minority communities. and they are just one small example of the practices that still seek to suppress the vote in our country. The Voting Rights Act is often cited as the most effective civil rights law in our history. Section 5 has been one of the most powerful tools in the act because it combats discriminatory attempts to marginalize voters before they can take root. When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1965. he said this: There were those who said smaller and more gradual measures should be tried. But they had been tried. For years and years they had been tried. and tried. and tried. and they had failed. and failed. and failed. And the time for failure is gone. So. in closing. I hope the Supreme Court Justices remember these words as they consider this most recent challenge to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Today. in the year 2013. section 5 remains as critical as ever to protecting the right to vote in the United States of America."
1130015340,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to begin by thanking Chairman ISSA for sponsoring this legislation and for making this a truly bipartisan effort. I am pleased to join the chairman in sponsoring this bill again this Congress. Also. I thank the other cosponsors of the bill. including the chairman and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Government Operations. Representatives JOHN MICA and GERRY CONNOLLY. and the chairman and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on National Security. Representatives JASON CHAFFETZ and JOHN TIERNEY. Last month. the Director of National Intelligence. James Clapper. placed cyber attacks at the top of his list of national security threats. This bill is an important step in Congress response to the cyber threat. This legislation would ensure that Federal agencies use a riskbased approach to defend against cyber attacks and protect government information from being compromised by our adversaries. It is important that the Federal Government set the example by ensuring that its own information is protected. The Department of Energy was hacked in January. and personal data for hundreds of employees was compromised. We are better than that. Mr. Speaker. and we can do better. Personal data for more than 100.000 accounts in the Thrift Savings Plan was compromised last year when a contractors computer was hacked. This bill would shift the Federal Government to a system of continuous monitoring of information systems. And just this morning. the chairman said in a hearing that we have to do more with less and we have to figure out ways to use technology so that we can efficiently and effectively do the things that we need to do. This bill goes right in that direction. which is so important. It would also streamline reporting requirements and ensure that agencies take a smart. riskbased approach to securing networks. This bill would continue to authorize the Office of Management and Budget to set Federal policy for information security. This is important because we need to hold all the agencies accountable for developing appropriate standards and living up to those very standards. OMB is the appropriate entity to be responsible for ensuring that that happens. However. nothing in this bill will prevent the Department of Homeland Security from continuing the great work it is doing to protect our Nation against potential cyber attacks. The Department has expanded its cybersecurity workforce and is working with agencies to establish continuous monitoring. This bill supports that work by making clear that agencies must take action to protect their networks. rather than just doing routine ""check the box"" reports. as Chairman ISSA just talked about. Today. we have a bipartisan effort. It is truly a bipartisan effort to address a problem that affects every single American and business. every entity of our Nation. Thats why its so good that we had all of our subcommittee rankings and chairmen working together and Mr. ISSA making sure that this legislation got out. As it is so very important. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. With that. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130042083,Mr. Chair. I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 2610. This bill. which was crafted to conform to the strangling and senseless limits of the Ryan budget. would cut the total discretionary funding for the TransportationHUD appropriations measure by $7.7 billion below the enacted fiscal year 2013 appropriation and by more than $4 billion below the level of funding provided after sequestration took effect. These cuts would devastate programs like the Community Development Block Grant program and the HOME program. which are essential to supporting development in cities throughout our Nation and to providing housing and other services to our most vulnerable citizens. This bill would also be devastating to our national passenger rail service. Amtrak. and that is the specific issue I will address today. The bill before us would cut the capital grant provided to Amtrak by some $352 million and cut the operating grant by $119 million below the enacted fiscal year 2013 levels. Such cuts would likely force Amtrak to reduce its maintenance levels and furlough maintenance personnel. Such cuts may even lead to reduced service on the Northeast corridor. the critical link on the eastern seaboard among Washington. D.C.. Baltimore. Philadelphia. New York. and Boston. In their views on the TransportationHUD appropriations measure. the minority noted that this bill is out of touch with reality and that it is nowhere more evident than in the proposed funding level for Amtrak. While the House majority has undertaken a relentless effort to destroy Amtrak. the traveling public has made it clear they consider Amtrak to be an essential part of our Nations transportation network. Amtrak finished fiscal year 2012 having carried more than 31 million passengersthe highest number of passengers in any year since Amtrak was created. This total included more than 11 million passengers who traveled on the Northeast corridor. Together. the longdistance routes had their highest passenger volumes in 19 years and Amtrak set 12 consecutive monthly ridership records in fiscal year 2012. To put this number in perspective. if Amtrak were an airline. it would be the sixth largest in the country. Americans have voted with their ticket purchases. and they are choosing to ride Amtrak in greater numbers. In fact. record ridership growth is continuing in fiscal year 2013. Rather than seeking to destroy a service critical to our Nations mobility. we should be investing in this system to ensure it can continue to meet increased passenger demand with increased speed and efficiency. Significant infrastructure improvements are needed all along the Northeast corridor to create truly highspeed rail service. In Maryland. for example. the B&P tunnel. which carries every train traveling into Washington. D.C.. from all points north of the city. must be replaced. This tunnel was opened in 1873 and its design limits train speeds to 30 miles per hour. We would not think of relying on technology from the 1870s in other aspects of our lives. We wouldnt want medical technology or communications technology from the 1870s. And we should not be content to rely on transportation infrastructure from the 1870s. The President has rightly threatened to veto this bill. and rather than waste the Houses time on legislation like this that threatens to degrade our transportation networks and delay passengers and commerce. we should be considering bills that will make long overdue investments to expand our mobility and support our economic growth. Rather than cutting investments in Amtrak. we should be investing in the development of truly highspeed rail on the Northeast corridor and throughout the northeastern United States. And before we consider this or any other appropriations measures. the House and Senate should follow regular order by appointing conferees who can resolve a budget that can be adopted by both bodies and that can then guide the development of appropriations measures for fiscal year 2014. I urge Members to oppose this misguided legislation. and I yield back the balance of my time.
1130043596,"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2879 and to the failure of this House to address the issues of real concern to the American people and the people of my district. Congress has been in session now for more than 200 days. and yet we have not passed a single bill to create a single job. The government must be funded by October. yet House Republicans have refused to appoint conferees to resolve a budget resolution after repeatedly calling for regular order. After bringing to the floor a farm bill that gutted the SNAP program on which tens of millions of hungry Americans depend. including 17 million children. the majority brought a THUD appropriations measure that would have gutted the Community Development Block Grant program. the HOME program. Amtrak. and the effort to modernize our Nations air traffic control system. It became clear this week. however. that the majority did not have the votes to pass it. We could be working today to end the damaging cuts imposed by the Ryan budget. which the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee called ""unrealistic and illconceived."" Thats the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Instead of working on any of these issues. were wasting the last days remaining before a 5week recess on a measure that threatens to impede our Nations law enforcement efforts and continues senseless attacks on our Nations civil servants. H.R. 2879. the bill before us now. was thrown together last night from the ruins of three bills the majority did not have the votes to pass yesterday. The Rules Committee had to call an emergency meeting last night to push this bill through. and no amendments are being allowed. So what would this legislation do? First and foremost. it would undermine our Nations law enforcement activities. In fact. this bill should more appropriately be called the ""Ignoring the Concerns of Law Enforcement Act."" It would allow individuals to record telephone calls and inperson conversations with Federal employees. including Federal law enforcement agents. without their knowledge. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys. and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association have all written letters opposing these provisions. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association wrote: This legislation puts law enforcement activities at risk and does a disservice to the brave men and women who are asked to put their lives on the line to protect us from terrorists and criminals. The Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association wrote: This proposal risks undermining criminal investigations by reducing the willingness of individuals to cooperate with law enforcement. and would result in the creation of recordings of law enforcement conversations that could jeopardize sensitive and important criminal and counterterrorism investigations. This morning. after listening to the debate we had here on this floor yesterday. and after this bill was filed last night. the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys sent a letter to every Member of the House. opposing the bill. Their letter states: Section 301 of H.R. 2879 will undermine Federal civil enforcement activities and criminal prosecutions during the investigative. pretrial. trial. and enforcement phases of litigation involving the interests of the United States. The fact is that we have held no hearings on this legislation before we marked it up in committee last week. We had no testimony from law enforcement officials about their concerns with the bill. Instead. the House Republicans rushed it to the floor without adequate consideration. In fact. in their rush to bring this bill to the floor. committee Republicans apparently did not even contact key law enforcement agencies to make sure this bill would not harm ongoing investigations. This morning. I directed my staff to contact the Department of Justice. the FBI. and the Department of Homeland Security. including its operational components. the Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Officials from all of these entities have now reported that they have significant operational concerns with the bill. Does that matter to the supporters of this bill? Dont you think it makes sense to hear from key stakeholders before changing Federal law in this extreme way? The bill also would interfere with existing State laws prescribing the conditions under which conversations can be recorded. Thirtysix years ago. my home State of Maryland enacted a law that made it a felony to record a private conversation unless every party to the conversation consents to the recording or another exception applies. Maryland statute requires actual consent. not forced or assumed consent. The bill negates these protectionsand the protections of 11 other Statesby deeming Federal employees. including all law enforcement personnel. to have consented to the recording of their official conversations just by coming to work. The bill has several other troubling provisions. It would remove due process protections from members of our Senior Executive Service by giving politically appointed agency heads broad discretion to fire these employees without providing advance notice. without conducting a proper investigation. and without giving employees an opportunity to respond to accusations against them. Under this bill. employees could be fired and then forced to prove their innocence to seek reinstatement. This turns on its head the most basic protection guaranteed to all Americans by our Constitution: the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. I urge Members to reject this senseless. illconsidered legislation that will impede law enforcement activities and eliminate constitutional protections for civil servants. I urge Members to vote ""no"" on H.R. 2879. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130070026,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2860. the OPM IG Act. which is a successful product of the bipartisan efforts of Federal Workforce Subcommittee Chairman Farenthold and Ranking Member LYNCH. and I applaud them for their efforts. I thank my distinguished colleagues for their work and commitment in sponsoring legislation to provide the Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management with critically needed funding to perform audits. investigations. and oversight of OPMs revolving fund activities. Through the revolving fund. OPM provides approximately $2 billion in services to agencies on a feeforservice basis. These services include background investigations. leadership training. and human resource management. H.R. 2860 would fix the loophole in the current law which prevents this $2 billion revolving fund from paying for the costs of the OPM Inspector General to properly oversee the funds activities. This legislation would allow the OPM Inspector General to use a very small portion of the revolving fund budget. up to a maximum of onethird of 1 percent of the fund. to pay for audit. investigative. and oversight work. The recent Navy Yard shooting and the Edward Snowden leaks of classified information have highlighted the importance of comprehensive oversight of the Federal Governments background investigation and security clearance process. During last Junes Federal Workforce Subcommittee hearing on OPMs revolving fund. the OPM Inspector General expressed substantial concerns about the falsification of background investigations. The OPM Inspector General plays a crucial part in ensuring that the background investigation process used by the government to determine whether individuals should be trusted with our Nations classified and sensitive information is properly conducted. This legislation would give the OPM Inspector General the funds and resources needed to conduct the necessary oversight activities to help safeguard our government against national security risks. The Senate has already passed a substantially similar bill. and I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting H.R. 2860. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130075258,I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Chairman ISSA for sponsoring this bill with me. This bill. if enacted. would be a landmark reform of our most important open government law. the Freedom of Information Act. This legislation would make significant improvements to the current law. which has not been consistently implemented. During the Clinton administration. Attorney General Janet Reno adopted a policy under which the Department of Justice would defend an agencys use of a FOIA exemption only when the agency could reasonably foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by that exemption. In the Bush administration. Attorney General John Ashcroft reversed this standard and directed the Justice Department to defend agency decisions to withhold records. as long as they had a legal basis for doing so. President Obama. to his credit. on his first day in office. directed agencies to implement FOIA with a presumption of openness. Attorney General Holder overturned the Ashcroft standard and reinstated the foreseeable harm standard. The legislation before us today would codify. in law. this presumption in favor of disclosure. no matter who is President. Under this bill. an agency would not be allowed to withhold information in response to a FOIA request. unless disclosure is prohibited by law or would cause specific identifiable harm to an interest protected by one of FOIAs exemptions. This bill also would create an advisory committee to make recommendations to improve government transparency. The President recently endorsed this idea in the Open Government National Action Plan issued by the administration in December of 2013. This legislation also would create a pilot project to encourage participation in a centralized FOIA portal. A centralized portal. such as FOIAonline. that is run by EPA. allows requesters to use one Webcast to file requests to multiple agencies. The bill also would strengthen the Office of Government Information Services by enhancing its role in providing guidance to agencies and ensuring that agencies notify requesters of their right to use its mediation services. The bill would strengthen the independence of this office by allowing it to send testimony and reports directly to Congress without approval from the Office of Management and Budget. I urge every Member of this body to support this open government legislation by voting for it. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130075739,Madam Chairman. I rise in opposition to this legislation. For the last three years. House Republicans have repeatedly attacked critical public health. safety. and environmental protections. This package of antiregulatory bills is just another such attack on agency rulemakingsone that is falsely advertised as an effort to improve transparency. Title one of this bill. which was reported by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. would prevent a rule from taking effect until certain information is posted online for at least six months. The only exception to this requirement would be for the agency to forgo a notice and comment period or for the President to issue an Executive Order. This delay is completely unnecessary and is effectively a sixmonth moratorium on rules. It also could give agencies a perverse incentive to avoid a public comment period altogether if a statutory or courtordered deadline could be missed. Just one example of a rule that could be affected by this bill is the Food and Drug Administrations proposed rule on electronic prescribing information. which would ensure that doctors have the most current safety information on prescription drugs. Under this bill. this drug safety rule could not be finalized until OMB posts information about the rule on its web site for six months. FDA. like other agencies. already details the status of its rulemakings on its website. and extensive information about proposed rules is also available on the website Regulations.gov. Yet under this bill. if OMB failed to post a required piece of information. FDA could not finalize the rule unless the President stepped in and issued an Executive Order. It should not be that hard for doctors to have the most uptodate safety information about prescription drugs. That is just title one of this Frankenstein bill. The other three titles of this bill are even worse. One title would add 60 additional requirements to the rulemaking process. We should be making the regulatory process more efficient and effective. Adding 60 new requirements will do exactly the opposite and make it needlessly complex. Madam Chairman. this is a package of bad bills that would do nothing to improve our rulemaking process. I urge every Member to oppose it.
1130090086,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Just shy of 1 year ago. the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported the IRS had used inappropriate criteria to review applicants for taxexempt status. The very same day. Chairman ISSA went on national TV. before he received a single document or interviewed a single witness. and said the following: ""This was the targeting of the Presidents political enemies effectively. and lies about it during the election year."" Republicans have spent the past year trying to prove these allegations. The IRS has spent more than $14 million responding to Congress and has produced more than a half a million pages of documents. We have interviewed 39 witnesses. 40 witnesses. IRS witnesses. Treasury Department employees. and after all of that. we have not found any evidence of White House involvement or political motivation. Yesterday. I issued a report with key portions from the nearly 40 interviews conducted by the committee to date. and these were witnesses. Mr. Speaker. called by the majority. These interviews showed. definitively. that there was no evidence of any White House direction or political bias. instead they describe in detail how the inappropriate terms were first developed and how there was inadequate guidance on how to process the application. Now. let me be clear that I am not defending Ms. Lerner. I wanted to hear what she had to say. I have questions about why she was unaware of the inappropriate criteria for more than a year after they were created. I want to know why she did not mention the inappropriate criteria in her letters to Congress. but I could not vote to violate an individuals Fifth Amendment rights. just because I want to hear what she has to say. A much greater principle is at stake here today. the sanctity of the Fifth Amendment rights for all citizens of the United States of America. and I will not walk a path that has been tread by Senator McCarthy and the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. In this case. a vote for contempt not only would endanger the rights of American citizens. but it would be a pointless and costly exercise. When Senator McCarthy pursued a similar case. the judge dismissed it. The Supreme Court has said that a witness does not waive her rights by professing her innocence. In addition. more than 30 independent experts have now come forward to conclude that Chairman ISSA botched the contempt procedure by not giving Ms. Lerner the proper warnings at the March 5 hearing. when he rushed to cut off my microphone and adjourn the hearing before any Democrat had the chance to utter a syllable. For instance. Stan Brand. who served as the House Counsel from 1976 to 1983. concluded that Chairman ISSAs actions were ""fatal to any subsequent prosecution."" The experts who came forward are from all across the country and all across the political spectrum. J. Richard Broughton. a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association and a law professor. concluded that Ms. Lerner ""would likely have a defense to any ensuing criminal prosecution for contempt pursuant to the existing Supreme Court precedent."" I didnt say that. The Republican National Lawyers Association member said that. Rather than squandering our valuable resources. pursuing a contempt vote that more than 30 independent experts have concluded will fail in court. we should release the nearly 40 transcripts. in their entirety. that have not yet been made public and allow all Americans to read the unvarnished facts for themselves. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130117135,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of this bill and I want to thank Representative MARK MEADOWS for his hard work on this bill. This bill would make the Federal Governments records more transparent. This bill includes the language of a bill I introduced. the Electronic Message Preservation Act. That portion of the legislation would require the Archivist of the United States to issue regulations mandating that within 2 years of enactment all Federal agencies manage and preserve their email records electronically. The bill would also direct the Archivist to establish standards for the preservation and management of electronic Presidential records and to annually certify that the White House has records management controls in place that meet those standards. Under this bill. the Archivist must report 1 year after the President leaves office on whether the controls used by the President met the required standards. This amendment would move agencies out of the arcane printandfile recordkeeping systems that many of them still use. a system which can lead to records getting lost or not being turned over in response to requests. This bill also includes an amendment offered by my colleague Representative JACKIE SPEIER during the committee markup. The Speier amendment would provide a clearer standard for agencies to follow with regard to which records had to be kept and for how long. Under this approach. the records of senior agency officials would be kept permanently. This bill also provides procedures for agencies to follow if an employee intentionally destroys records. Under this bill. employees will be held accountable and they will also receive the same due process rights that they have under current law. There are a couple of issues with this bill that I would like to flag. One concern that has been raised is that the bill could have the unintended consequence of encouraging Federal employees to save every email. Under current law. the National Archives works with agencies to establish schedules that define how long an agency has to keep categories of records. Agencies cant save everything forever or the volume would be so overwhelming we wouldnt be able to sort out important information from junk. We should evaluate this concern and just ensure that we arent creating unintended consequences. Another concern that has been raised with this bill is that. in attempts to restrict the manner in which the President and Vice President create records. the bill says the President and Vice President or a covered employee may not create or send a Presidential or Vice Presidential record using a nonofficial electronic messaging account unless the President or Vice President or covered employee takes certain steps. Those steps include copying an official email account. forwarding a copy of the email to an official account. or printing the email and properly archiving it. The Presidential Records Act already requires the President. the Vice President. and their immediate staff to preserve their records. I think we should just make sure that we are not crossing the line in the requirements for the President and the Vice President. I believe those two concerns should be evaluated and addressed if this bill is considered in the Senate. Again. I strongly support this bill and urge my colleagues to support it. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.

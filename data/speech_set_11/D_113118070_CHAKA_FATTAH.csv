1130025800,I just wanted to come to the floor. I have had the opportunity to serve on this subcommittee under the leadership of my great friend from Texas and our ranking member. Congressman BISHOP from Georgia. The focus of the work is in a bipartisan process to come up with the best possible set of proposals to move our country forward to respond to our needs in terms of military construction. I rise today. in particular. to thank the two leaders of the subcommittee. and in particular. the chairman for his great leadership on veterans benefits. I had breakfast with General Shinseki. and the staff of the VA I think has been clearly moved by the ranking member and the chairmans insistence that we deal with the challenges around the backlog. I want to particularly note the great work in this bill on neuroscience and brain disorders. The chairman and I began some work together in the CJS appropriations process a year and a half ago. which has moved our country. I think. forward in terms of dealing with some 600 different brain diseases and disorders in a much more aggressive fashion. and we compliment the President on the brain initiative. Right here in this VA bill there are actual concrete steps being taken to deal with posttraumatic stress. to deal with traumatic brain injury. And I had a Nobel Prize laureate. who has done work on TV. really come just to say that the focus we put on this has been so important because some 40 percent of our injured veterans have some type of traumatic brain injury or posttraumatic stress challenges that they face. I visited the Intrepid Center. So I didnt want this moment to pass without thanking the two leaders of the subcommittee for their work. I could go on and on about the Epilepsy Centers of Excellence. but I know I only have a few minutes. so Ill cease here. I want to thank them. because it wont necessarily be recorded. But in the lives of tens of thousands of our veterans and servicemen. differences in their life circumstances will be made for the positive because of whats in this bill. So thank you. and I yield back the balance of my time.
1130042067,Mr. Chairman. I come to address the House. the Congress of the United States. We are the wealthiest country in the world. We are the most powerful country in the world. We have one program that focuses on improving the lives and life chances of people in our lowerincome communities across our country. Its called the Community Development Block Grant. It was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1974. Since its inception. we have invested about $132 billion in some 1.209 communities across our country. Over the life of this program. we have invested about the same amount as we took to build the International Space Station. In 1 year. we spent approximately the same amount in Afghanistan. This year. we are spending $3.3 billion on the Community Development Block Grant. which is the lowest amount in the history of our Nation. What the majority. my friends on the other side. are proposing in this appropriations bill is to spend the least amount ever on this effort. They want to slash it from $3.3 billion to $1.6 billion. Now. its not that they are meanspirited. It is because the allocation for this bill is fatally deficient. It is too low to meet the needs of the greatest country on Earth in so many respects that we could be here all day in pointing out the deficiencies. but I want to focus on just this one program. Because it was created by a Republican President. it operates in the most. I think. approving way for those on the other team. That is to say that these are grants for which all of the decisions are made at the local level by Republican and Democratic Governors. by Republican and Democratic local officials. They decide what the priorities are going to be to help uplift these communities. So its unfortunate that they would single out this particular programthe only program that we have to help the neediest communities across our country. Ive seen it. It has worked in local business districts. encouraging small business development. Ive seen its work in helping seniors put in major systems repair and heating and windows or roofing so that they can be protected in the winter. This is a great program. even though it was developed by a President of the other party. It operates through local decisionmaking. Its already at the lowest level ever. and if you added up what weve invested in it in all of these years. it wouldnt add up to what weve spent in building the International Space Station. If we added up all that weve spent on it in all of these years. it barely gets to the number we spend in 1 year in Afghanistan. but we still think somehow we should cut it in half. Its a wrongheaded decision. I would ask that we reconsider it. I know the allocation is tough. but its going to be a lot tougher on so many more Americans who live in communities. in being reminded of what JayZ said. that have their shades on and are just waiting on the Sun to shine their way. I would ask my colleagues to think about that as we go forward. Think about the wrongheadedness of this and how unworthy it is for the greatest country on Earth to say to its citizens who need our help that somehow we can spend money in Afghanistanin some far off placeor that we can build a great International Space Station. which I support. but that we cant do anything about the challenges in these neighborhoods. I ask the entire House to live up to our responsibilities in a much different way than we are doing now. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130095139,The gentleman moved back and forth from the original allegations to todays report from the inspector general. but left out some very important points. and I want to make sure the House is operating from full information. The allegation that veterans died for a lack of care was not proven by todays report. In fact. the inspector general said today they have no ability to determine this issue. The actual whistleblower who made this allegation in the first place was on FOX News on Sunday and said that he had no ability to tie the death to the delay. I think we dont want to create a situation where we dont have veterans seeking care based on misinformation. So what I want to do is just take a minute and make sure the House is aware that under every analysis. the care at the VA is good or excellent. This is from the actual veterans care organizations and their testimony before the Congress. House. and Senate. In fact. today. I had a young woman who was a paralyzed Vietnam war veteran. She walked into my office. She is involved in a spinal cord program at the Bronx VA that has got her up and walking. It is part of the ReWalk system. She was first denied some benefits because her autoimmune deficiency was caused by agent orange. and that had been denied for many years. But under General Shinseki. they have allowed this. And now. because she had more than a 50 percent disability. a quality wheel chair and other access. I want to make this point clear. One is that no one anywhere has found that some veteran died because of a lack of service. It has not been proven. It is an allegation. There is an investigation. And we should see the investigation to its conclusion. But the one thing we dont want to do is create a situation where veterans who need care dont pursue it. And especially in spinal cord and in terms of artificial limbs and traumatic brain injury. there is no better care that our veterans can get than at the VA. So I just want to make this point that we are not dealing with the substance of the amendment. but that on the facts of this investigation the House would be well served to let us have an investigation and then let us react to what the facts are. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130095324,Mr. Chairman. to establish justice. the Founders had embraced at the earliest moments the notion that access to our court system was a critically important. indispensable right of citizenship in our country. We had a Republican President. President Nixon. who created the Legal Services Corporation to provide access to our courts. notwithstanding the economic circumstances of Americans. Legal Services operates in each of our States. and we have a responsibility as we consider this bill to think about where the gaps in justice exist. The chairman has been extraordinarily helpful in trying to focus on this question. However. I think that in terms of the numbers as presented. I side more with the author of the amendment inasmuch as that DEA we are fundingand it is critically important in a city like my own and in communities all across our countrybut we are funding DEA at $35 million above the request. That is after OMB. after DEA walked through their numbers. looked at the budget. ascertained what was needed. The committees mark at the moment. the chairmans mark. would provide more than what was requested. whereas. when we look at Legal Services. it is $80 million shy of what was requested. So I think that if we are trying to balance the scales of justice here. the idea that thousands of active service military personnel have relied on Legal Services to protect their homes from foreclosure. to deal with other types of issues. that we have veterans who depend on access to community Legal Services or Legal Services as provided under this program. that the House at this moment should consider the author of the amendment and his point. which is that we should provide an additionalit is less than $20 millionis it $15 million?-for the Legal Services Corporation. and that in terms of the DEA we would still be funding it higher than the requested level. but we would be making sure that not only citizens could have access to the courts. but that Active Duty military and our veterans would have access to lawyers that they otherwise could not afford to protect their legal rights. given the fact that they wear or have worn the uniform to protect our due process rights. I stand in support of this amendment. and I hope that the House would vote in favor of it. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130095360,It is said that you need to be able to hold opposing. competing views all at once. so here we go. First of all. I think that the DEA is one of our extraordinary law enforcement agencies under DOJ. I think the Attorney General has done a great job. and I definitely believe that the administrator of DEA has done a great job rounding up cartel members and doing all kinds of work. interfacing with Interpol in its efforts. So on one level. I disagree with my colleague in his characterization. However. I also agree that the $35 million plusup over the requested amount is too large. which is why I supported and will support the notion that some percentage of those dollars should go into legal services versus going to an agency that didnt need it or request it. so I dont think we should be plussing it up by $35 million. notwithstanding the fact that I dont agree with the gentleman. in terms of their performance. per se. on a host of issues. Now. I think that the gentleman is really concerned about the underlying question about his home State and States similarly situated. and I agree with him there that the State has made a different decision and that there should not be unnecessary harassment relative thereto. but if we are going to repeal prohibition every 100 years or sowe did alcohol in 1933maybe we are at the moment where we are going to do something similar on marijuana. It does not mean. however. that we think every illegal narcotic in the world should be available without penalty or punishment for every single person who might desire it. So the country is trying to make some decisions. and we have to kind of parse through this as we work forward. So I rise to say that I dont support the amendment in which we would take this $35 million and put it into what is called deficit reduction. I suggest that the 41.000 veterans who are able to fight off foreclosure and other challenges by using legal services last year. those dollars should go to legal services. so that our veterans can have the legal services that they need in order to interface with our civil court system and to have the rights that they fought for protected. So I think the House will be able to work its will. I hope that we vote against this amendment and that we support the effort to put these dollars into legal services and that we continue to hold high the great courage and sacrifice of our law enforcement agencies as they fight crime here and abroad. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130095462,Mr. Chairman. when you listen to our highest law enforcement officials in the country and our national security officials. they join the Chairmans very early point. When he was saying it. no one was paying attention. I think. that cyber attacks are the greatest threat in terms of our economic infrastructure and some of our national military infrastructure is challenged by cyber attacks also. There is an account in DOJ that is the target of affection for this amendment. that is cyber and high economic crimes. This is a very important area. We remember the fiasco with the retailers being attacked by cyber attacks. mainly centered from Ukraine. and the disaster that occurred over the holiday shopping season. This is a very important area. I would be glad to work with the gentleman to see whether we can do something to make sure that this account has the resources it needs. Aeronautics. on the other hand. we are well above $100 million or so than the requested level. but it is a very important area. and I join with the chairman in prioritizing it. I went out to Washington State. I visited Everett. a plant of almost 100 acres under one roof. the largest and widest building anywhere in the country. and saw them constructing these Dreamliners. tens of thousands of Americans working every day. We dont want those secrets stolen either. however. through cyber attacks. so we need to find a happy medium that meets the countrys interests. I dont know that we want to cut that account. The chairman is right. Our balance of trade in aeronautics is well over $200 billion. It is our most significant export on the manufacturing side. so we have to be careful as we proceed. I thank the gentleman for offering the amendment. and whatever the result of the amendment. I think that the chairman and I want to work to make sure that we are doing everything we can do to protect against cyber attacks. In the economic atmosphere that the country is in and the competition that we face. we dont need to be innovative and then have our innovation stolen by others. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington .
1130095475,Madam Chair. this program has not been reauthorized by the Congress. So lets go back to that. This is a program that was created to provide support to local communities to be able to hire 1 million additional police officers nationwide. and it was put into place. It has operated well. and ever since this became the law of the land in the Clinton administration. the crime rate nationwide has gone down. We have not reauthorized it. but we have funded it each and every year because it is the right thing to do. On one level. the American public is paying taxes. and safety. to them. is having police officers in their communities and that when they dial 911. there is someone there to respond. At the same time that we have had this back and forth about the COPS program. we have provided well over $6 billion of the American taxpayers money for police officers and training in Iraq and in places like Afghanistan to provide police officers in communities in countries far away from the streets of the gentlemans city. New York City. or my hometown of Philadelphia. Now. it is true that the Congress has not done its work. We havent reauthorized the transportation bill or the education bill or the COPS program. There is a whole line of bills that we have not found the ability to come together around. and there are a host of programs in these appropriations bills that are being funded. even though the authorization has lapsed. So I think that in this particular instance. even though the point of order is correct and proper. it moves aside what should be the primary concern. which is to have cops on the street and connecting young people up with cops. which is the point of this amendment. to say that law enforcement officers are paid for under this grant program. I want to let every Member know that when this bill is finished. when it comes out of conference. there will be money for the COPS program. The only thing that this amendment seeks to say is that some of those cops should have. as their primary responsibility. interacting and intervening in the development of youth gangs because we know that if we can grab ahold of these young people while the concrete has not yet hardened. we can prevent them from taking on a life of criminal or antisocial activity. So I thank the gentleman for offering the amendment. I think it is correctly on point. and I appreciate the chairman reserving his point of order so that I can make the point that. even though unauthorized. we have the authority to appropriate this moneyand we will. as we did last year and the year before and the year before that. Because at the end of the day. cops on the street. when someone dials 911. they are not dialing in the hopes of help. They are dialing because they really need help. and we need to have police officers who can respond. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130095545,Madam Chair. I want to acknowledge the great work of the gentleman from Texas on patent reform. We worked together and he led the effort that has reformed our patent system. I think. in a remarkable way. The majority leader and I spent some time on one of the last vote days here to go over to NIH and hear from Dr. Collins about great research. particularly interested in pediatric cancers and the like. So these are two gentlemen. the authors of this amendment. who have been very positive and focused in a number of areas that I share with them. However. this amendment is misguided. and I want to speak in opposition to it. The notion that we would want to eliminate certain investigations by the National Science Foundation into economic science or behavioral science. when we talk about disasters. the reason why we have saved so many lives. it is not just that we have improved weather forecasting. even though that would be eliminated in terms of the moneys here for investigative purposes by the National Science Foundation. but also understanding the behaviors of people facing disasters is very important. That would be cut. This area of posttraumatic stress is a critical area. We know now that many of our returning soldiers face posttraumatic stress. but we also know that children living in very difficult circumstances in our country are more traumatized than if they were living in a war zone. an active war zone in another country. So eliminating. cutting back scientific investigations in this regard would be. I think. disastrous. That is why I am hoping that whatever is causing this. there will be some reversal of it eventually. But in the meantime. I want to suggest to the House that we should oppose this amendment. we should oppose the notion that somehow we dont want to know certain things. I was at the University of Pittsburgh. I saw some results of National Science Foundation funding that started out 30 years ago that a Member on this floor would be on the floor complaining about now. It was the examination of what happens in the neurons of a monkey when they move their arm. what neurons fire off in their brain. Well. that research today. 30 years later. literally has a woman who. because of a disease. has no control of her body. but can now move an artificial arm through her thoughts. This is the result of research by the National Science Foundation. It is the world premier basic science foundation. it is the model for our economic competitors. They are imitating it. A small country like Singapore with less than 5 million people is investing $7 billion in their national science foundation. Here we are. the wealthiest country in the world. and we are putting $7.4 billion. which is the highest ever. and I thank the chairman. But now we want to put handcuffs on the agency about what it is that they can look at in terms of improving the life chances of Americans. The research has paid off. That is why we are the great country that we are today. The World Economic Forum says our Nation and our Nations economy is driven by innovation. The last thing that we should be doing on the floor of this House is equivocating or compromising or making it more challenging for those who are engaged in the innovation ecosystem to do their work. Even though I compliment the gentleman. Mr. SMITH. and the majority leader. Mr. CANTOR. for all their efforts. I cant imagine for the life of me why we would be on this floor tonight debating a retreat on behavioral science. on economic science. It makes no sense. I would hope that the House. notwithstanding the fact that the majority is held by the other team. I hope in this instance. as the chairman said. we would realize that this is not a competition between Democrats and Republicans. We are competing against countries that have big and plus populations like China and India. they want to eat our lunch economically. and what we need to do is stop the bickering back and forth and figure out what is best for our country. The chairman and I voted for SimpsonBowles. We were one of just less than 40 Members who did so. I might be in the minority on this vote. but I am going to vote on what is in the best interest of our Nation. and that is to continue to invest in innovation. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas .
1130095766,Mr. Chairman. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. but the prison system that the Federal Government is operating. which has been growing exponentially over the last decade. will have gobbled upby the time we pass this billabout a fourth of the DOJs budget. This is like the PacMan arcade game that keeps eating money. Now. there are very interesting things going on in the land. There are Democrats and Republicans. There are the most conservative people in our country and the most liberal who are saying things that are fascinating. like we need to stop incarcerating so many people. that America really should not be the leading nation in the world in the percentage of people that we put in jail and that maybe we need to rethink part of what we are doing. We have the problem of having very violent criminals we dont seem to have enough prison space for because we are locking up nonviolent people for things that we should probably find some way to have diversions for. We have had multiple amendments today for diversion programs. You might not want to call them that. but that is what they aredrug courts. veterans courts. These are vehicles by which to divert people from the prison system because we know something about the prison system. We know that. if you put people in there. the most likely circumstance is that they are going to go back again and again and again and that they are going to go back for increasingly more serious and more violent activities because the one thing that is happening in the prisons is that they are becoming involved in a vocation that is essentially antisocial. I am not dealing with the amendment itself because the chairman is right. in that we need to know what it says. and we need to act in a responsible way. but we should not be. in any way. under some illusion that we are going to continue. as a country. to just put more and more people away. It doesnt make sense. and as politicians who are supposed to be leading the most powerful nation in the world. we need to start to make some sense on this point.

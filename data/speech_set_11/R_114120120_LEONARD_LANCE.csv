1140015312,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the distinguished public service of the Honorable Thomas Howard Kean. 48th Governor of New Jersey. who will become 80 years old next month. Governor Kean is one of the most respected statesmen in the country due to his tremendous contributions to the civic life of New Jersey and of the Nation. Governor Kean was born on April 21. 1935. in New York City. to Elizabeth Stuyvesant Howard and Robert Winthrop Kean. His father served for 20 years in the House of Representatives and became the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee. His grandfather. Hamilton Fish Kean. was United States Senator from New Jersey. Historians can trace his familys long and proud history of public service to William Livingston. signer of the United States Constitution and the first Governor of New Jersey. Governor Kean was graduated from Princeton University in 1957. and after military service returned to Livingston. New Jersey. named for his ancestor. Governor Kean started his own career in public office with election to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1967. Known as a thoughtful and diligent legislator. he was elected to lead the chamber in 1972. when he became the youngest speaker of the general assembly in New Jersey history. Governor Keans two successful campaigns for Governor of New Jersey were each of historical significance: in 1981. his election marked the closest margin of victory in State history. while his 1985 reelection was the largest margin of victory ever recorded in a gubernatorial race in our State. Mr. Speaker. New Jersey saw significant improvements to public education. environmental protection. access to highquality health care. and stable taxing and spending policies during the Kean governorship. His most defining legacy was his record of inclusive public engagement that facilitated progress. compromise. and the advancement of the best interests of New Jersey. Following his time in Trenton. Governor Kean served for 15 years as president of Drew University in Madison. New Jersey. where applications. the physical structure. and the endowment increased dramatically. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11. 2001. President Bush turned to Governor Kean and former Indiana Congressman Lee Hamilton to chair the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. The two chairs led an exhaustive review of the intelligence. homeland security. and governmental response before and after the acts of terror perpetrated against this country. The 911 Commissions work and leadership drew bipartisan acclaim and resulted in major reforms to improve our Nations security preparedness. The United States is safer today thanks to the tremendous work of Governor Kean and his colleagues. I had the honor to serve as an assistant counsel to Governor Kean in Trenton and am honored now to call him a constituent in the congressional district I serve. I have learned continually from Governor Kean. whether through observation or instruction. and I am among the many New Jerseyans who consider him a mentor. Governor Kean is a wonderful son and brother. husband. father and grandfather. educator. leader. colleague. and friend. He and his wife. the former Deborah Bye of Wilmington. Delaware. have raised three fine children. twin sons. Thomas and Reed. and daughter. Alexandra. His son. Thomas H. Kean. Jr.. is my successor as minority leader in the New Jersey State Senate. On his 80th birthday. I congratulate Governor Thomas H. Kean and wish him many years ahead of good health and happiness. The United States of America owes him a significant debt of gratitude for all that he has done in service to the Nation.
1140027729,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of the town of Clinton in Hunterdon County. New Jersey. Established as a separate municipality in 1865. Clinton has a rich history and is known for its natural beauty and sense of community. The 2010 Census counted the towns population at 2.719. As the recently deceased Clinton town historian and longtime mayor. Allie McGaheran. has written. the area was settled on the convergence of two rivers. the Spruce Run and the south branch of the Raritan. surrounded by excellent farmland. attracting English and German settlers. One of those settlers. David McKenny. built two mills directly across the river from each other. These treasured millsthe first dating to 1810now the Red Mill Museum Village and the Hunterdon Museum of Art. were owned by Daniel Hunt. the namesake of the towns first moniker. Hunts Mill. These mills have been the center of Clintons economic and cultural life for two centuries. Later. mill owners John Taylor and John Bray championed renaming the town after DeWitt Clinton. the builder of the Erie Canal and Governor of New York. A limestone quarry. located immediately behind the Red Mill. brought another wave of settlers. including Irish immigrants crossing the ocean to establish a better life for themselves and their families in the new world. The present municipal building. a handsome Victorian structure. was the residence of John Leigh. a brick maker and farmer who served as the towns second mayor. The Lehigh Valley Railroad provided passenger and freight access. contributing greatly to the growth and wealth of the town in the 19th century. Clinton has a large historic district that is on the State and national historic registers. There are five historic sites: the two mills. the music hall that entertained generations of residents. the original Grandin Library. named for artist and philanthropist Elizabeth Grandin in the last century. and the quarry. The 150th anniversary of Clinton is being celebrated with parades. farmers markets. art displays. performances. and other community events. I thank and congratulate Megan JonesHolt for her work as chair of the 150th anniversary committee. She and her husband. former mayor and current Hunterdon County Freeholder Matt Holt. do so very much for the town civically. Clinton is governed by the town form of government. with a mayor and six council members. Mayor Janice Kovach and the governing body of the town are greatly involved in the yearlong festivities. Clinton is served by a dedicated volunteer fire company and rescue squad. Its beautiful and historic churches are an integral part of the community. The ClintonGlen Gardner School District educates children through the eighth grade. High school students attend North Hunterdon High School in neighboring Clinton Township. one of our States strongest public elementary and secondary schools. My twin brother. Jim. and I are proud graduates of the high school. My own family has been involved in the history of Clinton for many generations. My great uncle was president of the local bank. and my father practiced law in the town for 70 years. In his essay. ""The Inspiration of Clinton."" Stephen Shoeman notes: ""Everybody in Clinton smiles. Everybody is friendly. America is beautiful because of Clinton. New Jersey. and the other towns and villages just like it."" This years celebration comes 1 year after the tricentennial of Hunterdon County. a yearlong retelling of Hunterdon Countys storied founding and its 300year journey in advancement from the English colonies in North America to its presentday status as one of Americas premier places to live and work. Clintons history is ingrained in the fabric of Hunterdon County. We have also just celebrated New Jerseys 350th anniversary. Publicspirited residents have worked to keep Clinton beautiful and the epitome of smalltown American life. Their efforts maintain a charming and vibrant merchant district. excellent public schools. meaningful cultural events. and significant engagement in public affairs. The town of Clinton thrives on neighborly camaraderie. I am deeply honored to represent the town here in the House of Representatives. And all who love Clinton congratulate the town on its landmark celebration."
1140040317,"Mr. Speaker. I congratulate the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida for her magnificent service regarding the foreign policy of this country and her continued expertise that is of benefit to the entire Nation. In the coming days. the American people and those of us in Congress will be able to scrutinize an anticipated agreement between Iran and the P5+1 countries and Irans nuclear weapons program. Congress will debate and consider the administrations proposal. and I will be looking to ensure that any agreement achieves the paramount goal that Iran will never get nuclear weapons. A nuclear Iran would fundamentally change the international dynamic and put the United States and our allies. including Israel. in extreme peril. The balance of power in the world would slip away from those who have given blood and treasure in the fight for freedom and justice. while rewarding the perpetrators of some of the most heinous crimes against humanity. The principle of peace through deterrence would be compromised and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would be a footnote in history as rival and regional powers race to acquire their own nuclear weapons. A nuclear arms race will be yet another element of unpredictability in the worlds most volatile region. I do not oppose any agreement. I oppose a bad agreement. Sanctions brought Iran to the table. and sanctions will keep Iran there. Any deal that needlessly surrenders that valuable leverage in the name of taking Irans word is a bad agreement. There is simply not the trust that state sponsors of terror will suddenly and uncharacteristically prove to be honest. As Ronald Reagan famously said. ""Trust. but verify."" That was true then. it is as true now as then. It is certainly true regarding Iran. A successful nuclear agreement must include tangible Iranian concessions. Steps to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure. a commitment to a robust inspections regime. and a cease to its dubious terrorrelated activities must be included in any agreement. The entire world will be watching. not only the 315 million people of this country. but certainly the people in the Middle East. which is extremely dangerous. This matter of great consequence will have farreaching ramifications. and certainly. I hope that the President. the Secretary of State. and the administration will heed the bipartisan concerns that exist here in Congress. The President reluctantly signed the legislation that reached his desk. That was an expression of the will of the American people through elected Representatives here and in the other House of Congress. overwhelming in its nature. and certainly. I hope that the President and Secretary of State and the administration will recognize that the American people are deeply concerned about what appears to be the parameters of an agreement. There is still time to reach a better agreement. Let me repeat. no agreement is superior to a bad agreement. as Prime Minister Netanyahu stated in this Chamber this spring. I hope that Iran will come meaningfully to the table. I hope that Iran will cease its terrorist activities across the globe. I hope Iran will recognize that. if it were to achieve nuclear weapons. it would be the beginning of a situation with unintended consequences for the Middle East. the most dangerous part of the world. terrible consequences for our friend and ally. a country that believes in democracy. Israel. terrible consequences for other Arab nations. including Saudi Arabia. Egypt. and places beyond that. and that we want to live in peace with the Iranian people. The Iranian people are a great people. a talented people. a welleducated people. and certainly. I hope that the people of Iran recognize that it is not in their best interest that their leaders develop nuclear weapons. Again. I commend with every breath I take the superb work of the gentlewoman from Florida. I am pleased to be able to join with her and with others this evening to caution that we must ensure a strong agreement and. if that is not possible. then no agreement at all."
1140057840,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3762. the Restoring Americans Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. This comprehensive package focuses on significant portions of ObamaCare. striking onerous tax and mandate provisions. and laying the groundwork for a new President elected in 2016 to complete a full replacement plan of ObamaCarenot repealrepeal and replacement. According to the Congressional Budget Office. the package reduces the deficit by nearly $130 billion and provides a 1year moratorium on all Federal mandatory funding for Planned Parenthood. a moratorium to Planned Parenthood. but that funding is redirected elsewhere. to community health organizations that do a fine job across this country. Under the leadership of Chairman UPTON. provisions finally end the ObamaCare fund. known as the Prevention and Public Health Fund. which gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services billions of dollars to spend each year with little accountability. All Members of Congress should recognize that that responsibility belongs to us here in this branch of government and not in the executive branch. Funds from this program have financed questionable programs. and there has been waste. Some Democrats have joined in calling for its termination. The Energy and Commerce Committee sections also direct that the Planned Parenthood funding will go to other organizations highqualityaccess healthcare options both for women and men. Contributions from both the House Education and Workforce and Ways and Means Committees also include the repeal of a series of significant pieces of ObamaCare. including the repeal of the individual and employer mandates. the repeal of the 40 percent excise Cadillac taxand there is no one I know who favors that Cadillac tax. certainly those hardworking men and women who are in labor organizations in this countryand that forces people to accept different insurance coverage from the coverage they knew and liked. and it includes the repeal of the medical device tax. which increases the cost of care. discourages medical innovation. and harms job creation. particularly in my home State of New Jersey. Because the legislation was developed through the reconciliation process. it will be protected from a filibuster in the Senate and could be passed in that body by a simple majority. I call for majority passage in the Senate of the United States. Reconciliation is our best chance to send meaningful legislation to the Presidents desk. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.
1140074866,"Mr. Speaker. I rise to recognize and to celebrate the tremendous work of Dr. Angus Stewart Deaton of Princeton. New Jersey. who was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Dr. Deaton is a renowned academic. who is the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of International Affairs and Professor of Economics and International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Economics Department at Princeton University. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences selected Dr. Deaton for the Swedish National Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel for his work regarding consumption. poverty. and welfare. The work is of critical importance to the entire world. The Nobel Committee said in its selection announcement: ""The Laureate. Angus Deaton. has deepened our understanding of different aspects of consumption. His research concerns issues of immense importance for human welfare. not least in poor countries. Deatons research has greatly influenced both practical policymaking and the scientific community. By emphasizing the links between individual consumption decisions and outcomes for the whole economy. his work has helped transform modern microeconomics. macroeconomics. and development economics."" The Nobel Committee elaborated on its decision: Dr. Deaton received this years prize in Economic Sciences for three related achievements: the system for estimating the demand for different goods that he and John Muellbauer developed around 1980. the studies of the link between consumption and income that he conducted around 1990. and the work he has carried out in later decades on measuring living standards and poverty in developing countries with the help of household surveys. Dr. Deaton is a man of the world. A native of Edinburgh. Scotland. he was educated as a foundation scholar at Fettes College and received his undergraduate. masters. and doctorate of philosophy degrees from the University of Cambridge. where he was later a fellow at Fitzwilliam College. He was a faculty member at the University of Bristol before coming to Princeton. He has studied and visited many nations. has used research and experiences from around the world to shape the direction of his work. and has written extensively on societal issues facing the global community. His spouse. Dr. Anne C. Case. is the Alexander Stewart 1886 Professor of Economics and Public Affairs and Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School and Economics Department at Princeton. She is also an accomplished and acclaimed faculty member who has published groundbreaking economic research. Angus Deaton has two adult children. and in their spare time. he and Professor Case enjoy the opera and trout fishing. Dr. Deaton is a superb professor. mentor. colleague. friend. and Princetonian. He is extremely worthy of this preeminent international honor. My wife. Heidi. and I and my twin brother. Jim. are proud to call Angus and Anne our friends. It is a great honor to Dr. Deatons country of birth. the United Kingdom. and to his adopted country. the United States of America. that he has received this years Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. It is also a great honor to Princeton University. whose motto is: ""In the nations service and in service of all nations."" On behalf of the Congress of the United States. I congratulate Professor Deaton. May he continue his momentous work for the betterment of the human condition in the many years that lie ahead."
1140079957,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of reforming our Nations broken mental health care system. Too often we are reminded that the countrys mental health care system is not working nearly as well as should be the case. Many Americans hide behind the curtain of shame and insecurity while many others lack access. assistance. or even information on how they may receive treatment. It is a vicious cycle. where the vulnerable who need the most care are instead left out of society. unemployable. and. in some cases. a danger to themselves and others. Recent data suggests that fewer than onethird of Americans with diagnosable mental illness actually get treatment. Experts also estimate that more than half of those who suffer from severe mental disorders do not receive treatment in any given year. At least 25 percent of returning troops from Iraq and Afghanistan will experience some type of mental health condition. We owe our servicemen and -women and veterans this effort to get them the care they need and deserve. I am proud to partner with Democratic Congresswoman DORIS MATSUI of California. with whom I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee. in recently introducing a bill to significantly expand access and strengthen community mental health and behavioral health services across the country. The Expand Excellence in Mental Health Care Act aims to expand mental health care planning grants in two dozen States. including New Jersey. through an initiative based on our 2014 Excellence in Mental Health Act that was signed into law by President Obama in 2014. This measure is directly tackling one of the most significant mental health care challenges: access. The Expand Excellence in Mental Health Act will enable more States to experiment with the tools and practices to fix this broken system. By expanding the law to include more States. we encourage greater collaboration and testing to find out what solutions work. how best to care for those who need treatment. and what we can do to keep the people of the United States safe. The Excellence in Mental Health Care Act is one of the most significant works Congress has already passed into law on mental health care. We should expand it and keep the momentum going. I am also proud to be working with Republican Congressman TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania on this issue. Dr. MURPHY. who has a Ph.D. in psychology. has been using his expertise to lead a serious discussion in the House Energy and Commerce Committee on this critical issue. His Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. which I am proud to cosponsor. takes a clinical approach to supporting families and individuals undergoing sudden or longterm mental health crises. The bill views those who need care through the mental health lens. not just through the criminal justice system. Our work on these bills is part of a larger conversation on improving mental health care in this country. These bills will help struggling families who seek the best care for their loved ones. It will help those who fear stigma to get the care they need and will give our servicemen and -women and veterans the care they deserve. I urge support for these measures. and I welcome all good ideas to the table for reforming our mental health care system.
1140106270,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer an amendment to eliminate the potential of Irans gaining access to the U.S. dollar. As Iran continues to violate international law with illicit ballistic missile tests. as it undermines U.S. foreign policy. and as it destabilizes the Middle East. the Obama administration may be willing to ease restrictions on Irans access to the dollar and potentially reward Irans international provocations with coveted access to world financial markets. We cannot allow this to happen. Since agreeing to the Iranian deal last year. the Obama administration has seemingly gone out of its way to appease Iran. Sanctions were lifted with little to show in the way of nuclear disarmament. The rogue regime is now selling oil on the international market. and Iran has received access to tens of billions of dollars held abroad and has signed deals worth over $100 billion in foreign investment. Allowing Iran to have access to the dollar would mark an unprecedented additional concession to the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism. Access to the dollar would be an undeserved reward to a country that tortures its own people. denies human rights to women. and has the blood of Americans and our allies on its hands. But in an effort to advance the nuclear agreement. I worry that the President may act unilaterallyas he has done so often in the pastand permit the Treasury Department and other Federal entities to proceed with granting Iran the access to the dollar it so desperately wants. A vote for this amendment will eliminate that possibility. Mr. Chairman. let me say that this does not change what is currently the situation in this country. Last summer. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testified that Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars through New York. hold correspondent account relationships with U.S. financial institutions. or enter into financing agreements with U.S. banks. As the Secretary made clear. Iran. in other words. will continue to be denied access to the worlds largest financial and commercial market. This amendment simply puts that promise into statutory law. and that is why I have proposed it. The Lance amendment will eliminate any possibility that we might move in the other direction. Mr. Chairman. I urge its adoption. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140111558,Mr. Speaker. I rise today as we approach the somber anniversary of the attacks of September 11. 2001. to honor the memory of the innocent people who perished on that terrible day and extend our continued prayers and sympathy to their loved ones. For 15 years. I have stood at firehouses and schools. churches and veterans halls. and heard the stories of bravery and heroism from that morning that forever changed America. New Jersey lost more than 700 residents in the attacks. 81 of them from communities I represent here in Congress. Each personal story is remarkable in its own way. offering a different memory or perspective on the events of September 11. In hearing stories from that day. Americans relive that morning. recalling where they were when they heard the news of the planes that struck the World Trade Center. the sickening realization that our Nation was under attack. and the tremendous heroism and selfsacrifice of so many in New York. at the Pentagon. and on a plane over Shanksville. Pennsylvania. Many of these stories are not new but need to be retold as a younger generation comes of age. that their neighborsinnocent people in their communitieswere targeted in an act of war upon this Nation. and from such heinous acts came brave first responders. courageously initiating rescues. knowing their lives were in great danger. friends and coworkers helping each other to safety. and many young Americans who then answered a call to service to protect and defend the United States. It is our duty to instill in the generations that follow respect and honor for the lives lost that terrible day and the lives lost in defense of our Nation in the years that have followed. It is our duty here in Congress to protect this Nation. to provide for the common defense. and vividly to recall the pain of a wounded Nation so that we be aware always of what it takes to keep this Nation safe and free. The lives lost in the ensuing battles abroad have continued to try the foundation of our will. We have proven steadfast in the commitment to our values. Our freedom and liberty have been protected by brave men and women who selflessly answered the call of service by volunteering for military service. No matter the challenges we face. we must remember that our Nation is truly blessed. I ask all Americans today to pause and reflect on the tragedy of September 11. 2001. Please pray for the victims and honor their memory. Please pay tribute to the men and women who serve and defend us today against the dangers we still face. May God bless them. and may God continue to bless the United States of America.

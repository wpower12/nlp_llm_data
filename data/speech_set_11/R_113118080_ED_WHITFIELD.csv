1130036242,"I would like to explain. number one. why I am offering this amendment and then explain. number two. specifically what this amendment does. The reason it is in handwriting is that. after we submitted the printed amendment. we had a conversation with the Parliamentarian. and a suggestion was made to change it. so it was changed. This administration has made it very clear to the American people that it is trying to dictate the fuels used to produce electricity in America. and theyve made it very clear that they are flagrantly discriminating and giving preferential treatment to the wind industry. Now. why do I say that? I dont say it because of the $12.1 billion production tax credit that the wind industry has received this year. and I dont say it because of the billions of dollars that the wind industry has received in past years. I say it because the administration has decided not to prosecute the wind industry for violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act or of the Endangered Species Act. According to an Associated Press investigation. in fact. the Obama administration has never fined or prosecuted a wind farm for killing eagles and other protected bird speciesshielding the industry from liability and helping keep the scope of the deaths secret. As a matter of fact. to show you how the administration is being very discriminatory in the prosecution of these acts. British Petroleum was fined $100 million for killing migratory birds in the gulf oil spill. ExxonMobil was fined $600.000 for killing 85 birds. PacifiCorp was fined $10.5 million for killing birds. A utility in Wyoming was fined $100.000 for killing one eagle. I could go on and on and on. Yet more than 573.000 birds were killed by the countrys wind farms last year. including 83.000 hunting birds. such as hawks. falcons and eagles. according to an estimate published in March in the peerreviewed The Wildlife Society. We know that this administration is getting the reputation of deciding what Federal laws its going to enforce and which ones its not going to enforce. Now it is deciding that we are going to prosecute on the Endangered Species Act. the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act if you happen to be in this sector of the economy. but if youre in the wind industry. were not going to prosecute you. Do you know what is even worse than that? They are now deciding that they want to carve out a rule. which the Obama administration has proposed. that would give wind energy companies potentially decades of shelter from the prosecution of the killing of any birds. The regulation is currently under review at the White House. The proposal. which was made at the urging of the wind industry. would allow companies to apply for 30year permits to kill bald eagles. golden eagles and other migratory birds. Previously. companies were only eligible for 5year permits. Its basically guaranteeing a black box for 30 years. and theyre saying. Trust us for oversight. ""This is not the path forward."" said Katie Umekubo. a renewable energy attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. So why should the American people be giving billions of dollars to this industry and be allowing this administration not to prosecute them when they are obviously killing thousands of birdsin direct violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. and of the Endangered Species Act? My amendment simply says. with regard to the $24 million set aside for research and development in the committee report. that it not be allowed to use that money simply because of the extraordinary protection this administration is going to provide to prevent them from being prosecuted under the existing Federal laws that this Congress passed many years ago. That is the purpose of the amendment. and I would respectfully urge Members to vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130055946,Mr. Speaker. one of the basic premises of our U.S. Constitution and form of government is equal protection under the law and equal protection and equal application of the law. Now the Obama administration has developed a reputation of unequal application of Federal laws. For example. Jon Stewart. the talk show host. recently interviewed Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. and he asked her a question that many Americans have been asking. and that was: Why has the Obama administration given waivers and extra time to companies and labor unions so that they do not have to meet the deadlines required by ObamaCare. but he is unwilling to give that waiver and the same additional time to individuals? Now. we know that under the law. individuals are required to buy insurance. and if they do not buy insurance. then they will have to pay a penalty or a fine. That was a question that many people have been asking. Thats been part of the debate. by the way. of this continuing resolution. as well as the debt ceiling issue. Why cannot individuals be given additional time and consideration to meet this law. but you do give time to companies and labor unions? That is an unequal application of Federal law. By the way. Secretary Sebelius could not answer that question. Now. just as the administration favors companies and unions over individuals in that context of ObamaCare. the administration is also giving special favors to the wind industry in the energy sector. For example. the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act have been enforced for many years by Federal prosecutors in America. To give you an example. we all are very much aware of the tremendous oil spill in the gulf a few years ago. Well. British Petroleum Company was fined $100 million for killing migratory birds. We have a number of former Federal prosecutors in the U.S. Congress. and I was talking to one of them just yesterday. He was telling me about a case that he had down in North Carolina in which an individual shot and killed an eagle. and that gentleman was prosecuted by the Federal Government. fined $100.000. and had to forfeit some profits from his timber company. And so the Federal Government has been quite forceful in the protection of eagles and also migratory birds. Now. wind projects. and Im quoting now from an article that appeared in the paper just a couple days ago. wind projects routinely violate the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. but not one wind farm in America has ever faced a single prosecution or paid one penny in fines. As I said. BP alone paid a $100 million fine for killing migratory birds. I could also quote a utility company in Wyoming in which some eagles were electrocuted. and that company paid a $200.000 or $300.000 fine. According to studies by the Fish and Wildlife Service and other groups. wind turbines overall kill over 573.000 birds each year. including over 83.000 birds of prey. Now. thats according to a study this March in the Wildlife Society Bulletin. So the Federal Government. under this administration. is not prosecuting violations of these Federal laws because of their favor of the wind industry. But worse than that. now the Department of the Interior has notified through a publication on September 27 in the Federal Register that they are going to pass a regulation so that wind companies cannot be prosecuted for killing eagles and migratory birds in most circumstances. So they havent been prosecuting under existing laws. and now we are going to pass a regulation to give them additional protections. As this article says. there are two scandals here. First. wind turbines are killing legally protected eagles in the name of slowing climate change. but whatever reductions in carbon dioxide emissions that may be occurringand Im not going to go through all the facts and figures here in this articlebut whatever emissions may be occurring is equivalent. according to this article. to a babys burp in a hurricane. And then. second. the wind energy industry is lobbying to extend a production tax credit. the 2.2 centperkilowatthour subsidy. that has caused windmills to be built in America. Without that subsidy. it is doubtful any would be built. but last year. the subsidy was extended for an additional year at a cost to taxpayers of $12 billion. Now another 1year extension is being lobbied for by the industry. That would cost an additional $6.1 billion. So it is bad enough that this wind industry wants to continue killing eagles with impunity. but now they are asking the taxpayers to give them the money so that they can do it. Now. as chairman of the Energy Committee. unlike President Obama. I genuinely do believe and understand that we need an alloftheabove policy on energy. We need renewable energy. we need windmills. we need solar panels. we need nuclear. we need natural gas. and we need coal. But to exempt one industry from Federal laws because they are favored by this administration is not what America is all about. Now the President goes all over the country talking about an alloftheabove energy policy. but how many people in America know that because of his administration and regulations at EPA. America is the only country in the world where you cannot build a new coalpowered plant. And yet even in Europe. which is known as a green energy sector. they have on the drawing board 60 gigatons of new coalfired plants. and we continue to export more coal today than we ever have to other countries that recognize they have to have coal to be competitive in the global marketplace because coal does produce lowcost electricity. But. as I said. unlike the President. I genuinely believe we need everything. but I do not believe that any industry. certainly not the wind industry or any other industry. should be exempt from Federal laws that protect endangered speciesmigratory birds and eaglesthat are the symbol of this great country. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130077596,"Mr. Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair. I rise this afternoon in support of H.R. 3826. the Electricity Security and Affordability Act. Recently. a constitutional law professor at George Washington University named Jonathan Turley issued a dire warning. Professor Turley said that he voted for President Obama in the last election. that he agrees philosophically with President Obama on many issues. but he said that. if left unchecked. the U.S. President could effectively become a government unto himself. He was referring to the fact that this President has been overly aggressive in the use of executive orders and regulations through various governmental agencies to accomplish his political goals. The reason that we are here today is. with this legislation. it is our hope that we can overturn one of the most extreme regulations of the Obama administration. In January of next year. it is anticipated that they will finalize a rule from EPA that will make it impossible to build a new coalpowered plant in America. That is hard to believe that that can be the situation in our great country. particularly since 40 percent of our electricity comes from coal. The reason that it would be impossible to build a new coalpowered plant because of these new EPA regulations is the fact that the emission standards have been set so high. and I might add that it is pretty clear that those emission standards. the way they were set. violates the Energy Security Act of 2005. We have written a letter to EPA setting out our concerns. They still have not responded to us. We have talked to lawyers throughout the country who are ready to file a lawsuit if this happens because it is impossible to believe that the three plants in America that used to set the emission standards for new coalpowered plants. none of those plants are in existence today. None of them are operating today. So our legislation. we believe. is a reasonable approach to a serious problem for America. I might add that 41 out of 50 States last year indicated that their electricity rates have gone up under the Obama administration. I know that the President is greatly concerned about the less fortunate in our society. He has talked a lot about the minimum wage bill. for example. but these electricity rates going up hit the most vulnerable in our society the most. particularly those on fixed incomes. Yet it is his policies that are driving up these electricity costs. So the legislation that we have on the floor today is very simple. First of all. it acknowledges for the first time by legislation that EPA can regulate greenhouse gases. This bill goes farther than any other bill has. So you can regulate greenhouse gases. but when you set the emissions standard. the unit must be in operation for a period of time. It must be commercially available to the utilities to buy it. as opposed to the proposed regulation in which the technology is simply not available. So our legislation. as I said. we dont anticipate a new coalpowered plant to be built anytime soon in America because our natural gas prices are so low. But in Europe. which it is acknowledged is the green sector of the world. they mothballed 30 gigawatts of gaspowered plants in the last 20 months because the gas prices coming from Russia are so expensive that it is raising their electricity rates to such an extent that it is damaging the area. With our legislation. if those gas prices go up. an option available to the American people. to the American utility sector. is they can go out and build a coalpowered plant with reasonable regulations. Then the second thing that our legislation doesand when I say ""our."" I am talking about Senator JOE MANCHIN. a Democrat from West Virginia. has introduced this bill in the U.S. Senate. I. along with Democratic support. was able to get it out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. So this debate is vitally important today because the President is going so fast. in such an extreme way. that it would make it impossible to use coal in America with a new plant. and we have never had a national debate on the issue. So today we can at least have this debate. The second thing that our legislation does applies to existing plants. EPA said they are going to regulate existing coal plants. We say go ahead and do it. set the standards. but Congress will set the effective date for that regulation. It is a very simple piece of legislation. one that I think is necessary to protect the American people and to ensure that America remains competitive in the global marketplace. In addition to that. I want to make one other comment. Emissions from the energy sector in America are the lowest. C02 emissions are the lowest that they have been in 20 years. So America does not have to take a backseat to anyone on having a clean emission standard and regulation. With that. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130077660,Mr. Chair. I certainly have a great deal of respect for the gentlelady from California. and I might add. we have heard a lot today about climate change. Former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson. herself. stated in a hearing: We will not ultimately be able to change the amount of CO2 that is accumulating in the atmosphere alone. By that. she meant the United States. and there are a couple of reasons she said that. First of all. 96 percent of CO2 emissions are naturally occurring. manmade is around 4 percent. I might also point out that. in the recent fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. they acknowledged a lack of warming since 1998. and they acknowledged the growing discrepancy between their climate model projections versus actual readings. So it is not that people are denying. It is that there is a significant difference among the scientific community about what is manmade CO2 contributing and what is naturally occurring CO2. To the gentleladys amendment. the Premier of Saskatchewan was in my office today. talking about the Canadian project that the gentlewoman from California referred to. It is not in operation yet. He did say that it would not have been built without government funds. and her amendment would simply say that. if it is working in Canada. the EPA could apply that and make it mandatory here. We believe that the Energy Policy Act of 2005 made it illegal for EPA to even set the emissions standard that they have set in their proposed rule. and certainly. what the gentleladys amendment would allow is the governments to put in large sums of money to make some projects work that may not. in reality. be able to be accomplished in the U.S. because of a lack of private capital. So if technology is working in another country. it can be brought to America. and if it meets our standards set in paragraphs B and C. it would be able to be utilized. so for that reason. I would make the argument that the gentleladys amendment should be rejected. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130093573,"with regard to Rocky Flats in my district. which will help increase transparency to ensure that cold war nuclear workers will have their benefit applications reviewed expeditiously. There are many survivors in my district who have been exposed to radiation and who are suffering from severe health effects. If they had been on the military side. they would have been taken care of. They are on the civilian side. but have put their lives in harms way. and they deserve to be taken care of for their service to our country. I am also pleased with my amendment with Mr. BLUMENAUER. which would defund the midlife nuclear refueling and overhaul of the George Washington aircraft carrier. which would save $5 billion. The administration released a statement of administrative policy. expressing concern about this unneeded reoverhaul of an aircraft carrier that we do not need as we shrink our carrier fleet permanently to 10 vessels. Finally. I am pleased with my amendment with Representative NADLER. which is to encourage the Department of Defense to ensure that our groundbased missile defense systems actually work and that there are operational. realistic tests before additional purchases are made of systems that do not keep Americans safe. This will also be permitted on the floor of the House today. However. 131 ideasgood. bad. and otherfrom my colleagues on both side of the aisle are not even allowed to be debated or voted on under this bill. The single biggest issue. the pressing national issue of the ongoing war in which this Nation is engaged is not even able to have 10 minutes or 1 minute of floor debate. as it has that very same issue. the ongoing presence in Afghanistan. And I have my opinions. my colleague. Mr. MCGOVERN. has his. and folks on the other side and both sides of the aisle have theirs. This is not a partisan issue. It is simply one that we as representatives of the American people deserve to be able to be their voice on: How long and in what capacity should we continue to send American men and women to Afghanistan? The only way that we can ensure that this body is allowed to have their voiceDemocrats. Republicans. people who want us to stay there. people who dontis to bring down this rule and to bring forward a rule that allows a debate of the single most significant pressing national policy issue. In addition. there are a number of amendments around military preparedness and making sure our military has the very best and brightest aspiring Americans to draw from to keep our country safe that is not even allowed to be discussed under the rules of the bill. And finally. the USA FREEDOM Act. which is no longer the USA FREEDOM Act but a bill that has a loophole as wide as the Grand Canyon that was not in the original USA FREEDOM Act. passed on a bipartisan basis on a voice vote out of committee. and yet 20 amendmentsagain. good. bad. indifferent. some of which would have addressed the flawsnot even allowed 10 minutes. not allowed 1 minute. not allowed 30 seconds. not allowed 10 seconds. not allowed a vote. Why are we scared of letting the Members of this body. Republican and Democrat. have a voice in addressing the very legitimate privacy concerns about the NSA? If people think this bill will somehow address the concerns and they are gone. they are wrong. I plan on voting against this stripped version. which is no longer the USA FREEDOM Act. to show that it no longer even comes remotely close to addressing the concerns that my constituents have about the NSA overreach with regard to their privacy. We need to reject this rule to ensure that this body. representatives of the American people. Republican and Democratic. can bring forward the issues that pertain to national defense and our privacy. I urge my colleagues to vote ""no"" on the rule. and I yield back the balance of my time."
1130118258,Mr. Speaker. I am delighted that we have this bill on the floor today. I am going to confine my remarks to one piece of legislation. and that is the Electricity Security and Affordability Act. This legislation has passed the House before. and it is designed to do two things. One is to reverse the extreme regulations coming out of the EPA on existing coalfired plants and new coalfired plants. We all understand that the President of the United States views that the number one issue facing mankind today is climate change. and. while we all recognize that there is climate change. we do not view it as the most important issue facing man today. Because of the Presidents positionhis extreme viewshe is dictating to the EPA to take positions that are damaging the coal industry but. more important than the coal industry. damaging the electricity produced from coal. Now. what does that mean to the American people? Well. how many of you are aware that C02 emissions in America today are lower than they have been for 20 years? America does not have to take a backseat to any country in the world. And yet. this President. with his EPA. has passed regulations that make it impossible to build a new coal plant in America and in an amount that makes it commercially feasible to do. So here we are in America. doing a better job than any other country in the world. and yet this President. because of his extreme views. makes it impossible to build a new coal plant. Now. I would be the first to admit that a new coal plant is not going to be built in America because our natural gas prices are very low. We are fortunate. with the shale development. that gas prices are extremely low. But what if we find ourselves in the position that they found themselves in Europe? Gas prices coming from Russia are so high that they started mothballing their natural gas plants to produce electricity and started building new coal plants. and last year. they imported 53 percent of the coal exports from America. So. in Europe. they have that flexibility. But in America we dont have that flexibility. So. if gas prices go up. which they may very well do. then we cant build a new coal plant because it is too expensive and the technology is not there to meet the extreme. stringent emission standards set by EPA. So this legislation would stop that. and it would say. EPA. you can regulate C02 emissions. but you can build a new coal plant if you use the best available control technology. Now. what do we doyou know. next June EPA is coming out with a new regulation that. in effect. will federalize the electricitygenerating business in America for the first time. EPA is setting standard emission caps for every State in America. We already know that in Kentucky they have identified 15 coal units that will be closed down. And guess what? When they adopted this regulation. they did not do any thorough reliability studies. Now. we all recognize that renewables play an important role. but they cannot be the base load of electricity production in America. And if America is going to remain competitive in the global marketplace. we have to have lowcost. abundant. affordable. reliable electricity.
1130119464,informed me that there had been no updates from the administration that they have requested for 6 months. so for all we know. the President might be ready to approve or not approve this project tomorrow. next week. next monthI dont knowbut it seems like the two branches of government arent talking to one another. Normally. if Congress is interested in where a particular approval process is. we would hold hearings. and we would ask the relevant questionswhat are the current sticking points. are there issues that are still pendingrather than bypass any legitimate issues that might still be there around the routing. As many of you know. the routing has already been changed so as not to impact the Ogallala aquifer. and there could very well be other important issues that affect residents of the States through which the Keystone pipeline would pass. Clearly. this project is a great favor to our friendly neighbors to the north. the great nation of Canada. The question that we need to figure out as a country is: Does it benefit America? Does it benefit Americans? There are pros and cons. Obviously. if it goes in your neighborhood. it is not a particular benefit to youor through your farmand that was some of the issues that we heard from in the impact statements that are currently being reviewed by the administration. There is a review process underway. We all wish that review process went faster. We all wish that NEPA would go faster. We all wish that a wide variety of review policies would go faster. but we dont know how that is going to be concluded. and I think it is important that. while they get through it as soon as possible. they are able to do so and take all factors into account. If Congress wants to change the approval process for these kinds of projects. I think that is a legitimate discussion to have. If Congress determines it needs to reconfigure a review process for a project like this. maybe we would go into the statute and we alter the different agencies or we assign different responsibility or criteria. That would be a relevant discussion to have. not bypassing something that Congress set up in statute. The President is doing what Congress told him to do in reviewing this processnot this Congress. but the underlying statute when it was passed. Now. of course. there are a lot of issues around Keystone XL. and rather than interrupting the State Departments ongoing review process. Congress should allow all the relevant issues to be properly addressed around this issue. I want to emphasize that the Republicans brought this tar sands bill forward just one day after China and the U.S. came to a landmark agreement to address climate change. Tar sands are a highpolluting fuel that. on a lifecycle basis. tar sands crude produces about 20 percent more carbon pollution than conventional crudes. In addition. we have a study from Cornell University with regard to the effect of the XL pipeline on gasoline for American citizens. and top energy economists in this Cornell study said that if the XL pipeline is built. consumers in our country may end up paying 10 to 20 cents more per gallon for gas as a result of tar sands being diverted. That is millions of dollars a year out of the pockets of Americans and perhaps into the pockets of wherever all this oil is going. But. again. of what benefit to America is this project? There is also the simple matter of how a bill becomes a law. okay. so we have a House bill. a Senate bill. and lets take a wild presumption. maybe both Chambers will pass this bill. What happens next? It goes to the President. The President can sign a bill or veto a bill. Essentially. the President can sign a bill approving the Keystone pipeline. which is something that he can do now without this bill. He can approve the pipeline. and if Congress goes through all this deliberative effort at taxpayer expense. talk. and votes and all this stuff. the President still has a decision. Now. again. obviously. if there are twothirds in both Chambers. Congress can seize power on a particular issue and exert its own will. but that hasnt been the case on these Keystone pipeline votes. and I dont expect it to be the case on this one. So it is just an exercise in senseless hot air being thrown around the Chamber where we can pass bills and the same situation prevails if it passes or not. namely. the President can decide whether they want this to go forward or not. If Congress wants to alter that approval process. lets look at the statutory rules around how projects are reviewed for future projects and see if we can reach a bipartisan consensus about that. I wish that this had been an emergency piece of legislation. I wish that we were tackling a potential public health crisis. I wish that we were tackling terrorism. I wish we were tackling balancing the budget. and I wish we were tackling securing our borders. But we are not. We are tackling something that isnt going anywhere and. even if passed. will give the President the same choice that he has today. much to do about nothing. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130121608,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. President Obama has made it very clear that if the U.S. Congress does not pass legislation that he has said that is a priority for his administration. that he intends to accomplish his goals by the use of executive orders and through regulations. Today. with H.R. 4795. we are here to address a specific problem caused by regulations coming out of EPA relating to the Clean Air Act. We know that announcements have been made for manufacturing expansions in the United States amounting to about $135 billion. But we also know that EPA has gone into a pattern of when they issue new regulations. it takes them sometimes years to come up with guidances so that State EPAs and manufacturing applicants for clean air permits will know what is required to meet the new regulations. Because of the lack of clarity and the time of meeting timely guidances. it creates great confusion and uncertainty for the States and for the specific manufacturing facilities trying to meet these requirements. To give you an example. the last ozone rule that was adopted by the EPA in 2008. the guidance for people trying to meet those requirements of that regulation still have not been issued. So we find ourselves in a situation where these new regulations are creating great obstacles to economic growth in the United States. and I think all of us recognize that economic growth has been quite stagnant for some time. We have had many hearings on this issue. and we hear from people on a regular basis that one of the reasons that they cant get new plants built is because of the uncertainty. the lack of clarity. the lack of guidance from the EPA when they come out with new regulations. Anyone that follows EPA is quite aware that they are particularly aggressive in new regulations. They have come out with new regulations on the Clean Air Act on a regular basis for the last 4 years. And so once again we find ourselves with lack of clarity. lack of guidance from EPA. This legislation. which was introduced by Mr. SCALISE. simply says to EPA. if you come out with a new regulation. simultaneously you must provide the guidance for the States and the individual applicants who will be required to obtain permits to build their manufacturing facility. So that is what this bill is all about. I think it is a commonsense piece of legislation. and obviously all of us want to create new jobs. We have companies out there today with a lot of cash who want to produce these. build these new plants. but because of bureaucratic difficulties. lack of clarity. and lack of guidance on a timely basis from the EPA. it makes it extremely difficult to do. So that is why we are here today to discuss this legislation. I think it is very important that we adopt this legislation. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130121610,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I might say that during the time we had the hearing on this legislation. we had several State representatives from the State EPA come in and testify. and they all were talking about the absence of timely implementation guidance from EPA produces a lack of clarity. Both the Colorado. Arkansas. even the National Association of Clean Air Agencies wrote a letter to EPA on September 4. 2013. complaining about this. Now. I would remind everyone. this bill does not do anything about the science. trying to diminish the importance of science and coming forth with new regulations. All it does is says that if EPA comes out with a new regulation under the Clean Air Act. they must provide the guidance to the States and to the entities who want to build new plants. I might also say that the American Chemistry Council. particularly. raised this issue with usand through their membershipof companies trying to build new manufacturing plants and meeting great difficulty because of the lack of clarity. I might also say. all of us are very much concerned about climate change. but I dont think America has to take a backseat to any other country in the world. Our CO2 emissions are the lowest that they have been in 20 years. I might also say. we find ourselves today. because of regulations from this administration. being one of the only countries in the world where you cannot build a new coalfired plant to produce electricity because the technology is not available to meet the stringent emissions standard unless you are going to spend huge sums of government money. as they are in the Kemper plant in Mississippi. By the way. the standard was set for that regulation. the emission standard. based on the Kemper plant. which is still not in operation. It is about 2 years overdue. is way over cost. and all the entities involved in it said that kind of plant would never be built again without huge government dollars involved. We would like to get back to a situation in America where. on energy projects. we use private money. I notice that Google recently was involved in the Ivanpah Solar facility out west. one of the largest in the world. They used a lot of government loans to build that plant. and now Google and other companies are coming back to the government and applying for grants to help pay off the loans. So this is a commonsense piece of legislation. It does not change the science. it simply provides additional clarity. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.

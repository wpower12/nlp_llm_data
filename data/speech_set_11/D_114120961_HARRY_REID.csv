1140014860,Mr. President. I rise to honor the 60th anniversary of Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas. NV. In 1954. Bishop Gorman High School opened as the first Catholic high school in Southern Nevada. I congratulate the institution on 60 years of leading our country in firstrate education while positively implementing Catholic values. Bishop Gorman High School has graduated more than 9.000 students and currently has a 100 percent graduation rate and a college bound rate of 96 percent. making Bishop Gorman a national leader in college preparatory education. The school is equipped with an impressively experienced and credited faculty. with nearly 70 percent holding advanced degrees. The administration and the facultys dedication to providing excellent education in a Catholic setting. in addition to a low studentteacher ratio. has contributed to Bishop Gormans success and helped ensure that its students can reach their full potential. The school takes pride in providing its students with a wellrounded education that includes strong academic principles. faith. and competitive athletic opportunities. Over the past 60 years. students have won 97 State athletic championships and received State and national recognition in academics. fine arts. and extracurricular activities. Bishop Gorman High School also gives back to the local community and the State. Every year they organize multiple service events. and this past year. art students designed a beautiful courtyard for a transitional home in Las Vegas. Additionally. the National Honor Society students volunteered each week at a local food bank. I applaud Bishop Gorman High School President John Kilduff and Principal Kevin Kiefer for their strong leadership and recognize this years Knight of the Gaels honoree. Jack Raftery. Sr. I am pleased that through your joint efforts and the dedication of those before you. this remarkable institution has been a part of our community for 60 years. Best wishes for continued success. and congratulations on this great achievement.
1140027419,Mr. President. 2 years ago the American people first became aware that the National Security Agency was collecting private information about their phone calls. This is called the Snowden revelation. Under the banner of national security. the National Security Agency was mining information about home phone calls and how long they lasted. They found out whom they were callingand not only that. They found out whom the call was between. They also determined how long that call lasted. NSA essentially was conducting a dragnet. without first attempting to determine whether that information was relevant to a national security problem. NSA ran this program under the authorities granted to them by section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. which expires on June 1 of this year. The American people were outraged by these revelations and Congress rightly acted. Last year. the House passed a bill by a vote of 303 to 121 to end the NSAs socalled bulk metadata collection program and reform and extend the authority for this program. I brought a similar bill to the floor authored by Senators LEAHY and LEE. There was a bipartisan group of Senators who joined them to call for its passage. But sadly. the majority leaderat that time the minority leaderstood in the way of bipartisan reform. Instead of passing meaningful reform. he led a Republican filibuster of this bill. That was one of a couple hundred that was led by my friend. This year. Senators LEAHY and LEE worked again with the Chairman and ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee on the USA FREEDOM Act. which ends the National Security Agencys bulk collection program and extends and reforms the authorities under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. There have been bipartisan and bicameral calls for the Senate to take up that legislation. Yet again. instead of committing to bringing up this bipartisan bill. last month the senior Senator from Kentucky introduced a bill that would extend the authorities for the National Security Agencys bulk collection program for 51/2 years. Then the Second Circuit. almost simultaneouslywithin 24 hours of that decision by the majority leaderfound the bulk collection illegal. In reaction to the courts decision. the House last week passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 338 to 88. By a fourtoone margin. the House voted to end the National Security Agencys illegal bulk data collection program and reform its practices. But even in the face of that courts decision. the majority leader stood once again against bipartisan reform. Instead of heeding the Republicancontrolled Houses calls for reform. the majority leader introduced a bill that would extend the authorities for the National Security Agencys illegal program for 2 more months. Congressman GOODLATTE. the chair of the Judiciary Committee in the House. said they will not accept a shortterm extension of the bill. This morning. Leader MCCARTHY. the second ranking Republican in the House. said they will not accept any extension. That is exactly what the Speaker. Congressman BOEHNER. said. If we squander this opportunity to deliver sound reforms to this illegal program. we are handling our duties irresponsibly here in the Senate. To stand in the way of reforming these practices is to ignore the voice of the American people. Just yesterday. a new poll commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union showed that 82 percent of Americans are concerned that the Federal Government is collecting and storing the personal information of Americans. and they do not like it. If we are unable to reform these practices. we are ignoring the ruling of the Second Circuit. which rejected the National Security Agencys bulk collection program. and we are not allowing the American peoples voice to be heard. I think. most importantly. if the senior Senator from Kentucky does not allow this commonsense reform simply with a vote on the Senate floor about what happened in the House. they are ignoring the rare bipartisan support that we have. Just last week. 190 House Republicans voted to end the National Security Agencys illegal program. There is bipartisan consensus in favor of ending this program. Many of the Republican leaders own colleagues have called for it as well. Last week. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and James Clapper. Director of National Intelligence. wrote a letter to Senator LEAHY. the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence voiced their support for the USA FREEDOM Act. saying: Overall. the significant reforms contained in this legislation will provide the public greater confidence in how our intelligence activities are carried out and in the oversight of those activities. while ensuring vital national security authorities remain in place. I agree with that statement. But sadly. the majority leader continues to stand in the way of bipartisan reform to end these illegal practices. As we face the June 1 expiration of these authorities. the majority leader still offers no viable alternative. We cannot allow this program to be extended. The majority leader should listen to the American people because we cannot extend an illegal act. That is what the majority leader is asking us to do. The majority leader should listen to the American people. consider the action of his Republican colleagues. and respect the expertise of the intelligence community. The Senate should act now on the USA FREEDOM Act before it leaves for the Memorial Day recess and restore the confidence of the American people.
1140032600,"Madam President. a few days ago. the majority leader was reported to have declared to a conservative talkradio show that under his leadership. the Republican Senate will shirk its constitutional duties by not continuing to confirm judgesperiod. He went on to say: We may confirm a few that come from States where only Republicans give the President the names. but other than that. we are going to do none. I assume this is accurate. I hope it is not. but I assume that it is. It would be a very stunning and disappointing declaration that the senior Senator from Kentucky. especially since he argued for the fair consideration of President Bushs court nominees. would now switch his position. In July of 2008. here is what he said: ""Even with lameduck Presidents. there is a historical standard of fairness as to confirming judicial nominees. especially circuit court nominees."" That is a direct quote from the majority leader. These are his words. Not a single word has been made up. That is what he said: ""Even with lameduck presidents. there is a historical standard of fairness as to confirming judicial nominees. especially circuit court nominees."" And the record is spread with many quotes he has given just the same. He also said in that same year: ""No party is without blame in the confirmation process. but what is going on nowor. more accurately. what is not going onis yet another step backward in politicizing the confirmation processsomething we had all hoped that we would get beyond."" Earlier my friend from Kentucky said: ""Judicial nominations need to be treated fairly and commitments need to be kept."" And even earlier than that. here is what he said: ""On the issue of judicial confirmations. the majority leader and I discussed this matter publicly at the beginning of the Congress""-he is saying that he and I are talking-""and we agreed that President Bush. in the last 2 years of his term. should be treated as well as President Reagan. Bush 41. and President Clinton were treated in the last 2 years of their tenures in office because there was one common thread. and that was that the Senate was controlled by the opposition party."" So what he is saying there is that what he wanted was for Bush to be treated the same way that Bush 1. President Reagan. and President Clinton had been treated. He got that with large numbers of judges being appointed. So we are here now with the statements ringing loudly that the majority leader is intent on writing off the Senates constitutional duty of offering our advice and consent now that President Obama is nominating individuals to the Federal bench. The Republican leader is a student of the Senate. He says he is. and I believe that. I am confident that he understands that the Senate cannot and should not neglect the constitutional obligations we have. The Senate cannot simply ignore critical vacancies in the last 2 years of any Presidents termwhat a bad standard to set. especially with the growth in certain communities. We have a number of judicial emergencies that have been determined. It is all the more troubling that the majority leader wants to pick an unnecessary fight over judges just as Republican Senators are working with the President to fill vacancies in their States. The majority leader is essentially telling other Senators that their judicial recommendations simply dont matterDemocrats. Independents. Republicans. The majority leader is telling the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that regardless of the judicial nominations his committee continues to report out. they could be blocked on the Senate floor. But I do say this just as a caveat: The present Judiciary Committee is doing the same thing that was done by the present chairman of the Finance Committee when he was chair of the Judiciary Committee. He didnt have to worry about a lot of names on the calendar because he simply held no hearings in the Judiciary Committee. The same situation is prevailing now. So we dont have a lot of people on the calendar because they are not having any hearings to speak of in the Judiciary Committee. I have spoken here on the floor before about the nomination of Felipe Restrepo for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. After repeated. repeated. and repeated delays. the committee is finally considering his nomination on Wednesday. He has been waiting for months. This is an incredibly qualified nominee who enjoys vast bipartisan support. including both Pennsylvania Senators. one a Democrat and one a Republican. The Republican Senator from Pennsylvania has said that Judge Restrepo would be a ""superb addition to the Third Circuit."" In that case we have waited months to even have a hearing. So it must have been shocking for the junior Senator from Pennsylvania to learn that his judicial pick would face another delaya delay indefinitely. perhaps. This is a blatant rejection of the Senates constitutional duties. Just as Senator MCCONNELL argued for fairness for President Bushs nominations. it is not unreasonable for Democrats to expect that same measure of fairness that President Bush got in the 110th Congress. Regardless of whether a State had two Democrats. two Republicans or a split delegation. Senate Democrats brought President Bushs nominees up for a vote. By this point in the seventh year of George W. Bushs Presidency. Senate Democrats confirmed 18 judges. including 3 circuit court judges. In almost 6 months. the Republican Senate has only confirmed four district court judges. To put this in perspective. during the Presidency of Bush. we confirmed four in 1 month. So perhaps the majority leaders comments about a judicial slowdown were just confirming what he has already done to block the Presidents nominees. I repeat. The committee is being run the same way that the present chair of the Finance Committee did when he was chair of the Judiciary Committeejust holding no hearings. That way. there is nobody on the calendaror very few. The Republican Senate hasnt confirmed even a single circuit court judgenot even a consensus nominee such as Kara Stoll to the Federal Circuit. She was reported out of committee by a voice vote in April. Nothing so farthey are not even having hearings. I repeat. on most nominees. Therefore. there is no one to report to the floor. Actions speak louder than words. and the majority leader can demonstrate that his remarks were misinterpretedand I would certainly hope soby scheduling a prompt vote on the Stoll nomination. We should schedule a vote on her nomination no later than this week. Kara Stoll is the only appeals court judge awaiting a vote before the Senate. For the reasons I have just said. people have been in the pipeline. but they wont hold hearings. Both of these nominationsRestrepo and Stollneed a vote now. Lets hope the majority leader will reflect upon his past statements about fair consideration of judicial nominees. in comparison to what he said on a talk showI guess appealing to the rightwing even more than what has happened recently. and that is quite a bit. Lets hope he does not treat judicial nominees as they have never been treated before. Lets hope that the Senate will quickly confirm at least these two qualified judges. We need a lot more. but these two would be a step in the right direction. I note there is no one on the floor. and I ask that the Chair announce the business of the day."
1140072293,"Mr. President. in less than 300 days. the American people will head to the polls to elect the President of the United States. An election year places the state of our Union under intense scrutiny. At this time it is important to remember just how far we have come through the leadership of President Barack Obama. I can remember the first time I heard Barack Obamas name. I was in the House gym. where I worked out for many years. Former Members have a little room in the back. Abner Mikvalongtime Congressman from Illinois. top lawyer for President Clinton. appellate court judge. and has had quite a remarkable career himselfwas there. While we were getting dressed. he said to me: We have a Senate race in Illinois. And I asked: Well. whom are you supporting? He said: Barack Obama. I thought he was trying to be funny. Barack Obama? Come on. That is basically what I said to him. but I was wrong and he was right. This man with the unusual name was elected President of the United States. It is important to remember just how far we have come through his leadership. After 8 years of disaster under President Bush. the American people embraced President Obamas message of hope and change. On January 20. 2009. Barack Obama became the first AfricanAmerican President in the history of our country. Instead of working with the President to repair our economy. strengthen the middle class. and help working families. Republicans have chosen a path. for 7 years. of relentless obstruction. In fact. during the Presidents first term. the Republican leader publicly said: ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a oneterm President."" As we look back over 7 years of the Obama Presidency. one thing is clear: Republicans have failed in their radical crusade against him. President Obama inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression. He acted immediately to address the economic crisis and begin rebuilding our economy. Because of President Obama. our economy has fought back from the brink of destruction. which is what it really was. Last month. record car sales were announced for the year 2015. How did it come about? Because President Obama went against the Republicans every step of the way by saving Chrysler and GM and giving Ford a great boost. The most significant car and truck sales in the history of our country occurred last year. Millions of Americans now have health care. The President made sure he fulfilled his promise of getting Osama bin Laden. and he did. He was killed. The President has taken bold action to address our broken immigration system. doubled our countrys production of renewable energy. and expanded access to higher education for millions of Americans. I have a lot of affection and admiration for President Obama and most everyone knows that. I have had the good fortune of working with him for the past 9 years in the Senate and as President. His rescuing the Nation from crisis. his bold legislative achievement. and his refusal to back down in the face of Republican obstruction have made him one of the best Presidents of all time. No State was hit harder by the recession and foreclosure crisis than Nevada. President Obama provided the resources necessary to stabilize the shattered housing markets. keep responsible borrowers in their homes. and reduce foreclosures. Through the efforts he made. the President and his administration were able to provide about $200 million to Nevadas hardest hit homes. and there were lots of them. It didnt take care of all the problems. but it certainly helped a great deal. These were programs that provided unemployed and underemployed homeowners financial assistance. Nevadas unemployment rate reached almost 14 percent. Across the country. the rate of unemployment was about 10 percent. Today we have seen over 70 consecutive months of job growth. and our economy has added more than 14 million private sector jobs during the Obama years. Keep in mind what was happening during the last months of the Bush administration. During the first 2 months after the President was elected but not sworn into office. 800.000 jobs were lost 2 months in a row. It is hard to comprehend that. but that is what happened. Now we have seen the evidence of our Nations job market continuing to bounce back. Last week alone almost 300.000 jobs were announced in the preceding month of December. A recent report shows that businesses have added 5.6 million jobs in the last 2 years alone. the most since the end of the Clinton administration. This certainly wouldnt have been possible without President Obamas leadership. Nevadas unemployment rate. which I have already mentioned. was the worst in the Nation. We had an ongoing struggle with the State of Rhode Island for years as to which had the worst unemploymentRhode Island or Nevada. Neither State wanted to win. but we both won on many occasions as to which had the highest unemployment rate. Thanks to President Obamas leadership. we are finally coming back in a very strong way. In December. the President signed a tax bill that includes one of the biggest antipoverty tools in a generation. It will help lift 16 million modest- and lowincome working families out of poverty. including 8 million children. Renewable energy is taking off like never before as a result of that legislation. President Obama and Senate Democrats have brought our economy back from the brink of destruction. I have already talked about the auto industry. We took on Wall Street to ensure that the greed and corruption which produced the great recession would never happen again. Republicans said no at every turn. but we succeeded in spite of their obstruction. Health care. Before President Obama took office. tens of millions of Americans were denied health insurance. Thanks to the hard work of President Obama and the Democrats in Congress. the Affordable Care Act has banned insurance company discrimination. requiring coverage without regard to preexisting conditions or health status. That is just a little bit of what has been done. Since the law took effect. 17 million uninsured Americans have now gained insurance coverage. The success of ObamaCare is undeniable and made health care available to millions. slowed the rate of health care cost growth. and it did not cause any of the horrible problems that were talked about. prophesied. and that were suggested would happen by Republicans. In effect. what they said was all wrong. Immigration. Immigration was a problem before President Obama took office. but he tried to do something about it. and of course Republicans blocked that also. At the State of the Union Address 2 years ago. he said: I worked with you. I have tried. I have pleaded. and I am tired of doing this. I will have to do things on my own now because you will not do it legislatively. And he has done that. We failed to pass the DREAM Act in 2010. President Obama acted to protect DREAMers. by announcing DACA. deferred action for childhood arrivals. To date. almost 700.000 young individuals have been protected from deportation. Since then. Democrats led the charge for comprehensive immigration reform to fix our Nations broken immigration system. The Senate passed bipartisan immigration reform in 2013. which was important. but we now have people. such as the junior Senator from Florida. for example. who helped pass that legislation. but once he started running for national office decided that everything he did in bringing that bill to the Senate floor was wrong. and he has taken a 360degree turn and said: I did all of that. but I guess I was wrong. We havent been able to get it out of the House. and now we have people such as the junior Senator from Florida who is denigrating his own bill. President Obama acted within his legal Executive authority to unite American families and strengthen our immigration system. including protecting some adults with children in the United States from deportation. It is a longer story than that. but that is the short story. Energy and the environment. Climate change is one of the greatest. if not the greatest threat. the world has ever known. Because of President Obamas leadership. the world is on track to keep temperatures from rising and avoid the most catastrophic impact of climate change. By negotiating the historic Paris climate agreement. the President has crafted a version of clean energy and climate change for our country by establishing carbon emission standards on vehicles that help consumers save money on fuel for the first time by limiting carbon pollution from powerplants. He established or expanded 19 national monuments. Why? Because Republicansbills we passed matteroffactually herealways refused to allow us to have votes on them. So he moved forward. as he said he would do. with an Executive action for 19 national monuments. In Nevada. it includes the 750.000 acres of the Basin and Range National Monument. which is something that is great and all Americans can share. The President believes these lands belong to all Americans and that our children and grandchildren should be able to enjoy the beauty and bounty of our country. Education. When President Obama took office. our Nations education system was in desperate need of reform. No Child Left Behind crippled schools around the country and graduation rates were at historic lows. One of the most important actions President Obama took through the recovery act was nearly $100 billion in aid for K12 and higher education. Today students across the country have made tremendous progress. More students have graduated than ever before. particularly lowincome and minority students. President Obama also took historic steps to address extreme levels of student debt in this country. By working with Democrats. President Obama created new programs to help college graduates manage their student debt by capping their loan payments by 10 percent of their income. We wanted to do more. but obstruction raised its ugly head and Republicans refused to allow us to do even more. Guns. Mass murders have taken place all over. and Nevada is no exception. It has happened there also. From the time he was elected President. Republicans have tried every means possible by working arm in arm and hand in hand with the NRA to stop everything the President has tried to accomplish. Even though more than 80 percent of the American people said there should be background checks for people who are crazy and criminals. it is not good enough for Republicans. They have still stopped us. The President tried to work with Republicans and they have refused. This has brought about his new efforts to use Executive action. Last week he did just that. He addressed the epidemic of gun violence in this country through legal Executive action. Republicans have blocked this action. even in the wake of coldblooded mass murders in schools. houses of worship. movie theaters. and many other places. Tomorrow the President will deliver his final State of the Union Address to the American people. I look forward to hearing ways in which he plans to continue and push our Nation forward during his last year in office. We will do everything in our power. as Democrats. to build on the strong legacy President Obama has established. We will continue to fight to strengthen the middle class and working families by addressing the mountain of student debt that saddles Americans higher education. We will continue fighting to increase the minimum wage. We will not rest until wages of women match the wages of their male counterparts. and we will continue to keep Wall Street accountable by prioritizing Main Street and protecting the good work the DoddFrank legislation did. As we begin this legislative session. I hope we will find in our Republicans a willing partner to protect and strengthen our Nation. I hope it is not wishful thinking. but it probably is. We stand ready to work with our Republican colleagues to do what is right for the American people."
1140089374,"Mr. President. imagine though. if you will. that this great country is facing a potential outbreak of a dangerous virus. It is nothing that was made up in the movies. nothing that is on a special TV show. It is actually a potential outbreak of a dangerous virus. Imagine. mosquitoes are carrying a virus that affects pregnant women. a virus that causes birth defects in babies. not allowing their brains and skulls to develop. The skulls collapse on a number of them. Brains dont develop. It is a virus that can cause men and women to develop nervous system disorders that can result in paralysis. We dont know the full extent of this. We had a briefing here a week ago today with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. We had the Secretary of Health and Human Services here. They are in a state of emergency. They need to do something. They need to develop a vaccine. This is on its way. It is here. It is here in Puerto Rico. We have cases reported in the State of my friend. Florida. He is someone with whom I have served in the House and in the Senate. Senator NELSON of Florida is one of our very outstanding Members. We already know there are cases in Florida. Thirty States are going to be affected with these mosquitoes as the weather warms. I have been told in the past that mosquitoes have never caused birth defects. They have caused all kinds of problems with malaria and other things. but not birth defects. Now they are here. Imagine. after what I have just laid out to you. that those in control of Congress do nothing to address the imminent danger posed by this virus. It sounds like some science fiction novel. doesnt it? But it is not. This is real life in America. This is the realitythe Republicans refusal to respond to the threat of Zika. My friend mentioned that the senior Senator from Washington is involved in trying to come up with something for Zika. She said yesterday she hasnt heard a word from the Republicans in more than a week on this important issue. This is real life. Zika is a scourge that is already affecting our country. as I have outlined. It is time we pass an emergency appropriations bill to take care of it. to fight it. Out of tradition. common sense. and precedent. a public health threat is an emergency. and it demands a response. As I indicated. hundreds of people in Puerto Ricoquickly approaching a thousandare infected. As the weather warms. as I have indicated. it is going to multiply throughout the continental United States. Thirty States will likely be affected with this mosquitothis killer mosquito. More than 2 months ago my friend said: We need more from the administration. More than 2 months ago the administrationdesperate as they weresent a letter to Congress saying we need an emergency request of $1.9 billionout of desperation. What did the White House do? Two years ago we were fighting Ebola. It is still a serious worldwide problem and a problem for our country. They had to take money from vaccines they were working on for Ebola and other things and start doing Zika. Now we have a situation where both the mosquitocaused Zika and the Ebola scourge are underfunded now. Republicans have done a double whammy here. We need to give the money back to the agencies that are doing something to help Ebola and fund Zika. They havent lifted a finger that we are aware of. As I said yesterday. the senior Senator from Washington hasnt heard from the socalled negotiators in more than a week. They refuse to do anything. even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health are pleading for us to act. They have been very clear about the funding they need to fight Zika. They are not making up things. They have told us in line and verse. My friend. the Republican leader said: We need more from the administration. It wasnt all that long ago that my friend the Republican leader was singing a much different song. This is what he said about funding the outbreak of Ebola 2 years ago. and it is a direct quote: I think they should have anything they want. . . . Whatever the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] thinks they need. well give it to them. He said the same thing 7 years ago when we were faced with another real problem. swine flu. This is what he said then: ""So if [the Administration] needs anything additionally from Congress. I know well be happy to provide it on a totally bipartisan basis."" Fast forward 7 years. and the Republicans now in the majority wont provide the requested funding for Zika. Why? We know why. They cant get it through over here. They cant get it done. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health know what they need. They have told us. They told anyone who will listen. So why cant the Republicans give it to them. If they wont give the experts the resources they need to combat Zika. what do they propose? We could ask the Zikacarrying mosquitoes: Dont breed this year. Remember. anyway. that it is in the last term of a twoterm President. Maybe we shouldnt do it this year. The Senate should not leave today without addressing this serious issue. We shouldnt be taking 10 days off as a dangerous virus threatens this Nationand it is threatening us. The Republicans should do their job and pass a $1.9 billion emergency spending bill to help protect Americans from the Zika virus."
1140091466,"Mr. President. today the Republican Presidential nomineeit is hard for me to say these wordsDonald Trump. comes to Capitol Hill. He secured the partys nomination. He did that last week. Donald Trump will meet privately today with Speaker RYAN and Republican Leader MCCONNELL. It is just the latest sign that Republican leaders in both Houses are marching lockstep with Donald Trump. Senator MCCONNELL has fully embraced Donald Trump. He said last week when Trump secured the nomination: ""I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters."" While speaking with reporters earlier this week. the Republican leader sounded enthusiastic about Trumps chances in the general election. I guess he should be giddy about a Trump Presidency. Donald Trump is everything the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nomination. Trumps policy decisions are identical to the Republican Party platform. Today. when they meet in an hour or two. Senator MCCONNELL can discuss that consensus with Trump. Lets talk about the Supreme Court. Donald Trump and the Senator from Kentucky can talk about their obstructionfor the first time in the history of the countryto a Presidential Supreme Court nomination. It has never happened before. We have had some stalling and a couple of filibusters. but this is one where people didnt want to meet with him. A few of them have broken from that. They certainly dont want to have a hearing. and they dont want to vote. It was Trump who said Republicans should ""delay. delay. delay"" filling the Supreme Court vacancy. Following Trumps lead. the Republican leader has personally overseen the blockade of Judge Garlands nomination. forcing Senators to fall in line. Lets talk about Trump and women. When they get together they can talk about their policy about being antiwoman. Since Senator MCCONNELL has so enthusiastically embraced Trump. we can only assume he agrees with Trumps view that women are dogs and pigs. We can only assume that the Republican leader is not repulsed by Donald Trumps vulgar behavior towards women. Look at the New York Times story yesterday with his cavorting with Howard Stern and how they talked about women. After all. the Republican Party has spent years blocking every substantive bill for American womenequal pay for equal work. This Republican Senate has undermined womens health at every turn. trying to turn Planned Parenthood into a punching bageven though millions and millions of American women have been helped by Planned Parenthood. They will have an opportunity this morning to talk about the antiLatino vote. They can discuss their antiimmigrant policies and their agenda. Since the Republican leader is all in for Donald Trump. we can only assume that he approves of Trumps calling immigrants rapists and murderers. and the DREAMers as being mules for drug dealing. I assume they can have a long discussion about the wallhow high it should be. how they are going to get the Mexicans to pay for the walleven though most people think the idea is insane. Lets not forget Republicans have demagogued Latinos and immigrants for decades. They are doing it today. The Republican leader voted against comprehensive immigration reform. Under Senator MCCONNELLS leadership. Senate Republicans almost came within hours of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security because of President Obamas executive actions on immigration. They can talk about their outlook on families. Donald Trump and the Republican leader can mention how little they have done for American families. Except now. in todays news. they are going to cut Medicaid and Medicare. I guess that is because he is getting lined up for the meeting with PAUL RYAN. because that is his No. 1 issue. Since the Republican leader has firmly established himself in Donald Trumps corner. one can only assume he is OK with Trumps shady business practices. He doesnt mind that Donald Trump rips off hardworking Americans. filed bankruptcy many. many times. and has a university that is corrupt. And the trial will go forward during the election. Sadly. a disregard for the middle class is an alltoofamiliar position for todays Republicans. The Republican Party refuses to address the minimum wage. college affordability. or any other legislation that helps families. Here is a doozy. They can spend a lot of time talking about climate change. Trump and the Republican leader can. in this private conversation. talk about denial of climate change. But 97 percent of all scientists worldwide believe it is here. It is upon us. Ask the senior Senator from Florida. He will tell you it is here. Look at what is happening in Miami. You can talk to the Senators from Virginia. and they will tell you what is happening in military bases on the coast of Virginia. Donald Trumps highest ranking supporter in Congress. Senator MCCONNELL. assumingly agrees with Trump that climate change is a hoaxhere is what Trump saidperpetrated by Chinese manufacturers. That position fits with a Republican Party that refuses to acknowledge the environmental and national security threats posed by climate change. If elected. Trump and Senator MCCONNELL would lead the nation backward on a climate change denial agenda that would put polluters first and make the United States the laughingstock of the world. More than 170 countries have agreed to address climate change because of U.S. leadership. but Trump and MCCONNELL have stated publicly that they will walk away from this. Lets talk about what Republicans like to talk aboutwhat is happening with the economykeeping in mind that Bill Clinton balanced the budget. Keep in mind that when George Bush came to the Presidency. there was a $7 trillion surplus over 10 years. With two wars unpaid for costing trillions of dollars and with tax cuts not being paid for. that surplus has long since gone. So they can talk about that. They can talk about how Trump has said that he thinks America should default on its debt. Just get the people we owe money to take less money. That is what he said. He doesnt want to pay our national debt. It seems that. on that issue. there is little distance between him and the Republican leader. Senator MCCONNELL has presided over a Republican caucus that has taken America to the brink of default on a number of occasions. not the least of which is shutting down the governmentthis great governmentshutting it down for 17 daysclosed. out of business. So Donald Trump and the Republican leadership should have a long. long conversation. They have a lot to talk about. At some point in the conversation. Donald Trump should thank the senior Senator from Kentucky. Trump owes his candidacy to the Republican leader and the policies he has led. It was the obstructionist. antiwoman. antiLatino. antiMuslim. antimiddleclass. antienvironment. antiObama. antieverything Republican Party during the last 8 years that has made Donald Trump a reality. I note that no one is on the floor. Will the Chair announce what the Senate is going to do this morning."
1140092050,"Madam President. what we know today is that the Zika virus was first discovered in 1947 in Uganda. It was first detected in monkeys. but in 1947 they also learned that the mosquito was now carrying this same virus the monkeys had. Initially. we didnt know or hear much about Zika. But we have heard plenty now. and we are going to hear a lot more. Researchers named the virus Zika because that is where the mosquito carrying the virus was discovered. in the Zika Forest of Uganda. as I mentioned. The Ugandan term ""zika"" means ""overgrown."" So these mosquitoes with this virus were discovered in an overgrown forest in Uganda. Now. seven decades later. Zika is an international emergency. and countries are scrambling to address the problems created by this mosquito that bites. What I have learned is that there is more than one type of mosquito. there are two. Already Zikacarrying mosquitoes have transmitted the disease to American citizens in Puerto Rico and other United States territories. Soon. mosquitoes carrying this virus will be biting and infecting people in the continental United States. That is not hyperbole. It is going to happen. Zikacarrying mosquitoes wont be limited to the gulf coast. Madam President. look at this map. You cant see it very well on this. but you can see the discoloration here. the original coloring that we have. We have the blue. and we have the orange and the gray. Now. I was really surprised. I thought this would really be in the subtropical climates here in the United States. in the southern part of our country. I thought that is where it would be. but you can see that is not the case. Nevada is here. and Las Vegas is here. There are over 2 million people living there. It is all over the United States. Boulder. CO. is up here. Puerto Rico and Hawaii are here. This map is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. and it shows the estimated range of the two types of Zikacarrying mosquitoes. Areas of this map. as I have indicated. are three in color and cover 39 States. Most of these States. as I have indicated. dont have subtropical weather. Nevada. Colorado. Wisconsin. Ohio. Kentucky. New Hampshire. and Maine are listed. Health officials are desperate to stop Zika. this devastating virus that has been around so long but it was not known to carry all the many problems it now carries. It causes birth defects and other deadly conditions. Last week. a report on NPR described what Zika does to the brain as it begins to grow. This is one condition: As the brain . . . starts to grow. it creates pressure. which pushes on the skull and causes it to grow. But if something stops brain growthsuch as [the Zika] viruspressure on the skull drops. And the skull can collapse down onto the brain. Two weeks ago we had people come to explain this to my caucus. and they described these skulls that just collapse. But Zika isnt only linked to birth defects. As I have indicated. the virus is also associated with a nervous system disorder that can result in paralysis. among other problems. Yet. in spite of all the devastating impacts of Zika. I am sorry to say. the Republicans in Congress dont see this virus as an urgent issue. Months ago. President Obama requested almost $2 billion to fight Zika. and for the same months the Republicans have refused to give the money America needs to fight this crisis. The best time to deal with any crisis is before it is here. but Republicans have dragged their feet. We should have passed an emergency spending bill months agomonths ago. We need to address Zika in the territories and give States and local governments the resources they are begging for. Last Thursday. appropriators filed an amendment that would provide $1.1 billion in Zika funding. That simply is not enough. This isnt about negotiating an arbitrary number made up by lawmakers. Our public health officials have made it clear they need that money. Senate Republicans are giving our government half of what it needs to fight this ravaging virus. This is beyond reckless. House Republicans are even doing less. The chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations last week said that Republicans are working on a Zika funding measure. but what House Republicans are proposing is even less than about half of the already low $1.1 billion amendment from Senate appropriators. Republicans are trying to haggle as if this is some sort of bidding war. That is not how Congress should react to a potentially disastrous health crisis. We know what is going on in Puerto Rico. We know. Because of Republicans refusal to lift a finger to help fight the Zika crisis. the administration was forced to use Ebola funds in order to fight Zika now. They had to take about $510 million that was set aside specifically for Ebola. Two years ago. America was afraid of Ebola. Ebola is still a killer. and we invested in supporting public health infrastructures to prevent future outbreaks like the one we saw. as I indicated. 2 years ago. We need to replenish these monies so we can continue to work on vaccines and other things. but Republicans are standing in the way. It is really a sad commentary on Republicans that when asked for emergency funding to protect millions of Americans. they respond by offering half of what is needed. This is in a spending bill. and then we have to go to the House and have a conference. In the meantime. people are begging for this money. Republicans should be ashamed that we arent doing everything in our power to protect the American people from this virus now. We should have an emergency spending bill on the floor now. If it were a flood or a fire that occurred. we would have been here. It is just too bad because this is a crisis that is already here. It is not an emerging crisis. It is here. Madam President. last week. the Republican leader came to the floor and here is what he said: ""We have elections in this country right on time. and that is not an excuse not to do our work."" Again: ""We have elections in this country right on time. and that is not an excuse not to do our work."" That is what Senator MCCONNELL said. So I say to my friend from Kentucky: I agree. Elections are no excuse not to do our work. So Senate Republicans should do their job and give Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. There is clearly no question that Merrick Garland is experienced and qualified to be a nominee. He is the nominee. and he has the expertise to go along with what a Supreme Court nominee should have. Throughout his decades as a prosecutor and judge. Mr. Garland has proven himself to be committed to the rule of law and following it. That is more than I can say for my Republican colleagues who. by refusing to consider this nominee. are rejecting their constitutional duties. The Republican leader needs to practice what he preaches. He says that elections shouldnt interfere with our Senate duties. He should prove it. The Republican Senators should prove that. Put aside Presidential elections. put aside Donald Trump. put aside all the phony excuses. and give Merrick Garland the consideration he deserves. Study Judge Garlands questionnaire. it is here. Analyze his record. it is here. Give him a hearing and send his nomination to the floor now. As the Republican leader put it. ""We have elections in this country right on time. and that is not an excuse not to do our work."" That is absolutely right. I would ask the Republicans to do their job. Madam President. on the Zika matter. I would add the following: ""The news from the House virtually guarantees that the Republican Congress will provide too little aid. too late to address the looming Zika crisis."" The way things are going around here. the appropriations bills are not going to be finished until right before the end of this fiscal year. late September. The crisis will long have arrived and we will be talking about cases that exist in the continental United States. It is wrong to wait. I dont see anyone here on the floor. so I would ask the Chair to announce the business of the day."
1140103587,Mr. President. yesterday marked 20 years since the devastating bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. This horrifying and evil act killed 19 U.S. airmen and wounded 400 others. 250 of whom were American. The Khobar Towers were part of a housing complex where American. British. and French troops lived. The complex housed nearly 2.000 military members. The night of the attack. U.S. Air Force SSGT Alfred Guerrero was on patrol and witnessed a gasoline truck drive up to the complex perimeter fence. The driver parked the gasoline truck and then immediately sprinted to the waiting vehicle where he met two other assailants who were acting as lookouts. The car then sped off. Sergeant Guerrero only had a few moments to respond. but tried bravely to begin an evacuation of the building. Tragically. there was not enough time before the truck bomb exploded. A member of my U.S. Capitol Police security detail. Special Agent Steve Sterling. was in an adjacent building when the attack took place. Steve. an airman first class at the time. was in the lobby of his building. making a call to the United States. when the blast erupted. He was thrown from his seat. but protected from further damage by the plywood boards surrounding the phone booth. Every other person in the lobby of his building was cut and bleeding from the debris and broken shards of glass. Later. Steve learned that four of his coworkers. whom he had just left only moments prior. were severely injured. After waiting a few seconds to get their bearings. Steve and the other servicemembers who suffered only minor injuries rushed to the blast site. They were shocked to see the entire face of building No. 131 completely ripped off. Immediately. Steve and others started pulling people from the fallen rubble and setting up a triage. They worked through the night and into the early morning. They continued to sift through piles of debris for several days after. If it were not for the brave efforts of the servicemembers like Steve Sterling. perhaps other lives would have been lost. Today. as we honor those who were lost and injured in the attack. I honor all of the military personnel who responded. I thank them for their selflessness and courage. The explosion caused by the truck bomb was so great. it was heard from more than 20 miles away and left a hole in the ground nearly 35 feet deep. It was discovered later that this bombing had been planned for 3 years. We also learned it was carried out by a militant group that sought solely to target members of our military. This disgusting act was one of the most brazen attacks on American military personnel. Sadly. it was not the last. It is important that we do not forget the victims whose lives were lost as a result because their bravery and service deserves our recognition. That is why I was pleased to support the resolution honoring these gallant men and women. ensuring they are never forgotten. There will never be a way to predict and prevent all such acts of violence. but we can take comfort in knowing that we have the best and most valiant individuals standing on the frontline.
1140103824,"Mr. President. today we are going to finally consider legislation addressing Puerto Ricos economic crisis. For the past year and even longer. Democrats in both Houses of Congress have proposed legislation that would empower Puerto Rico to adjust a significant portion of its debt. Every time we have tried. it has been blocked by the Republicans. As the weeks and months passed without a solution. the situation in Puerto Rico has worsened. and that is an understatement. In the New York Times this morning. the editorial board stressed the importance of congressional action. and I quote what they said: The fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico is also a humanitarian crisis. The Senate now has an opportunityand the obligation to address both. It is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on a bill already approved by the House that would restructure the islands debt and could create the conditions for recovery. If the bill loses. Puerto Rico will default on Friday on a $2 billion debt payment. creditors will keep suing for full repayment and essential services on the island. including health. sanitation. education. electricity. public transportation and public safety. will continue to decline. The economic crisis is a humanitarian disaster. Medical services have diminished. Hospitals are unable to pay their bills. Puerto Ricos largest hospital has closed two of its wings and reduced the number of beds by 25 percent and cut pay for all employees. Electricity at one hospital. the Santa Rosa Hospital. was suspended for lack of payment. Can you imagine one of our hospitals having to close because the electricity bill cant be paid? Puerto Ricos only air ambulance company had to suspend operations. At the pediatric center in Puerto Ricos primary medical center. pharmaceutical providers are only going to supply chemotherapy drugs COD. cash on delivery. How troubling is that? Children are being deprived of cancer treatment medication. The effects of Puerto Ricos debt crisis reach beyond health care. Already. the Puerto Rican government has been forced to close 150 schools. Leaders anticipate closing a total of 500 schools in the next few years. That would be half of all public schools in Puerto Rico. Businesses have shuttered. Labor force participation is substantially below the U.S. average. Puerto Ricans on the island are fleeing to the mainland at an alarming rate. Even as Puerto Rico was drowning in more than $70 billion of debt and forced to take unprecedented austerity measures. Republicans in Congress dithered. They continued to waffle. Finally. this spring congressional Republican leaders agreed to negotiate and address this economic and fiscal emergency. The legislation before us is far from perfect. Oh. is it far from perfect. What they have done to labor. minimum wage. the oversight board. environmentalit is bad stuff. It is far from perfect. I share my colleagues very deep concerns about this compromise legislation. If Republicans were serious about progrowth measures. they should have addressed some of the disparities Puerto Rico faces under Federal programs. They should have worked with us to fix Puerto Ricos unequal treatment under Medicaid and Medicare or extend key refundable tax credits to the islands government. Republicans should have extended overtime rules and the minimum wage. I take issue with the oversight board and their excessive powers and appointment structure. For all the Republican leaders promises about an open amendment process. Democrats have not been allowed to offer amendments to improve the bill. The tree is filled. How many times did we hear the Republican leader come to the floor and say: Oh. it is terrible. REID has filled the tree. Well. I should have waited and taken some lessons from him. We will just add that broken promise to the Republican leaders growing list of not keeping his word. such as the budget. a full workweek. and tax credits that are so vital to renewable energy projects. If Democrats had written this bill. it would be very different from what we are voting on today. But I am going to vote for passage of this bill because we must help Puerto Rico before July 1. Otherwise. we turn that island nationcountry. I should sayall American citizensturn them over to the hedge funds. and they will sue them to death. and that is too bad. We must do something now. As the Democrats stated in a letter that every Member of our caucus sent to Senator MCCONNELL earlier this year. Puerto Rico needs a workable debtrestructuring process. While there are many things we may not like about this legislation. at the end of the day this legislation provides tools that allow Puerto Rico to survive. to hopefully restructure a meaningful portion of its debt. I wish we had something better. Secretary Lew sent a letter to Senator MCCONNELL and to me a few days ago. [Puerto Ricos] only hope for recovery and growth is legislation that authorizes the tools necessary for better fiscal management and a sustainable level of debt. While much work still needs to be done. this legislation meets the Treasurys criteria. and it is a step in the right direction. Not acting today to provide Puerto Rico with debt relief and protection from creditors lawsuits will have dire consequences and worsen the crisis. Puerto Ricos only elected representative in Congress. Resident Commissioner PEDRO PIERLUISI. said it best in a letter he sent to me: PROMESA Which is a word meaning ""promise"" in Spanish. and that is the name of this billis an imperfect but indispensable bill that constitutes the only realistic means to prevent the collapse of Puerto Ricos government. to protect regular citizens. pension plan participants and bondholders. to stem the tide of Puerto Rico families moving to the states. to enable the Puerto Rico government to regain access to the credit markets. and to lay the groundwork for Puerto Ricos economy to grow. The Resident Commissioner is correct. Mr. President. 3.5 million American citizens who call Puerto Rico home need this relief. and they need it now. We should pass this legislation today and give Puerto Rico the relief it so desperately needs. Mr. President. would the Chair announce the business of the day."

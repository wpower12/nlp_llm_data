1140000441,Mr. Speaker. I thank Chairman NEUGEBAUER for yielding and for all his efforts on this. I also appreciate the fact that he said my efforts were tireless. Chairman HENSARLING. at times. thought they were tiresome. I want to thank the chairman for putting a good spin on it. but very seriously. I want to thank him for his efforts. This is a bill where a number of us started off from different positions. from different perspectives. In true legislative form. we came together. This bill that we passed in December was a solid bill. Unfortunately. it was not taken up by the Senate. but it is essential that we pass it today because. as my good friend Mrs. MALONEY said. this could have a devastating effect on the construction industry and on the American economy if it is not renewed as quickly as possible. This has to be reauthorized. It is absolutely essential. I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING again for his efforts throughout this. Again. it has been a long process. but we stayed at it. and I thank him for that. Obviously. I thank Mrs. MALONEY and the ranking member. Ms. WATERS. Also. Mr. CAPUANO has been a fighter on this from the start. Again. we came together. This is a bill that. as I have said a number of times. was absolutely essential after September 11. when terrorism risk insurance could not be obtained. It even became more obvious as time went on how essential it was. how we desperately need it. and we have to preserve it. Also. not one Federal dollar has been expended on it. yet billions of dollars in revenue. construction projects. jobs. and expansion of the economy has resulted because of it. We are voting today. in a way. on a bill which. as Mrs. MALONEY said. is going to go on for another 6 years. That gives it permanence and stability. It gives the construction industry. the real estate industry. and the people on the ground who want those construction jobs the ability to go forward. It lets municipalities know there is going to be construction going ahead in their jurisdictions. It is a plusplus all the way. The changes that were made. the reforms that were made. I didnt believe they had to be done. but the fact is they are done. and they are not going to change the overall impact. They are not going to have any meaningful determinative effect whatsoever. Again. I am proud to support this bill in all its aspects. Mr. SCOTT from Georgia had a great concern about the insurers. I share that also. I think it is important that be in this bill. I know that was a bit of an obstacle in the Senate. but it shouldnt be. It had overwhelming support in the House. I know the great majority of the Members in the Senate support it. Now. we pass this on suspension today. sending a strong signal how we support this bill in its entirety. From my conversationsand I think Mrs. MALONEY has had the same conversationswe feel confident that the Senate is going to pass it. When they do. it will be a victory for the American people. a victory for American business. a victory for American labor. and a victory for the American people to show that we have fought all the way back from the horrors of 9111. and we are going to make sure that never again are we put in that position as far as the damage it can have on our economy. I would end this by saying that when we saw the attack in Paris today. we realized what can happen with a terrorist attack. how it can happen at any moment. and why it is essential this be reauthorized. Again. I thank the chairman for his efforts and patience over the last several years.
1140020090,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the rule and also of the underlying bills. H.R. 1731 and H.R. 1560. As was pointed out. I am the only Member of Congress who is on the Homeland Security Committee and the Intelligence Committee. and I was able to both take part and also to observe closely the extent to which the gentleman from Texas. Chairman MCCAUL. and the gentleman from California. Chairman NUNES. worked with Members on both sides of the aisle. worked with privacy groups. worked with Federal officials. government officials. and administration officials to try to make this as bipartisan a bill as possible. to ensure that privacy would be protected. but also to ensure that everything possible can be done to protect our Nation against cyber intrusions. Now. every day there are attacks upon our infrastructure. The critical infrastructuremostly in private handsis being targeted. and Federal networks. databases that are vital to our national security. are under assault every second of every day. Cyberterrorism. whether it is carried out by a nationstate. such as Iran or Russia or China. or carried out by terrorist organizations. such as ISIS or al Qaeda. is extremely damaging and threatening to our national security. and it is essential that we. especially since so much of our critical infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. allow for sharing. that we allow companies to share information with the government. that there is mutual sharing with the government. with the private sector. so that these companies can do it without fear of being sued. without fear of liabilitythey act in good faith. they do what has to be done. Every measure that was put in thereI know the gentleman from Colorado disagrees. but every measure is in there to ensure that individual rights will not be violated. that privacy will not be violated. And again. we have to look at. for instance. if the gentleman from Colorado is wrong. what this could mean to our country. how this could devastatedevastateour infrastructure. devastate our national security. devastate our financial system. So again. this was not something that was rushed into. And when you have both bills passing out of committee with. as far as I recall. not one dissenting votenot that everyone was in full agreement with the bills. But the fact is this is probably as close to a consensus as you can come in the Halls of Congress on such a critical and. in some ways. such a controversial issue. to find that type of unanimity on the two committees that deal with this most significantly. H.R. 1731 is the Homeland Security Committee bill that allows this information to be shared. The port will be the Department of Homeland Security. and that was done. again. working with privacy groups and working with those who are concerned with civil liberties. at the same time working with those who realize how absolutely essential to our security passage of this legislation is and how we have to have this type of cooperation. this type of sharing. this information sharing. and being done with the government and with the private sector working together to combat these enemies which can come at us from all directions. Again. every second of every day these attacks are being attempted and carried out. That is the crisis that faces us as a nation. It is not as obvious as a bomb going off in Times Square. and it is not as obvious as a bomb going off at the Boston Marathon. but it is just as critical.
1140024709,I thank the gentleman for yielding. and I thank him for his years of service in law enforcement and for his dedication here in the United States Congress. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of this legislation. I think it is particularly appropriate that this bill will be passed during National Police Week at a time when we honor those who put their lives on the line every day. This isnt just an abstraction. This is really very real. as we saw tonight with the delegation from Mississippi acknowledging their two police officers who were murdered on Saturday night. And just last week in New York a neighbor and constituent of mine. Brian Moore. a member of the NYPD. was shot down. He was murdered in Queens Village in Queens. New York. a young man. 25 years old. He already had 150 arrests. He was a member of an elite anticrime unit. He was shot down in the prime of life. His father was a retired police sergeant. His cousins were on the NYPD and also the Nassau County Police Department. So these are real. Mr. Speaker. These are real lives. These are real lives that are lost. These are real people putting their lives on the line. and there are real families who suffer when they are left behind. That is why it is so important. I think. that we in Congress acknowledge that. One way to do that is by being able to present a flag signed by the Speaker and by the Member of Congress who represents the person who was killed in the line of duty. Tonight we had a new Member of Congress sworn in. DAN DONOVAN from Staten Island. DAN was with me on Friday at the funeral of Brian Moore. Also. we had two tragic deaths in December. Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. two NYPD officers who were murdered in Brooklyn. DAN and I were at that funeral along with thousands and thousands. in fact. tens of thousands of officers from all over the country. So it is important that we stand in solidarity with the men and women of blue. They come under terrible onslaughts and attacks. So much of it is untrue. so much of it is slanderous. and so much of it is carried on by the media. But. Mr. Speaker. the fact is these men and women are out there every day. They are out there doing their job. and it is really important that we stand with them. The very least we can do is stand here in Congress and support them and also then pay them the tribute of standing with their family with the flag when that terrible moment comes that they lose their lives in the line of duty. So with that. Mr. Speaker. I again thank the gentleman for his leadership. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his bipartisan spirit. and I strongly urge support of this legislation.
1140045561,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1300. the First Responder Anthrax Preparedness Act. which I introduced along with my good friend and colleague from New Jersey. BILL PASCRELL. This important. bipartisan legislation will ensure that emergency response providers have access to preevent anthrax vaccines. An anthrax attack is a serious mass casualty threat. Our national response capability to a widearea anthrax attack would be greatly enhanced by having prevaccinated responders able to deploy immediately and confidently. knowing that they have been afforded as much protection as possible. To achieve that goal. this legislation establishes a preevent anthrax vaccination program to provide surplus anthrax vaccines from the Strategic National Stockpile to emergency response providers on a voluntary basis. In advance of the full vaccination program. the bill directs the Secretary of DHS to carry out a pilot program. Both the preevent vaccination program and the pilot program are required to have robust communication. education. and training for program participants. The bill requires a report on the progress of the pilot and directs the Department of Homeland Security to conduct risk assessments regarding anthrax terror attacks and to share threat information with State and local law enforcement. The Department has been working for over 3 years on establishing a preevent vaccination effort for first responders. but the project has been continually stalled. I am encouraged that DHS has hired a vaccination expert from the Department of Defense to take over the effort. and I believe that the mandates in this legislation will ensure that the pilot program moves forward. I would like to thank Committee on Homeland Security Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member THOMPSON. along with Chairman MCSALLY and Ranking Member DON PAYNE of the committees Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications for their leadership on this issue and their work to advance this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Homeland Security Committee staff Kerry Kinirons. Kate Nichols. and Rosanna Muno. And this is significant. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Chairman UPTON and his staff at Energy and Commerce. Carly McWilliams and Karen Christian. for working with us on this bill. This bill is a great example of how committees can and should work together to advance commonsense legislation and not get involved in turf battles. I will include the letters exchanged by Chairman MCCAUL and Chairman UPTON on H.R. 1300 in the RECORD. H.R. 1300 has 50 bipartisan cosponsors and is supported by the International Association of Fire Chiefs. the International Association of EMS Chiefs. and the Alliance for Biosecurity. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. which will help to ""protect our protectors."" and I reserve the balance of my time."
1140059802,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this legislation. The bill under consideration ensures that the Department of Homeland Security has the authority and congressional mandate to create a robust Insider Threat Program. In the Manning and Snowden espionage scandals. two trusted insiders abused their access to classified information. When Aaron Alexis attacked the Washington Navy Yard. 12 Americans lost their lives. In the face of these insider threat scenarios. it is vital that government agencies have the tools to detect and disrupt future insider threat situations before damage is done. Unfortunately. all three were able to conduct their traitorous work undetected because the government had at one time vetted and granted them access to secure facilities and information systems. H.R. 3361 reinforces the message that a security clearance is a privilege granted to individuals who have pledged to protect the American people from threats domestically and abroad. Had investigators more thoroughly scrutinized Edward Snowdens background. they might have identified disturbing trends that made him unfit to hold a clearance of any kind and a potential insider threat to U.S. national security. Had Federal adjudicators had access to criminal history records from the Seattle Police Department. they would have been aware of Aaron Alexis arrest in 2004 on firearms charges and potentially conducted a more rigorous screening of his background prior to authorizing him access to the Washington Navy Yard. Trusted insiders. going back to Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen. not only severely damaged national security. their traitorous actions led to the loss of life. In each case. the postbreach review highlighted that the previously trusted individual exhibited suspicious behavior. but it was not reported due to a lack of understanding by colleagues or failures in the reinvestigation process. In describing the new type of insider threat represented by Snowden and WikiLeaks. Michael Hayden correctly concluded that. ""in this new. modern. connected era. the trusted insider who betrays us is far more empowered to do damage far greater than these kinds of people were able to do in the past. And therefore we have to be even more vigilant."" The Department of Homeland Security has over 280.000 employees. including tens of thousands with access to classified or sensitive information. The Department has an existing Insider Threat Program and is moving forward to increase security controls on internal systems. but much more remains to be done. The bill directs DHS to develop a strategy for the Department to identify. prevent. mitigate. and respond to insider threats. and requires DHS to ensure that personnel understand what workplace behavior may be indicative of a potential insider threat and how their activity on DHS networks will be monitored. The bill codifies a comprehensive Insider Threat Program at DHS that can be implemented throughout the Department and its component agencies and. most importantly. reinforces the importance of preventing future insider attacks. I want to thank Homeland Security Chairman MCCAUL. Ranking Member THOMPSON. Ranking Member HIGGINS. and Congressmen KATKO. DONOVAN. and BARLETTA for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. The bill went through regular order and received bipartisan support during subcommittee and full committee consideration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can establish a comprehensive. transparent DHSwide Insider Threat Program that is a model for the public and private sectors. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140077979,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I especially thank her for arranging this Special Order tonight in memory of Justice Scalia. who was truly a legal giant. He was a man who surpassed all of the intellects that I have been aware of in my lifetime. Certainly no one in the legal profession has demonstrated more of a love for the law. more respect for the law. and more respect for the original intent of the Constitution. Now. I have nowhere near the personal contact with Justice Scalia that the gentlewoman from Virginia did or the gentleman from Nebraska . I did meet him on a number of occasions. I had the opportunity to speak with him. Usually our conversations consisted of talking about the fact that we lived in working class neighborhoods in Queens. We grew up about a mile apart from each other. We both attended Jesuit high schools. That is about where the comparison ended as far as the Jesuit high schools. because he was valedictorian and I was far from it. He was a person who had the strength of somebody from the neighborhood. but he had the scholars intellect. He had an intellect that went beyond tremendous intelligence. It was an intellect that was shaped and framed by his deep religious faith and a belief in undiminished. lasting. and immutable principles. That is what reflected throughout his opinions. Yet he never let his own feelings or prejudices influence his thinking. That was certainly proven in the flag burning case. If there is anyone who loved his country and would oppose the concept of the act of flag burning. it was Justice Scalia. Yet he upheld the act as an expression of free speech. as much as it pained him. Something that many of us in politics and government have a hard time doing is following the letter of the law. following the intent of the law. and following the meaning of the law. Somehow. we like to put in our own feelings and beliefs. The fact is Justice Scalia told us that there is a higher principle than that. Also he had such a respect for language. There were no easy words thrown about. There were no escape clauses or phrases. There was an intent and purpose and meaning to everything that he did. To read his opinions. whether in the majorityand knowing that he was in the majority made us feel much betteror in his dissents. you realized. again. how determined he was. how forceful he was. and how committed he was to arriving at the correct decisionone which. again. followed the original intent of the Constitution. There were several references by BARBARA COMSTOCK to his funeral service on Saturday. Again. it was an expression by so many people of their love and respect for such an outstanding human being. a person whom I doubt we will ever see the likes of againcertainly. in our lifetimes. He was a giant of the law. He was a giant of his faith. He was a giant of his country. I am proud to join with all of my colleagues tonightespecially BARBARA COMSTOCK. who arranged this Special Orderin honoring the memory of Justice Scalia and hoping that that memory lives forward to carry out his unmatched love for the law. love for his country. and love for his family and his religion.

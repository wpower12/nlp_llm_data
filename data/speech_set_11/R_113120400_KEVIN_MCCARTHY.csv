1130061595,I thank the chairman for his work in keeping his pledge of bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 3350. the Keep Your Health Plan Act. From the start. ObamaCare has been a disaster. First. the individual mandate was a bad idea before and is even more dangerous now because it is forcing people to choose health care they do not want. cannot afford. and isnt right for themselves and their families. Second. the Presidents credibility continues to crumble as independent news sources have confirmed that he intentionally broke his promise to every American about whether they can keep his insurance under this law. We will continue to see the shock waves of ObamaCare. Today. it is the fact that Americans cannot keep their coverage. Tomorrow. it will be the staggering and unexpected cost. Next month. it will be about losing access to their doctors. and the list continues. No administrative fix will undo the harm this law has caused. Republicans believe that we must try and help Americans who have been harmed by ObamaCare. That is why. today. we will pass a bill to allow Americans to continue to enroll in plans currently offered without facing the individual mandate penalty. What the American people and our constituents need is certainty. The only approach that begins to provide them certainty is the bill before us today. Our bill allows Americans a choice. It lets individuals keep their health care plans while giving others who currently are uninsured an escape hatch from ObamaCare. Our bill will allow individuals. whether one is a mother of a sick child. a small business owner. or a young. invincible adult. to keep their current plans. The National Federation of Independent Business and senior groups. such as 60 Plus. are urging Congress to fulfill its duty and pass this bill. I urge my Democratic friends to join with us. Many of them voted for this bill. They stated they had an intent that Americans could keep their plans. Today is their opportunity to keep that pledge.
1130063497,I thank my colleague for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 1900 and in support of the work this Chamber has accomplished this week. This was an important week in the House. We will have passed three bills that further the energy revolution that has propelled the U.S. to the forefront of the worlds energy producers. So to hear a few of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle disparage this work. even so much as refer to it as egregious. is disappointing. First. we passed legislation that reduced bureaucratic delays on energy products on Federal lands that are providing resources to power our economy. As America. we will soon become the largest energy producer in the world. It is astonishing that this occurred while energy production on Federal lands has actually decreased. We guaranteed that energy production from hydraulic fracturing on Federal lands is overseen by the regulator with the best track record. the States. And today we are ensuring that. once harnessed. the energy resources will reach endusers in the safest. most efficient and reliable manner. In its lifecycle. the quality of all Americans improves. and there is no better example than. at the start of this month. November 1. the first pipeline to enter New York City in 40 years opened. That was 40 years that it took. What happened once it entered New York City? The price dropped. The price fell by 17 percent. Do you realize if you buy gas in New York City. it is cheaper than in Louisiana? But 40 years that it took. To me. that was egregious. The savings extend far beyond New York City. In 2012. affordable energy added $1.200 of disposal income to the average U.S. household. That will go to $2.700 by 2020 and $3.500 by 2025. That is real savings. Today we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to streamline. to protect. and to lower the costs for all Americans. to actually be able to produce and create more jobs in America. That is why you see a very diverse group of support for this legislation. from unions. to associations. to Americans that want to keep more of what they earn. create more American jobs. and then. again. stop any egregious falsity that it takes 40 years to build a pipeline.
1130073833,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Congressman VALADAO. Congressman NUNES. and all of the delegation for their work when it comes to water. The news from California is not bright. The current news: our drought is the worst in a century. Governor Brown has declared a state of emergency because of the drought. Our water storage is at near empty. Farmland is going fallow. Drinking water is threatened. The State actually says in its latest report that 17 communities can go dry in 4 months. In the absence of God our options are limited to ease this pain. It didnt have to be this way. But why are we here today and why are we debating this bill? Well. without action farms are going to go fallow. So what does that mean for the rest of the Nation? A lot of people dont look at what happens throughout California and the Central Valley. Most of the produce is produced there for the Nation and the world. If you just look at a few: 94 percent of all tomatoes. 93 percent of all broccoli. 89 percent of all carrots. 78 percent of all lettuce. So that means prices will go up. It also means you are going to buy that produce somewhere else. You are going to buy it overseas: maybe China. maybe Mexico. What about the food safety? More importantly. what about those jobs? What about those workers? Just a few short years ago. unemployment in some of these cities were 40 percent. It is already more than 10. The worst part of all this is it didnt have to be this way. We could plan for it. I have heard colleagues talk about this. Mr. Chairman. that back in 1994 we actually had a bipartisan agreement: the BayDelta Accord. It was more than just Republicans and Democrats agreeing. It was environmentalists. farmers. water users. Everybody came to an agreement. But that bond was broken. The reason we debate this is water is so precious. Most of the snowpack comes from the north and travels down to the south. We have a State water project thatwhich is a little ironicGovernor Brown. when his father was Governor built more than 50 years ago. There have always been allocations to send it down south. This year they made history. In the history of the water project. the allocation is zerozero. When you are growing up you study history. There are always those Aesops Fables. Do you remember Aesop? He was that slave in ancient Greece that would tell these tales to teach about a moral lesson. One of those fables talked about the ant and the grasshopper. where the ant during summertime. because he knew winter would come. would go out and work hard and store food for the winter. Not the grasshopper. He would be idle out there in the summer enjoying life. and hopefully nothing bad ever happened. Well. over the years. government regulation has made it harder. Government regulation has changed the BayDelta Accord. It is safe to say. environmentalists have sued. Environmentalists have decided that fish are more important than those who are unemployed. that maybe they come before the individual. What does that mean? Since 2007. the State Water Project has lost 2.6 million acre feet because of these policies. Now. what does that mean. 2.6 million acre feet? That means that is enough for the annual water needs of every resident in Los Angeles. New York. and Chicago combined. Where did that water go? Out to the ocean. Why would we send it out to the ocean when we could store it for the drought that we knew would happen? There is nothing that illustrates this broken system more than just 3 years ago. You have all seen those photos that people have shown down here on TV of California when it had a snowpack and California today when it is all dry. Just 3 years ago. do you know what that snowpack was? More than 170 percent. Boy. that would be a good year to be an ant. that would be a good year to send it down. that would be a good year to store for today so those communities would not go dry or that land would not go fallow. That wasnt the case. Do you know what the allocation was when we had 170 percent of snowpack? Eighty percent. Do you know what is unjust in all of this? This year when we get zero percent. or when we got 80 percent of allocation. the bill was always the same: you paid 100 percent. regardless of what allocation you got. What about property rights? What about responsibility? What about a broken system? So what does this bill actually do? Well. first and foremost. it puts families before fish. It goes back to an agreement that everybody agreed upon. and it moves us in a place where we can prepare. Standing defenselessly in the face of future droughts is not a noble gesture. It is actually insanity. Today. this House will act again. because we would not be in the dryer place that we are today had the Senate taken up the bill we acted on in the last Congress. Why? Because this House believes and understood and learned the lessons of the fables beforethat we prepare. But the Senate. in the grasshopper style. stood idly by. Our SenatorsCalifornia is pretty powerful in the Senate. Mr. Chairman. I will say California has two Senators that are chairs of committees. There was an opportunity to act. What is unique in this form of government and what we have. the greatest in the world. we have two Houses. It doesnt mean both Houses have to agree at the very beginning. It does mean that you take action and show where you stand. just like the House did 2 years ago. The Senate took no stance. so how do we know where they stand? Well. we will act again. The Senate needs to act. show us where they stand. go to conference. and stand up for the families of California. This has gone on too long. We do not have to be in the situation we stand in today. There are families that did not have to be unemployed had we acted in the Senate. based upon what we did. There are communities that would not have had to go dry had we acted before. So enough of rhetoric. enough of the fights. the time is now. As the Sun sets today. a bill will be out of this House. but still nothing is even introduced in the Senate. Mr. Chairman. I implore. dont make California hurt anymore.
1130077599,"Mr. Chairman. in 2008 in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle. President Obama warned us that under his policies for energy. ""electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket."" Now it appears with high electricity costs. that this is a promise that the President chose to keep. Today. millions of Americans are suffering from one of the coldest winters in recent memory. and in some cases. the most expensive. In New York. some homes are seeing their heating bills double. but it doesnt have to be this way. The U.S. is currently enjoying a revolution in energy production. the energy that heats our homes and keeps us warm during the cold winter nights. Americans across the country should be celebrating this breakthrough. In an economy where the Nations income today is lower than in the year 2000. abundant energy should provide a sense of relief to strained budgets. but because of this administrations policies. Americans are simply left out in the cold with their energy bills. First. the Democrats tried capandtrade. but that failed in a Democratled Congress. Now this administration has proposed arguably the most expensive regulation ever by the EPA. one that would render the construction of any future coal power plant impossible through the mandating of technology that isnt readily attainable. Today. coal accounts for 37 percent of total U.S. electricity production. The EPAs regulation will cost approximately $1.200 per household per year in lost income. That is $100 more a month. Most importantly. this regulation will cause the greatest amount of harm. lost jobs. diminished incomes. and higher electricity bills in areas where incomes are modest. as are the lifestyles of those who live there. It isnt the rich on Fifth Avenue or in Beverly Hills who will be impacted. it is the American working class. Communities like Indianas Second District. home to our good friend. Congresswoman JACKIE WALORSKI. or Ohios Fourth District. home to our friend JIM JORDAN. or the First District. home to Chairman RYAN. or even Wisconsins Second or Iowas First District. both represented by my colleagues on the other side. All will be unnecessarily hurt by this regulation. For all the talk from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about fairness. this regulation is profoundly unfair. The Electricity Security and Affordability Act sponsored by my friend. ED WHITFIELD. rejects the administrations back door attacks on Americas energy bills. This legislation restores opportunity and fairness by ensuring more American paychecks do not unnecessarily go to expanding electricity and heating costs. Mr. Chairman. at a time when energy production is booming. the cost per family should be dropping. not rising. I suppose the President actually held true to another promise: he has promised an alltheabove energy policy. I had hoped that meant increasing energy production from all sources. not increasing prices on all consumers. I urge my colleagues to reject the Presidents plan for higher energy costs and support this legislation."
1130086076,Mr. Chair. I rise today in support of the Path to Prosperity budget. Every day. millions of Americans are competing in a race with an economy that asks us to accept a new normal. an anemic growth. an Obama economy. I was recently in a high school speaking of the challenge that America had. and a student asked me a question about it. I asked him did he play a sport. He happened to be on the swim team. I said: Let me give you an analogy of America competing worldwide by a swim meet. Picture America in a swim competition with every other country. Many times at the early years. after the 1980s. we would jump into the pool and we would swim and we would win. We would hang those championship banners out. In this new Obama economy. things changed. a stimulus spending. Well. that meant we had to add a weight belt. about 20 pounds. Then the tax increases came. We had to add more weight. An onslaught of regulation. pretty soon you are up to 100 pounds. You know what? We jump in that pool and we dont always win. And nobody says take the weight belt off. They just say you just dont swim like you used to. Think about it. Since the recession. parttime employment has increased at the expense of fulltime. Over 90 million Americans are out of the workforce all together. 46 million live in poverty. You know. the CBO. Congressional Budget Office. now says the new natural rate for unemployment is 6 percent. That means 11 million Americans not working is somehow natural in America. That is what a weight belt will do for you. It will drown you. Today is different. Today we are going to unshackle. We are going to take that weight belt off. We have a budget that creates a Tax Code that is simpler and fairer. one that lets you keep more money in your pocket and lets you invest differently. one that balances and takes away that debt of the weight belt. one that unshackles the energymore jobs. cheaper fuel. more manufacturing jobs to be able to grow. We strengthen Medicare and Medicaid. So we take care of the current and the future. We plan to swim for years and compete for years in the future. I tell you. today. there are two different directions: you can stay with this anemic growth or you can jump into a pool with a future brighter than we have seen before and one that we know that will hang a new banner of championship. that America will rise once again with the prosperity of a balanced budget. one that will take us into a future of strength.

Members are advised that the House may also consider an extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. I thank the gentleman.
1130114977,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise today against an unlawful expansion of Federal power. The EPAs attempt at an unprecedented power grab will ultimately saddle hardworking Americans. small businesses. and farmers with new. onerous regulatory burdens. Under this proposed new rule. the EPA will be able to claim jurisdiction over almost all bodies of water in the U.S. So. along with the bays and rivers. EPAs hand will extend over streams. ponds. ditches. and even storm water runoff. Beyond sounding ridiculous. this rule will impact farmers. energy producers. and any private citizens that use their land for economic or recreational purposes. It is harmful and unnecessary. I live in the West. The West is burdened right now with the drought. Some of that drought is based upon excess regulations that choose fish over people. and that water will run out to the ocean because of a regulation and a lawsuit. I have seen where regulatory effects and burdens have gone before. I have a town in my community called Taft. It is a hardworking town like many of you have. The EPA has been a part of it before. It is a town that could be anywhere in America. Taft had a waterway. the EPA said. called Sandy Creek. The only challenge. though. in Sandy Creek is it was a dry ditch. It had been dry for 30 years. So when they came to me and they wanted to be able to move forward. they found that the Federal Government was trying to impose a permitting regulation of excess regulation on this private land. I had to personally call them. and they said: No. you cannot do it because of the creek. I had to drive an individual all the way out to the dry dirt and sit them in the dry creekbed until finally they said ""yes."" Under the new bill. Sandy Creek will not be dry anymore because that burdensome regulation can possibly be back on them. It could be redesignated. and we will not be able to grow again. Mr. Chairman. we are struggling with job creation in America. We are struggling with small businesses trying to make ends meet. Milk prices are at an alltime high. Why would we burden America with more regulation? Why would we not unshackle what holds us back and let us be able to grow and let people keep their private land and protect our water. but do it in a sense that has common sense?"
1130115997,I thank the gentleman for working together on this. The one thing we know. this is a threat. and this House will act as one as Americans. and I look forward to continuing to work on it.

1130124291,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for his service to this House and this country. You will be greatly missed. Mr. Speaker. I also want to thank those who have worked so diligently on this bill. like Congressman DAVID VALADAO. He understands the need. And we are not here today because we havent thought that we might have this problem. I have stood in this well before with Congressman DEVIN NUNES. looking ahead. trying to be prepared so we can have water throughout California. looking prepared that government. creating a drought when we still have rain and snowpack. Do you realize 4 years ago we had 170 percent of snowpack. but only 80 percent of the water was allocated to come down through the valley? The valley not just feeds California. not just feeds the Nation. but feeds the world. When the valley does not get water. the price of food goes up to all. But you know what is even more important? Those that go out of work. I have watched many elected officials come to this well and talk about unemployment. They say unemployment is below 6 percent. Let me tell you what unemployment is throughout the valley today. There are some cities that have more than 30 percent unemployment. The number one factorwater. So what does the world look like today even though not just this Congress but the Congress before it moved legislation to deal with this issue. We are now at a 1.200year drought. That is much longer than the entire life of this Nation. So if we are at this time. why do we bring this bill before us? I think we should have honesty in this bill. This is not the bill I would write. This is not the bill I would bring forward. This is a bipartisan bill where people on both sides of the aisle sat down. We said we need a temporary bill that lives within these means. So do we change endangered species? No. we do not. What does this bill do? It says. in the rainy season when the flood waters are high. can we not move water down through the valley. That is what this bill does. It also has a safeguard that. if the fish are harmed. to stop. Does this bill go on forever? No. It goes the length of September or to the length of what the Governor has declared within the drought. Now. I know government cannot make it rain. but government can stop the government policies that pick fish over people. Government can prepare ahead of time that. if we are going to have a rainy season coming. we allow the water to have the best use of where it goes. that it protects the fish while at the time allocates water to the valley so everyone wins in the process. That is why it was bipartisan. That is why we sat together. That is why it is temporary. That is why this bill is brought before us today. I would like to thank everybody on both sides of the aisle that worked for it. But what is unfortunate. some people will say things it is not. The most important thing we should do in this House is make sure fairness is provided. I think the greatest fairness that should be provided is being prepared for when water comes. But what is even more important is looking at the faces of the 30 percent unemployed. looking at the faces throughout that valley and saying it does not have to be that way. Government can make a difference if both sides would work together as we did to craft this bill.

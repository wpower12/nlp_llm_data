1140012087,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank my good friend for yielding. I want to thank my colleagues. PAYNE and KELLY. for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. You are our message team. You are the people who let all of the world. all of America know what the CBC is dealing with on a daily basis. and I thank you for your work. Last week. Loretta Lynchs nomination to serve as the next U.S. Attorney General was finally passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote of 128. I use the word ""finally"" because there has been a significant delay with her confirmation. Why her confirmation has taken so long confounds me. I mean. what exactly is the Senate majority waiting for? What is the delay? The fact that it took over 100 days to just get her to a committee vote is particularly troubling when one considers how long it took to actually confirm former Attorneys General: Janet Reno. 29 days. John Ashcroft. 42 days. Michael Mukasey. 53 days. and Alberto Gonzales. who had to resign as Attorney General. 86 days. Clearly. Attorney Lynchs confirmation has been singled out for delay. Ash Carters confirmation moved expeditiously. and he is now the Secretary of Defense. His hearing took place on February 4. He was voted out of committee on February 11. and ultimately confirmed on the Senate floor on February When testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Attorney Lynch showed grace under pressure while enduring long hours of vigorous questioning. Later. she provided answers to hundreds of questions. all on the record. resulting in more than 200 pages of testimony. Her professionalism and responsiveness are well documented. Further. Senators in both parties have lauded Attorney Lynchs qualifications. Her record speaks for itself. Senator HATCH. one of the three Republicansshamefully. three Republicanswho recently voted in favor of Attorney Lynchs nomination in committee. stated: I have concluded that Ms. Lynchs full record. including but hardly limited to her hearing testimony. shows that she is qualified to serve as Attorney General. That is all that they are trying to show to the American public. All they need to say is that she is qualified. If they had the President and the White House. they would pick who they want. But they dont have the President and the White House. so they have to deal with who he picks. And she is qualified. Further. Senators in both parties understand how important it is to fill the position of Attorney General. Yet she continues to be penalized by many members of the majority party for President Obamas immigration policies and a general disdain for Attorney General Holder. Here we are stopping the Attorney General nomination because of immigration. we wont fund the Department of Homeland Security because of immigrationthere is a problem in the Congress of the United States. In fact. she is being judged for the actions of others. and we know that. This is nothing more than political gamesmanship. I call on my colleagues in the other Chamber to stop the charade and get on with the confirmation. I urge the Senate to put Attorney Lynchs nomination on the floor immediately. Judge Attorney Lynch on her record and her merit. and do it now."
1140039945,Mr. Speaker. today we find ourselves on the House floor yet again debating H.R. 5. After several months of delay. the majority party has yet to realize that this bill is not in the best interest of Americas children. We all agree that Congress must reauthorize a strong Elementary and Secondary Education Act. H.R. 5 does not meet the test. Any reauthorization must ensure that education is properly funded at the State and Federal level for all of Americas children. that all students have access to a wellrounded education. which includes subjects like physical education. music. and the arts. and that students are annually assessed. which allows for parents and teachers to measure students progress. H.R. 5 does none of these things. Instead. it fails our students. our teachers. and our families. The bill drastically reduces education funding. eliminates and weakens protections for disabled students. fails to provide a wellrounded education for all students. and generally makes it more difficult to educate those for whom the act was designed to protect. The bill turns title I funding into a block grant. The program would disproportionately harm disadvantaged and lowincome students. Schools across the country. including some in my own congressional district. rely on these funds to help ensure children are given a fair chance to meet State academic standards. H.R. 5 also allows title I dollars to become portable. which would divert muchneeded funds from the highest need poverty schools and districts. H.R. 5 removes requirements that States ensure students graduate from high school college and career ready. The bill focuses primarily on math and reading assessments. without providing any programmatic support for literacy. for STEM. and for other subjects that provide a wellrounded curriculum. It eliminates wraparound support services. which are very important to needy students. It eliminates afterschool. family engagement. physical. dental. and mental health programs. This year. we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The bill. essentially a civil rights law. reaffirmed that every child has the right to an equal opportunity for a quality education. However. H.R. 5 undermines the laws original intent. turning back the clock on equity and accountability in American public education and ignores the needs of Americas most vulnerable students. H.R. 5 is a step backward in our countrys education system. This legislation fails our students and their families. America deserves better.
1140041680,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank my colleagues. Congressman PAYNE and Congresswoman KELLY. for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour tonight. Mr. Speaker. if you have not noticed. the people of this country are fed up. Quite frankly. so am I. We are at a point in our Nations history when we can no longer give lip service to equality and opportunities to succeed. We must take action to show we mean what we say. otherwise. it is nothing more than empty rhetoric. Mr. Speaker. the Confederate flag is more than just a piece of fabric. It is more than just a visual representation of the Confederacy or part of the storied history of the South. If that were true. we would not be having this conversation today. We would not have buried nine Americans murdered because of the color of their skin. and the Confederate battle flag would still be flying in the State of South Carolina. Lets be honest about the history of the Confederate battle flag. While the majority of this House may want to ignore the facts and rewrite history. we will not be ignored. The Confederate battle flag and any adaptation of it is a painful reminder of intimidation. torture. and murder for all of us in the Black community. It is a flying symbol of hatred and injustice that tells Black and Brown people in this country: Your lives have no value. and you dont matter. It is an embarrassment to all Americans that the majority of this House introduced a spending amendment which included language allowing the battle flag on Federal properties. It is just plain shameful that they would go even further and use procedure to stifle a motion to openly discuss a ban of the Confederate battle flag imagery from the Capitol Grounds. How can the Members of the majority of this House continue to say that they represent all Americans when they refuse to have a real discussion about what is really happening in our country? Have we learned nothing from what has happened in the past few weeks? In a June Gallup poll. African Americans ranked race relations as the most important issue facing the United States. Will taking down the Confederate battle flag immediately change this perspective? Absolutely notbut it will certainly do more than letting it continue to fly. Mr. Speaker. it is time we do away with lip service. It is time we listen to our constituents and take real action toward healing the racial wounds of this country. It is time we move forward. The flag must come down.
1140054894,Mr. Speaker. today I rise in strong opposition to the establishment of the panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. The panels clear partisan aim is to take down Planned Parenthood. an organization providing quality. affordable health care to millions of Americans. Every person has the right to make informed. independent decisions about their health. sexual activity and family planning. Yet. womens reproductive rights continue to come under constant attack at both the state and local levels For all the rhetoric we have heard about how the government should not be in the business of providing health care. the Majority is all too eager to step in and regulate womens access to health services. It is unconscionable that the Majority continues funneling taxpayer dollars to support purely political agendas. Millions were spent defending DOMA after the Justice Department decided it was no longer prudent policy. Even more money is being spent suing President Obama over the Affordable Care Act. even after the Supreme Court upheld the ACAs constitutionality not once. but twice. Most recently. more than $4 million has been spent politicizing the terrorist attack in Benghazi. The Majority now demands we use even more tax payer dollars to attack an organization providing health care to those who need it most. ignoring Congressional committees that found no wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood. Womens access to health care is challenged over and over again. despite Americas high maternal death rate. Women in the United States face a one in 1.800 risk of maternal death. the highest risk of any developed country. In 2014. the overall U.S. health care system ranked last among industrialized nations for the fifth time and is still the most expensive system in the world. The health disparities among our nations racial and ethnic groups are a disgrace. We should focus our attention on these issues. Lets call this exactly what it is. a partisan attack against a single. reputable organization. An attack based on highly edited. unsubstantiated statements and videos. This is a waste of time and taxpayer funded resources. We must get back to doing the peoples work and put a stop to the constant attempts to roll back womens rights. I strongly oppose this Resolution.
1140059948,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today with my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus because last week our nation was reminded. yet again. Black lives have no value. But this time. the reminder was different. It did not come from law enforcement in response to a shooting. traffic stop. or 911 call. Nor did it come from inside a jail cell or a court room. This time. the reminder came from the use of excessive force in a place where most of us would expect it never to happen: our schools. Schools should be safe havens for our nations children. Unfortunately. actions of Spring Valley school resource officer. Ben Fields. caught on video have proven that they are not. Instead of preparing young minds across the country to tackle our nations most complex issues. some of our schools are fostering fear and mistrust. And. this is what my young constituents have told me. On October 16. I held a listening session with more than 400 high school students from Northeast Ohio. I was surprised to hear that nearly all of them felt there was no one they could talk toin their schools or communitiesif they felt unsafe. Today. I am not so shocked. With incidents like the one captured in the Spring Valley video. who could blame them? What messages are acts like these sending our youth? Are they to think this behavior is acceptable and that they matter less. if at all? The over criminalization of AfricanAmerican youth and young adults is already a growing issue in our communities. The number of AfricanAmerican men in jail continues to rise. AfricanAmerican and Latino boys and men tend to receive harsher sentences than their peers of other races. Further. the schooltoprison pipeline is as strong as ever. with our AfricanAmerican students suspended at three times the rate of their White peers. In this case. criminal charges were even filed against the young Spring Valley female student after she was subjected to egregious force by a ""resource officer."" As a nation. we must stop this vicious cycle. It is time to change the narrative and save our communities for generations to come. I call on my colleagues in Congress to work together to pass policies that tell our children their lives have value. We must pass criminal justice reform and support policies that create a safe. nurturing environment in our schools. The future of our communities depends on it."
1140074071,"Mr. Speaker. each February our nation takes time to reflect on the countless contributions African Americans have made to this countrys history. We celebrate innovators like Ohio District 1Is own Langston Hughes. pioneers like astronaut Mae Jamison. as well as political and civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. Black History Month represents inclusion and innovation. It promotes America at its best. For in this month. we appreciate our collective strength and recognize the diversity of each and every patriot. America is a country of immigrants. and our power lies in our differences. To quote Dr. King. ""We may have all come on different ships. but were in the same boat now."" No matter how we arrived. every American should have access to the same opportunity. Every individual should be able to reach his or her own potential and succeed in the home of the free and the land of the brave. Unfortunately. many do not have equitable access to opportunity. This is why the Congressional Black Caucus stands today. Despite the contributions and sacrifice of African Americans. many still suffer from the effects of historic injustice and prejudice. We are almost three times more likely to live in poverty than Whites. and six times more likely to be put in jail. Our unemployment rate is nearly two times the rates of Whites. When we do find work. we make less than our White counterparts. As Black America reflects on its current situation. many tend to ask questions such as. ""What would Dr. King do?"" or ""How would the civil rights leaders of the past address the issues of the present?"" If Dr. King was alive today. I believe he would certainly be proud of who we are. But he would also say that we must commit ourselves to moving forward together as one people and one nation. It is time we ""fix our politics."" Not just in Washington. but everywhere. As President Barack Obama stated recently. ""We are in a time of extraordinary change."" The Members of this House have the opportunity to pass policies that reverse years of bigotry and injustice and level the playing field for all. This Black History Month. I urge my Congressional colleagues to celebrate through legislative action. Develop a new formula to ensure the right to vote for all Americans. Reauthorize the Higher Education Act to help more kids go to college. Combat harsh sentencing through criminal justice reform. These actions wont just honor a race of people. They will further the hope and success of an entire nation."
1140077272,"Mr. Speaker. today I rise to celebrate the 107th anniversary of the NAACP. an organization dedicated to eradicating racism and injustice in the United States. Since its founding in 1909. the NAACP has been a constant voice in the fight for civil rights. But. unlike other organizations. its original battlefield was the courtroom. The founders of the NAACP were smart. They understood that in order to combat ignorance. you must first change the laws that foster it. One of their first actions was to lobby against Jim Crow lynching laws. Though their efforts were unsuccessful. they turned the nations attention to the ongoing mistreatment of Blacks in the 1920s and 30s. In 1954. the NAACP played a pivotal role in the historic landmark case. Brown v. Board of Education. A team of NAACP lawyers joined Thurgood Marshall in a series of legal battles that would lead to segregation in public education being ruled unconstitutional. The organization was then instrumental in the passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts of 1965. Since its inception. the NAACP has been our champion. and its expertise is now needed more than ever. We are at a critical point in our nations history. where strategic. collaborative efforts are best to move our country forward. Like the NAACP. we must be catalysts for change. not the cause of division. The anniversary of the NAACPs founding reminds us what can be done when we work together. We all must play a role in the advancement of our communities. To quote NAACP member Ms. Rosa Parks. ""Racism is still with us. But it is up to us to prepare our children for what they have to meet. and. hopefully. we shall overcome."" As a nation. we must reject discrimination in any form and give all children a chance to succeed in the land of the free and the home of the b rave. To the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. the NAACP. my sincerest gratitude for all you have done to shape American history and ensure all of us have an opportunity to fully participate in the American dream. Thank you for being there in the streets. on college campuses. and at the courthouse. Our communities are indebted to you for the vision in 1909. and the 107 years dedicated to righting the wrongs of our nations past. Thank you for persevering and changing the face of America."
1140088912,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. more than 21 percent of American children live in poverty. More than 15 million children live in foodinsecure households. In fact. households with children are more likely to be food insecure than those without. In my home State of Ohio. 16.9 percent of households experience food insecurity. and Ohios rate is higher than the national average of 14.3. Programs that affect child nutrition. such as the National School Lunch Program. the National School Breakfast Program. and the Summer Food Service Program. are essential tools in the fight to end child hunger. Access to healthy foods during the school day and throughout summer feeding programs is essential to helping children thrive both academically and developmentally. The Improving Child Nutrition and Education Act would increase the burden on schools with new verification requirements and increased community eligibility thresholds. or CEP. I represent one of the Nations most impoverished districts. with nearly 200.000 people living in poverty. Out of 435 districts and the District of Columbia. my district ranks 420th. Only 16 other districts in the United States fare worse than mine. If passed. the changes to CEP alone could result in children across the country losing access to free and reducedprice meals at school. and that is unacceptable. Mr. Speaker. The bill fails to make critical investments in the summer meal program. Meals served through the summer feeding program may be the only ones some children have in a day. If the sponsors of the bill truly wanted to improve child nutrition. they would invest in summer meals to ensure eligible children do not go hungry during the summer months. As we move towards reauthorization. we must strengthen and expand child nutrition programs. Our childrens health and education are not budgetsaving gimmicks. I firmly believe that any attempt to reauthorize child nutrition programs must improve access to healthy foods yearround. This bill does not even come close to meeting the minimum requirement. We must engage in bipartisan conversations about how to best meet the needs of all children. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
1140092032,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. It is a pleasure to watch my fellow Ohioan and friend and the gentleman from New York on this House floor every Monday night bringing the message of the Congressional Black Caucus because indeed they are the people who carry our message to the United States. Mr. Speaker. the schooltoprison pipeline is robbing far too many children of productive futures. Instead of learning in classrooms. a large percentage of our Nations atrisk students sit in jail cells. The numbers dont lie. Black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than White students. More than one in four boys of color with disabilities and nearly one in five girls of color with disabilities receives an outofschool suspension. And studies show that students who are suspended or expelled in school are more likely to end up in prison. Our Nations children deserve better. It is time we prioritize education and not incarceration. Comprehensive criminal justice reform must include policies which dismantle the schooltoprison pipeline. We must reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. a bill that funds delinquency prevention and improvements in State and local juvenile justice programs. supports restorative initiatives. and promotes early intervention. Disrupting the pipeline will provide a pathway for a successful future and lessen the burden on our current judicial system. The number of people incarcerated in America quadrupled between 1980 and 2008. Of the more than 2.3 million Americans incarcerated today. more than 1 million of them are Black. In my home State of Ohio. more than 50.000 people are incarcerated in a system that was designed to only hold 39.000. And on average. States across this Nation spend $30.000 per year to house one inmate. That is at least $19.000 more per year than we spend to educate one child. It is time we get our priorities straight. As ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood. Elementary. and Secondary Education. promoting policies that keep our children in school is one of my top priorities. I ask my colleagues: What are yours?

1130030454,"Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think this is. in many ways. a very sad day for this House. As we know. last week there was an uproar in the country relative to a statement that few women become pregnant from rape. That. of course. is not correct. Theres no science to support that. And of course. this week. we have a bill thats been altered to add a very limited exception for rape and incest that would be available only if the victim has reported the crime to the authorities. And of course. as our last speaker has indicated. this actually makes the situation for the victim of violence. a victim of rape more onerous than for the perpetrators of the violence. something that I think is really quite wrong. The bill attacks the rights of women. guaranteed by our Constitution. to seek a safe. legal procedure when they need it. I have two children. I was thrilled when I became pregnant. Most women are thrilled and look forward to a safe childbirth. But for some. pregnancy can be dangerous. and the restrictions that are imposed in this bill that do not have adequate health exceptions can endanger these women. At the subcommittee. we heard from a witness. a professor at George Washington University. Ms. Christy Zink. about her story. She courageously told her story of seeking abortion care after her muchwanted pregnancy was diagnosed with severe fetal anomalies at the 21st week. in fact. an anomaly that would mean that the muchwanted child would not survive and that. in fact. her health could be compromised had she proceeded. Under this bill. she would not have the opportunity to preserve her own health. She would be required to carry a nonviable fetus to term. and I just think thats wrong. I dont think thats something that the country is asking the Congress to do. The idea that the exception for incest only applies to those under 18 is another mystery. If a girl is molested and raped by her father at age 18. is she less worthy of the protection of her health and the right to get abortion care than her sister at age 17? I think not. It simply makes no sense at all for that provision. Id like to comment also briefly on the repeated discussion of Dr. Kermit Gosnell. He is a monster. Theres no one that I have heard in this Congress or in this country who defends what Dr. Gosnell did. In fact. hes in prison. serving a double life sentence for murder. What he did was illegal. in addition to being abhorrent in every way. We dont need to change the law to put someone like Dr. Gosnell behind bars. In fact. hes behind bars right now. I think that the use of this case as a rationale for denying American women health care that they may need is terribly wrong. I would urge a ""no"" vote on the bill. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130055470,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. as my friend and colleague Representative SWALWELL has pointed out. the government shutdown is causing serious damage to our country. The shutdown is putting Americans out of work and hurting the economynot only the jobs of Federal employees. but the thousands of small businesses who provide goods and services to the government and to government employees who are not spending money that they no longer are getting in paychecks. This harm is being felt across the country by millions of people. The closures impact thousands of important programs and services. We know parks are closed. stopping travel plans. We know that the Small Business Administration is not lending to the tune of a billion dollars a month. Federal business statistics are not being released. leaving us essentially flying blind when it comes to how the economy is doing. Army Corps of Engineers projects are halted. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is not reviewing products to keep us safe. The VA is not able to decide claims from veterans. We saw the horrifying news earlier this week that death benefits for members of our armed services and their families were impacted. Meals for seniors are not being served. and children are being thrown out of Head Start. These are real issues. The economy is being held hostage. But what we want to talk about this evening is not just those impacts that have been so well covered in the press. but how our economys future is being held hostage by this government shutdown and by a lack of funding for science. We were very proud in the San Francisco Bay area that we had three Nobel laureates just this weekStanfords Michael Levitt and Thomas Sudhof and UC Berkeleys Randy Schekmanfor terrific success. They were funded not through the labs but through the National Institutes of Health. However. it is worth noting that this government shutdown is resulting in the furlough of 13.000 researchers. It is blocking hundreds of projects. The amazing thing to me was that their partner. James Rothman of Yale. who shared in the Nobel Prize. because of budget cuts and sequester. the research that actually got him the Nobel Prize was cut. Because of the sequester. the funding was cut for the research that got him the Nobel Prize. So there is an issue here not just on the shutdown holding the economy hostage. but also the underlying poor funding. But lets talk just a minute about the national labs. A lot of people dont really know what the labs are. Those of us who are close to them do. They were founded in 1943. and they were really meant to address the need to mobilize the Nations scientific assets to support the war effort. Subsequent to that. they were utilized to bring the smartest people in the country together to focus on things that would keep us safe. As a matter of fact. they have helped keep us quite prosperous. Out of the lab have come things such as optical digital recording technology that is behind all music video and data storage. communications and observations satellites. advanced batteries now used in electric cars. supercomputers that as a society we would be lost without. So much from the national labs. But one of the things that I think is enormously important and. unfortunately. has not received the kind of publicity it should have is the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. At 5:51 a.m. on September 29. there was a leap forward in the fusion experiment underway at that national lab. That Saturday shot was the latest in a series of carefully designed and incremental ignition experiments that have increased the yield. But here is the interesting thing. For the portion of the target. the 192 lasers that went into that target. there was more energy coming out than was put into the target. That has never happened before. So this is not the end of the quest to finish that science. but it is a major. major step forward. It is something that is actually threatened by this government shutdown. I just received a copy of a notice that is going out to Lawrence Livermore tomorrow. and here is what it says. from the management at the lab to all the scientists: This is to remind you that beginning today. October 11. the lab will begin shutting down normal operations. Only essential functions necessary to assure safety and security will be ongoing. The lab is shutting down. The employees are furloughed. as we have just gotten the most important step forward on this most important experiment going on in the United States. How can that be possibly be good for the United States of America? Of course. Lawrence Livermore is not the only national lab that is adversely impacted. Just up the road from my home in Santa Clara County. we have the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory. with their fabulous Linac Coherent Light Source. It is the worlds most powerful x ray laser. Its focused beam. which arrives in staccato bursts a few quadrillionths of a second long. is allowing researchers to probe complex ultrasmall structures and freeze atomic motions. They will be able to see what is going on at a molecular level in realtime. What is happening at the Stanford lab? The same cutbacks that are afflicting the Lawrence Livermore lab. Look at some of the things that are coming out of these fine science facilities. like the wonderful corkscrewing lasers that can be the key to unlimited bandwidth that was recently devised at the Stanford Linear Accelerator. and the national lab at Livermore that has developed a safe and versatile material known as DNA Tagged Reagents for Aerosol Experiments. It is going to be a critical tool for protecting the United States. All of these things are at risk. And for what? For a stupid. foolish partisan fight. We could change this this evening. tomorrow morning. All we need is to have a bill on the floor to vote to reopen this government and to allow these scientists to continue to move forward to change the world and to create a brilliant future for our economy and for our safety and security. So I thank my colleague. Representative SWALWELL. who does such an excellent job of representing the two labs in his district. as well as all the other constituents who are so proud of him here in his service in the Congress and for standing up for themnot just for their jobs. but for Americas future.
1130065871,"from California likes to say. effectively places two signs at our southern border: one says ""help wanted"" and the other says ""keep out""? That is the state of our current immigration system: confusing. expensive. job destroying. companies cant acquire the men and women they need to remain competitive so they are forced to expand overseas in other countries in offshore jobs rather than expand here in the United States. Thankfully. Mr. Speaker. the answer is simple. Groups from across the spectrumfaithbased groups including evangelical and Catholic Americans. businesses including small family farms to large international companies that employ hundreds of thousands of people. law enforcementall support H.R. 15. Based on the Senate bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill. that would solve all of these issues that we have before us. create jobs for American citizens. and reduce our deficit. And as we talk about the budget. at least frankly. Mr. Speaker. this week we are debating something very important for our country. In other weeks. my colleague. Mr. GARCIA. and I have taken to the floor when there has been nothing that has even been done that entire time that had any consequence to anybody. At least this week. Mr. Speaker. we are discussing something important. I dont bemoan that. I think it is legitimate to discuss the budget of our country this week. That is why I think we should stay here another week and discuss immigration next week. This is an important discussion. But as we look for what we call ""payfors""-how do we pay for making sure the Medicare reimbursement rate doesnt go down as scheduled at the end of the year. how do we pay for reducing the sequester. how do we pay for the investments that we want to makeguess what. comprehensive immigration reform would fill our coffers with over $200 billion of revenue. Now. how about that as a payfor for what we call the ""docfix"" and making sure we dont reduce Medicare reimbursement rates or any of the other items that are on the budget table this week? That is the kind of contribution that H.R. 15 and immigration reform can make."
1130075337,"language changeor after this bill passes. I think that we would all agree that this issue is not one in any way. shape. or form that is being put to bed here today. I would hope that. as a guiding principle. Members on both sides of the aisle look to consumer choice and the power of markets to achieve the best outcome and ensure that incumbents dont seek to coopt copyright law to the detriment of our economy and the detriment of consumer choice. Again. this bill has language that can be construed as applying copyright law in another area and having a congressional blessing to do so. which is why I encourage my colleagues to join Electronic Frontier Foundation. Public Knowledge. Generation Opportunity. FreedomWorks. and iFixit. and some of those very organizations that were in the forefront of proposing that we pass a bill that allows unlocking that have since withdrawn their support from this bill because of the lastminute changes. which I saw for the first time yesterday and that I wish this House had a bigger opportunity to vet. perhaps bringing this bill forward under a rule if the suspension motion fails. If a third of the Members of the House oppose. we would have an opportunity to remedy this bill under a rule that was hopefully structured to allow for compromise language that would then allow the bill to proceed with near unanimity. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle see that as an opportunity. certainly not as a rebuke to the chair and ranking member on the committee. We appreciate the direction and the intent behind this bill. their desire to make sure that Americans know that they are not under duress or a criminal threat if they are unlocking their own cell phone. That is a sentiment that both the chair and the ranking member have echoed passionately. but I think we can do better with regard to ensuring that this bill is also not a precedent for the use of overreaching copyright law and a congressional blessing to do so in a way that hampers the trade. the bulk trade of unlocked cell phones which offer great potential benefits to the marketplace and to consumers. So I urge my colleagues to vote ""no"" on this suspension bill. to consider working with both sides to get to ""yes."" and to move in a direction that we look at as a guiding principle. ensuring that consumers and the marketplace are allowed to fully operate without the cooption of copyright law to protect incumbents. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130079401,Mr. Chairman. in the committee report that accompanies these bills. on page 13 and 14. there are three items that the majority says that the President cant do. One is to defer action for the DREAMers. young people who are brought here innocently in violation of immigration laws. two. to allow the wives of American soldiers who are undocumented to stay and not be deported. and. finally. to allow parents who have been arrested for immigration to try and preserve their parental rights. Is it legal for the President to take these actions? Certainly. it is. In Heckler v. Chaney. as well as in the Arizona v. United States court decision. the Supreme Court makes clear that. in immigration. the ability to enforce or decide not to enforce is part of the broad executive authority. and further. the United States Congress has actually delegated to the executive branch. at 6 U.S. Code 202. the national immigration enforcement priorities and policies to the President. Now. is this anything new? No. We have paroledinplace Cubans since John F. Kennedy was President. In 2010. a bipartisan group of members. including Congressman MICHAEL TURNER and MAC THORNBERRY from the Armed Services Committee and myself wrote and said: Please. Mr. President. dont deport the wives of American soldiers. The President used his authority to do that as prior Presidents had done. The use of parole in place is delegated to the President and nothing new. Now. why is this important? These bills are drafted to keep the President from doing the things that he did to allow the children to stay and to allow the wives of American soldiers not to be deported. I think that what the majority wants to do is to not only have a donothing Congress. but to have a donothing President. When it comes to immigration. this is very serious. We have had one vote on immigration here in the Congress that was on Congressman KINGs bill to deport the DREAM Act kids. We have heard a lot of discussion about a bill supposedly that is going to be brought forward by the majority about the innocent children who have been brought here. but we havent seen a bill. instead. we see these bills. which would allow the Congress to overrule the Presidents action. so that the DREAM Act kids will be deported. so that the wives of soldiers who are in battle in Afghanistan would be deported. so that individuals who are caught up in an immigration problem would lose their children to social services. would lose their parental rights.
1130079535,Madam Speaker. either this bill does nothing because it is vague or it does something that is a serious problem. In the committee report for this bill. it specifically calls out as something that is wrong the DREAM Act. apparently suggesting that the DREAMers should be deported. Now. I dont believe that what happened with the DREAMers. the deferred action. was beyond the Presidents authority. And I have this letter here that was sent in 1999 signed by the late Henry Hyde and two Republicans who went on to chair the Judiciary Committee. Mr. SMITH and Mr. SENSENBRENNER. urging thenPresident Clinton to do the same thing that President Obama has now done. which is to come up with actual standards that are then applied. So I dont think that this bill should change that. But lets say it does. Lets say that we would have to report each time a DREAMer applies for deferred action. I think what we are talking about is that 500.000 or so DREAMers. their names and addresses. would have to be reported in to the Congress. Is that really what we want to do. to have all those kids be reported in to the Congress? Lets talk about another thing mentioned in the earlier bill. specifically on page 14 in the committee report. the socalled point 3. unlawful extension of parole in place. What the President didas prior Presidents have doneis to parole the immediate family. the husbands and wives. of American soldiers who are in immigration trouble. The reason for that. and the military asked us to do that. the last thing you want. you have a soldier in Afghanistan dodging bullets. you dont want that soldier worrying about what is going to happen to his wife. the visa got lost and she is facing deportation. and so parole in place was used. Now. we believe. and I mentioned. there is a specific statutory authority for that. section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. but apparently the majority believes it is unlawful. So what would this bill mean? I guess that all of the wives and husbands who are not deported. and I guess their little children. their names and addresses should be reported in to the Congress. So we have a little list here of people who are Americans in every way but their papers. whose husbands are off fighting for our country. but we are going to create a list of them. I think they are going to feel exposed and at risk. If the bill does anything. it does something very dangerous and wrong. We should not vote for this. I oppose it. I oppose the deportation of the DREAMers. as the majority has asked be done in these two bills. and I hope my colleagues vote against it.
1130081969,"Madam Speaker. I think what we are engaging on today has the potential of being truly historic. We need a vote on immigration reform. Several weeks ago. I was home in the district I represent. I go home every week. The Secretary of Commerce was visiting in Silicon Valley. She gave a good speech. After she finished her speech. she invited questions. The very first question was from a young mana scientistwho said this: I started a company. I am about to hire four Americans. But my visa is up next month. What am I supposed to do? As I was talking to that young man. another young man came forwardanother scientist who has just formed a company. He is about to go into a hiring mode. but his visa was about up. So when you take a look and listen to the people in Silicon Valley saying we are going to lose jobs in America because we have a dysfunctional immigration system. that shows the problem that we have allowed to fester. Recently. I met with farmers. They told me that they are not planting crops this year because they cant identify who is going to pick those crops. About 80 percent of the migrant farmworkers in America are here without their proper documents. Do I think that is a good situation? No. I do not. A number of years ago. when I chaired the Immigration Subcommittee. we had a wonderful witness. Dr. Richard Land. then the head of the Southern Baptist Convention. and this was his testimony. He said: We had for many years two signs at the southern border. One sign said. ""No Trespassing."" and the other sign said. ""Help Wanted."" Those farmworkers who are here picking the vegetables that we will enjoy at our meals responded to that ""Help Wanted"" sign. Sometimes people say you should do it in the legal way. Get to the end of the line. And this is from someone who was a former immigration lawyer. I used to teach immigration law at the University of Santa Clara. The truth is. there is no line to get into. We have created a dysfunctional system that does not serve American interests. H.R. 15 is not a perfect bill. No piece of legislation is. But it was a bill that attracted broad bipartisan support in the United States Senate. This discharge petition says just one thing: Lets have a vote. Why would the Speaker of the House and the Republican leadership refuse to allow this body to have an upordown vote on that bill? A discharge petition is something that has been in the rules of the House for many. many decades. It has been used occasionally in the past to actually unbottleup bills that the leadership didnt want the body to vote on. Most recently. campaign finance reform came to the floor of the House because of a discharge petition. A lot of Members of the House say that they favor immigration reform. Here is an opportunity to hold every Member of this House accountable. If you favor reform of the immigration system. you should favor having an upordown vote on H.R. 15. If you favor an upordown vote. we expect you. no matter what your party designation. to sign this discharge petition so the House of Representatives may have an opportunity to address this question and vote ""yes"" or ""no"" on this bill. I hope that members of the public who are aware of the need for immigration reform to reform a system that is not serving our economic interests. that is breaking up families and leaving children in foster care while their parents are deported. will call their Members of the House of Representatives and ask them to sign this discharge petition. It is in the rules. It is what we expect. We need a vote."
1130097980,Mr. Speaker. on behalf of the California Democratic congressional delegation. I rise in opposition to this amendment. This misguided amendment would prohibit additional Federal investment in Californias highspeed rail project. As we know. California is in the midst of constructing the Nations first truly highspeed rail system. The project was approved by a strong majority of California voters in 2008 because we Californians know that highspeed rail is the most effective and environmentally sustainable way to increase mobility across the State. Now. the project is already creating jobs for Californians. In fact. more than 70 firms that have committed to performing work on this project have offices in the Central Valley. and many of these firms. happily. are veteranowned. In San Jose. the California highspeed rail project is already providing immediate benefits by investing $1.5 billion in the Caltrain Modernization Program. This program will create over 9.500 jobs. over 90 percent in the San Francisco Bay area. Now. the governments independent watchdog. the GAO. conducted an extensive audit of the project. And you know what? They gave high marks to the authoritys business plan for highspeed rail. Members of Congress are right to conduct proper oversight of infrastructure projects across the country. However. regardless of your views on the merits of this project. I think most of us would agree that attempting to kill a single project through the appropriations process is bad public policy and sets a horrible precedent. I would note that electrified trains are really part of the future. China already has 5.000 miles of highspeed rail. and they intend to double that. Spain has 1.600 miles of highspeed rail. and they are building more. More than a dozen other countries have their own successful highspeed rail systems. Even Morocco is building a highspeed rail system. But we dont have anything in the United States except for what California is doing. I would note that California is almost always on the leading edge of progress for our country. We are leading in energy conservation. We are leading in alternative energy. and we have the best public university. the University of California. in the entire United States. We always lead. Now. it is important that the State of California has identified an ongoing source of funds to support highspeed rail. and that is the capandtrade funds. Is that appropriate? Yes. it is. because the capandtrade funds are generated through energy conservation. and the highspeed rail system is going to help move Californians in an environmentally suitable way. It is important to be visionary here. You know. when we started building the interstate highway system. when the first mile of highway was built. we didnt know that 50 years later we would still be identifying interstates to build. We need to begin with highspeed rail in California. California is behind this project. The California Democratic delegation is behind this project. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment. put our neighbors back to work. and allow California to continue building the Nations first true highspeed rail project. We will all be proud of that project as it nears completion. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130114031,Now. we know that this bill would eliminate DACA for DREAMers and make them deportable. but few in this body may know that the bill also returns to our bitter 2year fight about reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. It took this House 2 years to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act at the beginning of this Congress. and when we did it. we did it over the strong opposition of the majority of House Republicans. Todays bill undermines the basic premise of that act. that victims of domestic violence should be empowered to leave their abusers. It does that by denying the ability of battered immigrant spouses who have left their abusers and successfully selfpetitioned for a VAWA visa the ability to work for the months it may take for a visa number to become available. This one change will prevent countless battered immigrant spouses from ever leaving their abusers and will drive others right back into the hands of their abusers. Now. we have heard a lot of discussion about the law. but I think it is important to recall that the ability to make prosecutorial decisions is wellgrounded in the law. In fact. in 1999. I recall well the letter sent by thenChairman Henry Hyde. signed by 28 bipartisan Members of Congress. to the Clinton administration asking for the use of prosecutorial discretion. And most recently. the Supreme Court in the Arizona case recognized the broad authority of the administration to make decisions about whom to prosecute. The Arizona case reaffirmed the legality of the deferred action program. So all this discussion to the contrary is really nothing more than legal nonsense. What does this bill do? It deports the DREAMers. It reinvigorates the Republican war on women by forcing women with VAWA visas back to their abusers. This is bad policy. It is an outrageous bill. It is being done in the worst possible process. and I wish so much that the Republicans had reached out. taken the offer of our leaders to sit down and work together to come up with a solution that really works for our country instead of deporting the DREAMers who are so much the hope and future of our great American Nation.

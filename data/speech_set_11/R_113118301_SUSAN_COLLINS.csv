1130018084,Mr. President. I rise today to discuss a serious problem confronting the American traveling public and our economy. and later today I will be introducing a bill to remedy this problem. I am very pleased to be joined by several of my Senate colleagues as original cosponsors. including Senator MARK UDALL. Senator RISCH. Senator ROBERTS. Senator ISAKSON. and I expect several more cosponsors to join in this effort over the course of the day. As the ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. I have followed the issue of FAA delays and furloughs very closely. In fact. the first thing this morning I met with Secretary of Transportation LaHood and FAA Administrator Huerta to discuss this problem and my proposed solution. The challenges the FAA faces this fiscal year are daunting. Not only is the agency operating under a continuing resolution but sequestration compounds the problem. It is important that sequestration be implemented in a way that ensures safety and minimizes the impact on travelers as well as on jobs in the hospitality and airline industries. The FAA recently announced its plans to achieve its sequestration savings by implementing furloughs of air traffic controllers. closing contract towers. eliminating midnight services. among other cuts. I personally believe the FAA had other choices and could have avoided many of these disastrous outcomes. but there is no doubt that personnel does make up a great deal of the agencys budget and that some furloughs undoubtedly would have been necessary. Whether it was necessary for the FAA to concentrate so many of the cuts in the area of air traffic controllers is an entirely different question. In any event. my bill would restore funding for these essential programs and would do soand this is an important pointwithout increasing the funding for the FAA or for the Department of Transportation. Let me give a little bit of background. The FAA began furloughing 47.000 employees this past Sunday. including nearly 15.000 air traffic controllers. This is essentially 10 percent of its workforce. which equates to one furlough day per biweekly pay period for approximately 11 days through September 30. The FAA also plans to eliminate midnight shifts in more than 70 control towers across the country and will close more than 149 air traffic control towers at airports with fewer than 150.000 flight operations or 10.000 commercial operations per year. In addition. the agency is slated to reduce preventive maintenance and equipment provisioning and support for all National Airspace System equipment. These are simply irresponsible cuts that have real and detrimental impacts on the traveling public. on the airline industry. on the hospitality industry. and they will cause widespread delays to the air transportation system. It is estimated as many as 6.700 flights could be delayed each day. more than double the worst day of flight delays last year. In fact. there is one estimate that just since Sunday. 5.800 delays have occurred because of the actions taken by the FAA. This reduction in staffing of air traffic controllers has been the primary cause of at least one out of every three delays since the furloughs began. and the problem is only going to get worse. To give an example: On Monday there were 2.660 delayed flights. of which 1.200 were due to the furloughs. What is even more troubling is this is only the beginning. and soon we will be approaching the peak travel season. Some airports may experience delays of up to 3 hours during peak travel times. and we know these delays cause a ripple throughout the entire system. What is going to happen is that air travelers are going to decide to cancel trips and will not even bother to go on brief vacations because they dont want to spend 3 hours sitting on the tarmac waiting for their flights to take off. The FAA acknowledges these service reductions will adversely affect commercial. corporate. and general aviation operators. The agency expects that as the airlines estimate the potential impact of the furloughs. they will be forced to change their schedules. cancel flights. and lay off employees. At a time when our economy is already fragile. that is the last thing we need to happen. The legislation I am introducing with several of my colleagues. including Senator MARK UDALL. is called the Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013. Here is how it would work: It would provide the Secretary of Transportation with the flexibility to transfer certain funds to prevent the furloughs of essential employees at the FAA. and certainly air traffic controllers qualify as essential employees. Specifically. it would give the Secretary the authority to transfer an amount not to exceed $253 million to prevent the furloughs of the air traffic controllers and other essential employees in order to reduce flight delays and at the same time to maintain a safe and efficient national airspace system. Our bill would accomplish this goal by allowing a onetime shift of unused moneys in the Airport Improvement Program to the operations account. I first raised this idea of using the AIP carryover balances as a solution at our Republican policy lunch on Tuesday. Since that time. many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have indicated interest in this approach. I want to emphasize our legislation has been vetted by the general counsel offices at both the FAA and the Secretarys office. so we know it works. Secretary LaHood told me this morning it is an effective. workable solution. I want to explain further exactly how this would work. Each year funds are distributed according to a formula under the Airport Improvement Program to airports across the country. but each year there are moneys that cannot be used by these airports by the end of the fiscal year. Those moneys come back to the FAA in Washington. and they are then usually reallocated through a competitive grant program. Last year it was as much as $700 million that came back to Washington to be reallocated. This year the amount of unused funds is estimated to be approximately $400 to $450 million. So we would take $253 million of that $400plus million and use those funds to avoid these very damaging furloughs. The rest of the funds would. as usual. be reallocated to airports that need them through a competitive grant program. I want to be clear: This is the discretionary portion of the Airport Improvement Program. It in no way affects the entitlement funds that airports are guaranteed to receive. The program has sufficient funding to support this effort. Moreover. this is a onetime shift. It does not in any way provide a permanent change in this program. There would also be sufficient funds to fully fund and continue operating the contract tower programs. which so many of our colleaguesparticularly Senator MORANhave supported and been concerned about. This is a commonsense solution. It doesnt involve additional money. It is a onetime shift of unused moneys. It does not make a permanent change in the Airport Improvement Program. It will solve the problem. avoid the need for these delays. for layoffs. and avoid harming our economy at a time when we can least afford to do so. The Airport Improvement Program is a very important program. It does support infrastructure at our Nations airports. We are simply taking the unused funds that are generally reallocated and instead using a portion of these funds to avoid these disastrous implications of the direction the FAA has chosen. Our bill should be recognized as a onetime solution in order to avert these serious national impacts. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. and I hope we can act very promptly to solve this problem. Thank you. Mr. President.
1130018985,Mr. President. I rise to speak on the Marketplace Fairness Act. I applaud Senator ENZI for his many years of work on this legislation. of which I am a cosponsor. This bill rectifies a fundamental unfairness in our current system. Right now. outofState Internet sellers. socalled remote sellers. have an advantage over Main Street businesses. Main Street businesses have to collect sales taxes on every transaction. Because remote sellers dont have to charge this tax. they enjoy a price advantage over the momandpop businesses that form the backbone of our communities. This bill would allow States to collect sales taxes on remote sales. thereby leveling the playing field with Main Street businesses. It is important to recognize that this bill does not authorize any new or higher tax. nor does it impose an Internet tax. It simply helps ensure that taxes already owed are paid. I would like to engage Senator ENZI in a colloquy regarding the manner in which the bill is to be implemented. As introduced. the bill would require some businesses to start collecting sales taxes in as little as 90 days. I hope that my colleague from Wyoming would agree that is too short a time period. and I appreciate the fact that he has offered an amendment that includes a 6month delay. I believe. however. that a delay of at least 1 year is needed to allow businesses time to implement the new systems and software necessary for compliance. I do appreciate that the Senator from Wyoming exempted small businesses with sales under $1 million. as I had urged. Nevertheless. from a covered sellers perspective. complying with the Marketplace Fairness Act requires more than just installing new software. Multichannel retailersthose who sell online. through catalogs. over the phones. and in storeshave their own unique order processing systems. Tax collection software must be programmed to link to each component of their order processing systems. This step alone could involve considerable programming time for each online retailer. Each retailers tax department. or outside consultants. will be required to research and develop a comprehensive understanding of the unique sales and use tax policies in every State where their online customers reside to make sure the programming for their tax collection software is correct. That involves answering a number of questions for each State. The differing treatment of athletic apparel provides a great example of the complexity involved. In some States. clothing and athletic footwear are exempt from tax. In others. they are exempt only up to a certain price level. Yet other States make a distinction between clothing and footwear used for athletic purposeswhich they taxand clothing and footwear used for general purposeswhich they do not tax. In those States. systems must be programmed to correctly treat articles that can be viewed as either athletic apparel or general clothing. depending on the user. Board shorts. sneakers. and windbreakers are just a few examples of common items that give rise to substantial complexity. Retailers will need to invest additional hours in tax analyst and programmer time to ensure their systems are able to address these issues seamlessly. Even with a 1year delay. retailers will have to begin early. and move quickly. to implement the Marketplace Fairness Act.
1130025494,Mr. President. I rise today to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the town of Berwick. ME. As the ninth incorporated town in Maine. Berwick holds a very special place in our States history. and one that exemplifies the determination and resiliency of Maine people. While this landmark anniversary marks Berwicks incorporation. the year 1713 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. It is a journey that began thousands of years earlier with Native American villages on the banks of the Piscataqua and Salmon Falls Rivers. In 1631. barely a decade after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock. Ambrose Gibbens established a settlement at Quampeagan Falls and built the first sawmill in North America. That manufacturing heritage has remained strong in the three communities known today as The Berwicks. from the textile and iron works of the 18th century to the cuttingedge biotechnology and aerospace industries of today. Industry is only part of Berwicks story. During the Revolutionary War. the town provided two full companies to fight for Americas independence. more than many towns of greater size. The courage and character demonstrated by the townspeople in standing for liberty echo throughout Berwicks history. In the years before the Civil War. the many churches in town were powerful voices for the abolition of slavery. During that terrible conflict. more than 200 of Berwicks young men fought. and many died. so that all might live in freedom. The towns honor roll of current military personnel demonstrates an ongoing commitment to our Nations founding principles. This anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who. for more than three centuries. have pulled together. cared for one another. and built a great community that is a wonderful place to live. work. and raise families. Thanks to those who came before. Berwick has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are here today. it has a bright future.
1130034698,Mr. President. I rise today to wish the town of Freedom. ME. a very happy 200th birthday. The people of Freedom are proud of their hometown and the generations of hardworking and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live. work. and raise families. The name of this town is more than a word. it describes its history. Originally part of the Plymouth Patent. this community can trace its roots to the brave Pilgrims who came to the New World to secure freedom. Its first permanent settler was Stephen Smith. a soldier of the American Revolution who fought for freedom. When the town was incorporated in 1813. American independence was again under attack. and the towns namefirst Smithtown. then Beaverhill Plantationbecame Freedom. Decades later. when the Civil War threatened to divide our Nation and condemn millions to continued slavery. many young men from the town enlisted in the Union Army to fight for the freedom of all. One of them. Daniel Franklin Davis. became the 37th governor of our great State of Maine. And when the towns oldest citizen. Roy Ward. is recognized at the bicentennial celebration on July 5th. his friends and neighbors will honor his courageous Navy service during World War II in freedoms cause. Through the years. the people who built this community demonstrated the qualities that make freedom possibledetermination. energy. and selfreliance. They harnessed the waters of Sandy Stream to power mills for grain. lumber. and textiles. They turned the untilled soil into productive farms. In 1836. they established Freedom Academy. the first secondary school in their region and a milestone in the history of public education in Maine. The energy that so many have devoted to this years exciting bicentennial celebration is but one example of the spirit that has been nurtured there for two centuries. The restoration of such landmarks as the Stephen Smith gravesite and the Mill at Freedom Falls. and the dedication of the gazebo at Freedom Academy all demonstrate widespread commitment by the people of Freedom. Thanks to those who came before. Freedom has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today. it has a bright future.
1130077881,"Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2014. This bill would require the independent IRS oversight board to better fulfill its obligation to protect the constitutional rights of American taxpayers. The history of the IRS offers abundant examples of the agency trampling on these rights. In the most recent controversy. the IRS subjected applications from conservative groups that were seeking taxexempt status to heightened scrutiny. Delaying these groups applications suggests an effort to chill the constitutional right of speech and association by groups that hold conservative views. The details that have emerged are truly alarming. The IRS has admitted that it deliberately targeted conservative groups applications for taxexempt status for extra review if they included such words as ""tea party."" ""patriots."" or ""9111"" in their names or they criticized how this country is being run or if their purpose were to address government spending. government debt. taxes. or simply to make America a better place. Incredible. These inappropriate criteria stayed in place for more than 18 months and resulted in substantial delays in processing the applications of many different groups. In some cases. the applications remained outstanding for more than 2 years. The IRS also sought to compel some of the targeted groups to divulge their membership list. IRS officials have subsequently admitted there was absolutely no reason for agency personnel to have sought that kind of information. Such behavior. unfortunately. is not a onetime aberration. A May 2013 ""Time"" magazine article notes that the IRS has been involved in scandals going back at least as far as the Kennedy administration. which used the service to investigate socalled rightwing groups. President Nixon employed a secret IRS operation to investigate and audit political opponents. During the Johnson administration. the IRS targeted antiwar activists. In the decades since. civil rights groups. political activists from both the conservative and liberals ends of the spectrum. and whistleblowers have been subjected to intimidating and discriminatory scrutiny by the IRS. In 1997. the Senate Finance Committee held 3 days of hearings instigated by reports of IRS abuses. One type of abuse was the socalled Blue Sky Assessment. which thencommittee chairman William Roth characterized as agents making tax assessments that had no basis in fact or law. and were. in some instances. simply levied to hurt the taxpayer. Some witnesses had to have their identities concealed out of fear of retaliation for their testimony. As witness No. 1an IRS agentstated. . . . abuse of the taxpaying public occurs when the IRS improperly and sometimes illegally uses its vast power in the process of implementing some type of enforcement of the tax laws."" This agent went on to note it wasnt the IRS Code which abused taxpayers but rather how it was being implemented in an unfair. intimidating. and discriminatory way. I note these 1997 hearings in particular because they coincided with an effort to reform the IRS. culminating in the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. The act made a number of changes to the structure of the IRS and the manner in which it administers the tax laws. One such reform was the creation of the IRS Oversight Board. By law. the Board is charged with ensuring taxpayers are treated properly by the IRS. and the Board is designed to be independent of the agency. Of the required nine members. seven must be Senateconfirmed appointees who have professional experience or expertise in business and tax administration. The IRS Reform Act also requires IRS employees be terminated for violating the constitutional rights of taxpayers. The current IRS scandal was not. however. brought to light by this IRS Oversight Board. Instead. these abuses came to the publics and our attention through a May 2013 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Following the release of the inspector generals report. the Oversight Board released a statement saying it would work with the IRS and the IG. among others. to meet its statutory responsibility to protect taxpayers. That is the whole purpose of this Board. and I believe it should do much more than just work with IRS officials and the IG. So my bill would strengthen its oversight role by requiring reporting to Congress. My bill would ensure the existing laws. which are rooted in the response to prior IRS scandals. work as they should. It would require that the Oversight Board report to Congress each and every year on allegations of abuse. of taxpayers constitutional rights. on the number of employees who were terminated for such violations. on why employees against whom allegations were raised were not terminated. and on the effectiveness of internal controls. if any. that the IRS has put in place to prevent the unfair targeting of taxpayers. The IRSs history of abuses demonstrates that Congress must be ever vigilant in protecting taxpayers. The agencys power allows it to pervade the most sensitive aspects of Americans private lives. Irrespective of whether those singled out are liberal or conservative. Democratic or Republican. Independent or Green Party members. irrespective of their personal views. the targeting of private citizens for exercising their First Amendment rights is way out of bounds. It is illegal behavior and cannot be tolerated. It has been said the power to tax is the power to destroy. The American people cannot and will not tolerate any abuse of that power. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill and let us pass it to help protect the most fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution against abuse by governments ability to tax."
1130102094,Mr. President. I wish to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Town of Hiram. ME. Known today as a gateway to the rugged and beautiful Western Maine Mountains. Hiram was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today. Hirams incorporation on June 14. 1814. was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For thousands of years. the banks of the Saco River were the hunting grounds of the Sokokis Tribe. and the legendary Pequawket Trail was their route between the Atlantic Ocean and the mountains. The reverence the Sokokis had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is upheld by the people of Hiram today. The very name of the town. dating to the first European settlement in the 1780s. speaks of this reverence. Like the realm of the biblical King Hiram I of Tyre. the community was established among the trees that were its first source of prosperity. With the fastmoving Saco River and its tributaries providing power. sawmills became an important industry. soon followed by blacksmiths. leather manufacturing. and other endeavors vital to Maines development. As a junction of two of Maines early railroads. Hiram became the gateway to the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The wealth produced by the land was invested in schools and churches to create a true community. The history of Hiram is directly connected to the very birth of our Nation. One of the towns first settlers was General Peleg Wadsworth. whose company of Minutemen answered the call of freedom at Lexington and Concord. After a life of remarkable service to our young country. in the military and in public office. General Wadsworth settled in Hiram in 1807. established a farm. and led the incorporation of the township. It is fascinating to consider the influence the beautiful surroundings had upon his grandson. the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. who spent many summers in Hiram as a boy. A quality that runs through Hirams history is courage. Some 100 young men from the town fought to save our Nation in the Civil War. and 39 gave their lives in that noble cause. It is humbling to know that Pleasant Ridge Cemetery is the final resting place for patriots from four generations of the Lyons family who served with valor and distinction. Today. Hiram is a charming town of involved citizens. The historic Soldiers Memorial Library. built nearly a century ago in honor of those who defended our country. is avidly supported and remains a center of community activity. The saw and scythe depicted on the new bicentennial seal are reminders of Hirams past and indicators of the hard work and enthusiasm the townspeople have put into this years landmark birthday celebration. This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. it is about human accomplishment. an occasion to celebrate the people who for more than two centuries have pulled together. cared for one another. and built a community. Thanks to those who came before. Hiram has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today. it has a bright future.
1130105800,Mr. President. Today I commemorate the 150th anniversary of the town of Mount Chase. ME. Mount Chase was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today. and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hardworking and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live. work. and raise families. While this sesquicentennial marks Mount Chases incorporation. the year 1864 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. For thousands of years. the land surrounding Mt. Katahdin. Maines highest peak. was the hunting and fishing grounds of the Penobscot and Maliseet tribes. In the 1830s. the first white settlers were drawn by the fertile soil. vast stands of timber. and fastmoving streams. and the young village became a center of the Maine North Woods lumber industry. The wealth produced by the forests and saw mills was invested in schools and churches to create a true community. The incorporated town that followed was named for the prominent mountain peak. Mt. Chase. which towers more than a halfmile above the farms and forests below. The arrival of the railroads in the aftermath of the Civil War further secured Mount Chases prominence in the lumber industry. and the town was home to the largest coldstorage plant on the line for wild game and other perishable food products. By the end of the 19th century. modern transportation and the regions spectacular scenery and abundant wildlife combined to create a new economic opportunitygreat sporting camps and lodges that drew outdoor enthusiasts from around the world. Today. the people of Mount Chase continue to honor the strong land use traditions and love of the outdoors that have helped make such places as Shin Pond a favorite recreation destination for residents and visitors. In the early 20th century. the history. industry. and beauty of the Mount Chase region were made immortal by the great Swedishborn artist Carl Sprinchorn. who spent many years at Shin Pond. From his paintings of the strenuous daily life of lumberjacks to his evocative landscapes. the artist recorded a very special time in Maine history and a place that remains special today. This 150th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. it is about human accomplishment. an occasion to celebrate the people who for generations have pulled together. cared for one another. and built a community. Thanks to those who came before. Mount Chase has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today. it has a bright future.*

1130116680,Mr. President. I wish to speak in support of the Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act. legislation that I have introduced with my colleague Senator CANTWELL. Few issues are as important to the American people as the availability of good jobs in our communities. Unemployment in Maine and across the country remains unacceptably high. We must continue working together to identify ways to improve job training initiatives to help people find jobs in fields where jobs exist. I have met with many business owners in Maine who have jobs available but cannot find qualified and trained workers to fill these vacant positions. One way for employees to acquire the skills needed to thrive in indemand fields is through apprenticeship programs. Apprentices get handson experience that is invaluable to employers and can help workers secure a goodpaying job. According to the Congressional Research Service. approximately 44.000 individuals graduated from apprenticeship programs in 2013 nearly 1.000 of those individuals were from Maine. However. that number is likely insufficient to meet tomorrows needs. One manufacturer in Maine estimates that nearly 2.7 million manufacturing employees are expected to retire in the next decade. We must do all we can to ensure that an adequate pool of skilled workers is available to fill these goodpaying jobs. Our bill helps achieve this goal by giving tax credits to businesses that hire apprentices. To ensure that workers are given adequate time to prove their value. the apprentice must be employed for 7 months in order for a business to claim the credit. Our bill also provides incentives for experienced workers who spend at least 20 percent of their time passing their hardearned knowledge on to the next generation. These workers would be allowed to receive some retirement income early. without facing tax penalties. Finally. our bill ensures that the brave men and women who defend our country are given credit for the skills they learn while serving. Training received while serving in the Armed Forces would count toward an apprentices training requirement. This bill would help better align the needs of our Nations employers with potential employees to promote hiring and the creation of new jobs. I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill. and I am pleased to join Senator CANTWELL in introducing it.

1130010112,"Thank you so much. and thank you for your leadership. I really do believe when youre born you get a birth certificate. and when you die youre going to get a death certificate. and that little dash in between is what youve done to make this a better place. And I really want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus for your leadership. for what you have done being the conscience of this House of Representatives. a House that has lost its conscience. Now. I come from Florida. and our State now ranks number one in foreclosure. Why is that? Theres a direct correlation between if you dont have a job. you cannot pay your mortgage. And so the Congressional Black Caucus budget invests in jobs. I am so sick and tired of this House positionwhat I called when I was coming up-""reverse Robin Hood."" robbing from the poor and working people to give tax breaks to the rich. The Congressional Black Caucus budget on the other hand invests in education. saving the jobs of teachers and first responders. What else good does it do? It makes investment toward rebuilding our neighborhoods. and we all know that for every billion dollars that we spend in infrastructure. it generates 44.000 permanent jobs. Now. I want to say something about the fact that you can tell something about an organization or a group or your church or your club as to how you spend the money. Thats how you can tell. And you can tell whether you care about the children. the disabled. and the elderly. Coming from Florida. the home of Claude Pepper. I want to be very clear that I will not vote to cut Social Security. Medicaid. or Medicare. You know what? We did have an election. and I want you to know the people of Florida weighed in. You can fool some of the people some of the time. but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. And the people of Florida have spoken. They want us to work together. and they want jobs now. They understand that 20 years from now we need to correct Social Security and other things. but today when I go home. the only question they ask mewhether Im in the dollar store or the nail store or in churchis they want jobs and they want us to work together to bring those jobs to the community. I really do believe. to whom God has given much. much is expected. and we really need to expect more out of this House of Representatives. the peoples House."
1130051506,Mr. Speaker. today on the House floor. instead of putting an end to the damaging Republican government shutdown by passing a clean funding compromise passed by the Senate. the House Republican leadership has chosen to take a different path to vote on more political ploys. They are doing this by continuing to offer miniversions of appropriations bills in a cynical effort to give themselves political cover for causing this shutdown in the first place. These bills are political gimmicks. not a responsible approach to governing. Republicans have shut down the government and are damaging our economy and the middle class. And today the House is considering the following five GOP piecemeal bills. which only fund selected pieces of the governmentNational Institutes of Health. local funds for the D.C.. the National Parks. certain funding for Reserve/ Guard. and part of the VA. Like my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus. I wholeheartedly support veterans. our National Guard and Reserve. the District of Columbia. important medical research. and our national parks. However. these bills leave out many of the crucial services relied on by the American people such as Head Start programs. veterans cemeteries. small business loans. education for our children. equipping and training our troops. building housing for military families. getting decisions on veterans disability claims. among many others. Instead of opening up a few government functions. the House of Representatives should reopen the entire government. The harmful impacts of a shutdown extend across government. affecting services that are critical to small businesses. women. children. seniors. and others across the Nation. The American people have seen enough. and the time has come for Republicans to abandon their reckless and irresponsible agenda and join Democrats to honor Americas commitments to provide vital services our citizens pay for with their hard earned tax dollars. I urge Speaker BOEHNER. Leader CANTOR. and the Republican Party to end its shutdown by working with Democrats to pass a clean funding bill and end this charade immediately.
1130052069,"Mr. Speaker. lets be clear: God has blessed us with the best veterans in the world. You can fool some of the people some of the time. but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. The veterans understand that if they vote for this bill. it is a $6 billion cut to veterans services. So what are you cutting? The National Cemetery Administration. the office in charge of construction of VA facilities. Office of Inspector General. grants to the States for veterans homes. grants to the State cemeteries. All four veterans organizations said that there is a problem in the House of Representatives lack of leadership. Bring a clean CR to the floor. Lets vote it up. You are not fooling anybody. This is a Republican rightwing part that is bringing this terrible instance to this country. Theres no reason. Bring up a clean CR. A clean CR. I am appalled that the House is considering this bill that only partially funds the Department of Veterans Affairs. To take one small portion of the budget to help those men and women who have sacrificed so much and use it as a club to hammer the American people over the head while you argue about the Republican Government Shutdown. This bill cuts $6B from the bill the House passed earlier this year for a full year funding of the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is unconscionable. This is what this bill does not fund: the National Cemetery Administration. the office in charge of construction of VA facilities. Office of Inspector General. Grants to state veterans homes. Grants to state cemeteries. The Four Organizations that write the Independent Budget each year. AMVETS. DAV. PVA and VFW. sent a letter today to all the leaders of the Congress. They said that ""Both government shutdowns and continuing resolutions represent failures in leadership."" They went on to say that anything less than passing a full appropriations bill ""is unacceptable to the men and women who have served this nation in uniform."" Pass a clean CR and lets get back to the business of governing this country."
1130090782,Mr. Speaker. this week the House will debate and vote on a resolution authorizing a new Select Committee on Benghazi. Indeed. the attack in Libya was a tragedy. as is losing an Ambassador doing official work for the United States abroad. but using these deaths to score political points is politics at its worst. After 9/11. our nation came together to do what is best for all Americans. There were no gotcha politics. no hearings to blame the victims. instead. we worked together as a unified body on Capitol Hill to protect the American people. There have already been seven reviews of that terrible attack: one by the State Departments Accountability Review Board. two bipartisan reviews in the Senate. and four partisan reviews in the House. It certainly seems as though the Republicans proposed special committee is nothing more than an attempt to exploit the deaths of four brave Americans to divert attention away from their own donothing record here in Washington. Moreover. this new select committee is in reality. nothing more than a monumental waste of time and taxpayer dollars to help Republicans mobilize their extreme base ahead of the election. According to the Department of Defense in fact. they have already spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours responding to congressional inquiries. Nor will the new select committee have any additional powers that Chairman ISSA doesnt have alreadyincluding the ability to issue unilateral subpoenas for any document or any witness. authority he just used to subpoena the Secretary of State. To be sure. Benghazi was not the first time Americans have been killed in an embassy while in the service to their country. In the last 100 years. there have been 39 attacks on U.S. embassies with at least 44 American deaths. In one Embassy bombing in fact. a constituent of mine. Mr. Julian Bartley. Sr. one of the most senior African Americans in the U.S. Foreign Service. was the highestranking U.S. official killed in the August 7th. 1998 explosions at the American Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Tanzania. Jay. his son. a sophomore at the U.S. International University in Nairobi. also died in that explosion. On that day in August. Osama bin Laden and his terrorist group. alQaeda. simultaneously set off bombs at the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed. including 12 Americans. and 5.000 wounded in the twin bombing attacks: we were all outraged at these coordinated attacks on Americans. However. as Dana Milbank of the Washington Post put it: Benghazi doesnt qualify as a scandal because the Republican allegations. even if true. dont amount to much. It is indeed scandalous that weak security allowed the killings to occur. and that the perpetrators still havent been brought to justice. But Republicans are focusing on (United Nations Ambassador Susan) Rices TV talking points. under the theory that she emphasized the role of a provocative video and street protests so the violence wouldnt disprove President Obamas contention before the 2012 election that terrorists were being defeated.
1130093439,Mr. Speaker. as a senior member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. I have been on this committee for 21 years. I strongly support Secretary Shinseki and his leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is very important as we go into Memorial Day that we let the veterans know that we appreciate their service. We also need to let them know that we are going to do all we can to make sure they have the quality health care that they deserve. The VA operates 1.700 sites of care and conducts 85 million appointments each year. which comes to 236.000 health care appointments each day. The latest American Customer Satisfaction Index. an independent customer service survey. ranked VA customer satisfaction at 95 percent among VA patients. among the best in the Nation and equal to or better than any private sector hospital. Since its peak in March of 2013. the VA has reduced the benefits claims backlog by 50 percent. on track to eliminate the backlog in 2015. VA also implemented an automatic electric claims processing system to better serve veterans into the future. In 2013. VA paid out $66 billion in compensation claims to 4.5 million eligible veterans. Under the leadership of the Secretary. we also expand access to earned benefits for veterans of all eras. In addition. VA granted presumption of service connection for three Agent Orangerelated conditions. Let me just say that for years the veterans in this category have been trying to get assistance from the VA and they were denied. This Secretary stepped up to the plate and let all of those veterans come in. millions of additional veterans. Since 2009. VA has reduced the estimated number of homeless veterans. We have been trying to get them to do that since day one over 22 years ago. but this Secretary has reduced it by 24 percent. They have conducted over 6 million clinical visits with over 600.000 veterans who were homeless or at risk of homelessness. including the formerly homeless. In 2013 alone. VA served more than 240.000 veterans who were homeless.
1130097319,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in full support of H.R. 2072. as amended. the Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act. This legislation addresses a number of concerns that have arisen during hearings and other forums that we have conducted during this Congress. Too often. we have seen inspector general reports that find the same problem time and time again at VA medical centers. but nothing seems to change. Recommendations are made. solutions are identified. plans are made. but there is no followthrough. Problems arent fixed. processes arent changed. and problems reoccur several times over. This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general to determine whether appropriate action has been taken by the Department in response to a report concerning public health or patient safety. and if he determines it has not. it authorizes the VA IG to alert the Secretary and Congress. This authority will increase accountability and will. hopefully. get the actions needed for things to change. H.R. 2072. as amended. also addresses medical foster homes. It authorizes the Department to enter into contracts with medical foster homes to pay for longterm care for veterans who are already eligible for VApaid nursing home care. We know that many veterans prefer to be cared for in a homelike setting rather than in an institution. This provision gives them that option. The Department of Veterans Affairs has many homeless programs. and I am proud to say that we have done a great job in reducing the number of homeless veterans by 50 percent. Buildings in which these homeless veterans receive services must be held to the highest standard concerning safety. This bill would require per diem payment recipients under the VAs Homeless Grant and Per Diem Program to provide the VA with a certification of compliance with all relevant fire. safety. and building codes. It is our commitmentno. our obligationto ensure that veterans receive the best care and treatment available. This is whether we are fighting homelessness. ensuring the safety and security of facilities. or ensuring that when a problem and a solution are identified they get addressed. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130112216,Mr. Speaker. as the most senior member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. I strongly believe that the VA provides the best care for our Nations servicemembers returning from protecting the freedoms we most hold dear. and I am committed to VA continuing their critical mission of serving our veterans. VA has served the special needs of our returning veterans for over 75 years and has expertise in their unique health care needs. including prosthetics. traumatic brain injury. posttraumatic stress disorder. and a host of other veteranspecific injuries. My focus continues to be on ensuring that the VA retains the unique responsibility for the health care our veterans receive. regardless of the provider. The bill includes critical language that I discussed with Senator BERNIE SANDERS of Vermont to ensure the VA has the final authority over the care that the veterans receive. whether at the VA or at nonVA providers. We need to continue to work with our veteran stakeholders to ensure the VA has all the resources it needs to provide superior health care to our veterans. I am looking forward to working with the new VA Secretary. And I want to thank the past Secretaries. I have worked with past Secretaries from Jesse Brown to the present one. I know a lot of people will say that we have given the VA everything they need. But of course many of us dont have institutional memory. I remember the first time the VA got the real budget they wanted in 2009 under President Barack Obama. when we had a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate. So a lot of us talk the talk. walk the walk. but dont really roll the roll. So we have got to make sure as we move forward that we dont just talk about providing service. but that we really provide service and we ensure that the veterans have the service that the first President. George Washington. promised the veterans. And I do want to thank our chairperson. Mr. MILLER of Florida. for his leadership and the way he has conducted our meetings. and also our ranking member.
1130113097,Madam Speaker. Surface Transportation Programs are too critical to our economy to become a political issue. The shortterm Highway Trust Fund extension that the House is voting on today will keep workers on the job this summer and fall fixing our bridges. operating our transit systems and making our highways safer. Unfortunately. were already behind the 8 Ball in preparing for surface reauthorization and have some serious work to do in deciding how we are going to fund the future of transportation in this country. Developing a bill based on strong policy is always the best way to write legislation. but the most critical part of developing this next reauthorization bill is clearly finding a way to pay for it. Without that everything else is just talk. As we prepare for reauthorization of MAP21 we need to get serious about funding our nations transportation system. We cant continue to provide grossly inadequate funding for our nations infrastructure. Were failing to keep pace with our international competitors who are investing heavily in infrastructure. particularly rail infrastructure to move people. goods. and services in their countries. I agree we need to squeeze out every bit of efficiency we can through improved technology and innovation. but we are kidding ourselves if we dont think it will take a significant investment in our nations infrastructure to truly solve the congestion problems we are facing. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee needs to take the bull by the horns and decide how we are going to fund all forms of transportation for the future. Our committee needs to have all possible options on the table to address our current shortfalls. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given our nation infrastructure a D grade. That is unacceptable for the greatest country in the world. Transportation and Infrastructure funding is absolutely critical to the nation. and. if properly funded. serves as a tremendous economic and job creator. In fact. Department of Transportation (DOT) statistics show that for every $1 billion invested in transportation infrastructure. 44.000 jobs are created. as is $6.2 billion in economic activity. So. as the Transportation & Infrastructure committee prepares the next transportation reauthorization bill. I hope we can develop a long term bill with dedicated funding source for all modes of transportation so we can improve our nations infrastructure. create jobs and improve the economy. and provide new and innovative transportation options for the traveling public.
1130124863,Thank you. Ranking Member MICHAUD. First of all. let me just thank you for your serviceyour 12 years of service to this Congressfor what you have done for veterans throughout this country and also for working with you on transportation. I want to salute you for all that you have done. Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker. earlier today. I visited the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. where part of the facility is named the Murtha Cancer Center. Jack Murtha was a friend of mine. and he was the biggest advocate in Congress for men and women who serve in our military. I am especially proud of the visitors center at the Normandy American Cemetery in France. I had the opportunity to visit this center not long after it opened in 2007. The visitors center truly pays tribute to the soldiers who stormed the beaches. It gives visitors a true sense of what the men and their loved ones had gone through on that Dday. I am pleased to have worked with John Murtha. and I am pleased that his memory will live on in the Murtha Cancer Center at Walter Reed. I rise in support of this legislation. introduced by Mr. WALZ. to help bring attention to the horrible problems that are affecting our Nations veterans. I am pleased that my colleague introduced this legislation. which will require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense to arrange for an outside evaluation of their mental health care and suicide prevention programs. I am also requiring any servicemember who is discharged for posttraumatic stress disorder or brain injury or military sexual trauma to get treatment. Twentytwo veterans suicides per day is too many. One suicide is too many. Again. I want to thank Mr. WALZ for introducing this legislation. Last night at the White House Christmas ball there were cards available for Members of Congress to sign that would be sent to servicemembers this holiday season. I have placed these cards in the Democratic cloakroom and in the Republican cloakroom. and I am asking for Members who would to sign these cards and send notes to our veterans throughout the world.

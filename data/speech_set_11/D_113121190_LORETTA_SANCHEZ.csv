1130028235,fornia. I want to first begin by complimenting the chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces. Chairman MIKE TURNER. He has really been a delight to work with. His steady and thoughtful leadership has really allowed us to. I believe. make a good mark in this bill. Under his leadership. the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee worked in a very bipartisan fashion. We developed a set of oversight legislation and funding recommendations that I think really looks at cutting waste. shaping programs. and making sure that our men and women in our military are ready to go. First. the subcommittees portion of H.R. 1960 supports many of the highpriority recommendations and desires of the Presidents budget. For example. H.R. 1960 provides $8.1 billion for the F35 Joint Strike Fighter program. $5.2 billion for Army aviation upgrades. $3.2 billion for 21 EA18Gs and F18 upgrades. $1.4 billion for the V22. and $1.3 billion for the U.S. Marine Corps ground equipment. In addition. the Armed Services Committee increased funding in some parts of the DOD budget that came from the President where we felt that there were inadequate funds. Specifically. the bill provides an additional $400 million for the National Guard and Reserve equipment account and adds funding for an additional F100 engines by $165 million. and increases advanced procurement funding for 29 Navy F18 aircraft by $75 million. Beyond these funding increases. I want to point out that we made reductionsover $463 million worth of reductionsin this funding bill. Its never easy to reduce or to cut programs. but I think we did a very good job in making sure that as we move forward we will have the systems that we need. Finally. H.R. 1960 includes important oversight legislation. especially for the F35 Joint Strike Fighter. for the ground combat vehicle. for the individual carbine. the Stryker vehicle. and for body armor for our men and women of our military. All of these provisions are good government. and I look forward to voting for this bill.
1130083879,"fornia. Thank you so much to the gentleman from Texas. San Antonio. and New Braunfels. Mr. Speaker. today. we are talking about the Affordable Care Act. This is so. so important as we have seen this week 7 millionplus American enrollees. and I know there are still some who tried to get in at the very end and are in the pipeline. I am hoping we push even closer to 8 million new enrollees into the Affordable Care Act. It is interesting because we over here on the Democratic side have really been working to enroll peoplewe have been working to talk to people about how important it is to have a health care planwhile at the same time we have seen from the other side 50plus votes to try to undercut. to undermine. to eliminate the ACA. but here we are. They were repealing. We were enrolling. Californias enrollment numbers surpassed 1.2 million people this past Monday. which is more than double of any other State. On top of that. the expansion of MediCal. which is our Medicaid piece of this. has covered another 1.5 million lowincome families. so we are pretty excited. California looked at this and said. this MediCal planthis plan of having a health care plan for lower income families. for the members in these lower income familiesis so important. For the first 3 years. it is paid 100 percent from the Federal Government. So. if you are sitting in a State like California and if you have 1.5 million new families who didnt have health care before that was paid for. they were putting up with being sick. doing what we call in Spanish ""aguantamos."" If you got sick. you wouldnt go to the doctor. You wouldnt go and you wouldnt go. and you would work through. You would go to work. and you would be sick. You wouldnt go until. finally. you couldnt take it anymore. You were really. really sick. Then where would you go? You would go to the emergency room. which is the highest cost place in the entire health care system. Instead of putting up with not having health careinstead of aguantamoswe now have 1.5 million families who are in MediCal and. again. as of Monday. 1.2 million people who are in what we call our exchange. Covered California. This is very. very important. but there is also another piece of this that is incredibly important. which is that now we have to work with people. Now that we have enrolled them for the year. we need to work with people who have never before had a health care plan. They dont know what a primary doctor is. They dont even know what a specialist is. They dont know what the process is to go. They dont know about getting a baseline. Go and get an annual physical for free under these plans. This is for free. We have to teach them. So you go in. You get a relationship with a doctor. You get a physical. You get a baseline. You get your blood drawn. For someone like me. that is incredibly important because. for example. diabetes runs in my family. My granddad died of it. my grandma. my aunt. her five kids. It is 31/2 times more likely to be in Latinos than in the average Anglo in America. It is being able to go and get blood work done so that can you see where you are. whether you have the propensity to get diabetes. for example. because diabetes in over 50 percent of the cases can be stopped. it can be turned back. It is about having some nutritional understanding. being able to eat the right way. sequencing your food. exercising after you eatjust a 15minute walk. There were just two studies that were released this past May that said. if you have a propensity for diabetes but if you walk 15 minutes after you eat. you can cut that propensity by almost 50 percent. This is information that our communities do not have. Lowincome. immigrant communities in particular are less likely to have this kind of information. Now. if they have health care plans and if we teach them how to go and get that baselineget their annual physicals. get their pap smears. get their mammogramsand if there is something wrong. lets work on fixing it. and it takes personal responsibility to do that. I have to get up early in the morning and go and run. I have to go to the gym to ensure that. since the propensity is high for me. I dont get that because it takes some personal responsibilitypersonal responsibility not to eat pizza all the time. and things of that sort. yes. personal responsibility. It takes a health care plan. it takes knowledge. it takes access. These places have to be close by. We have to have clinics and doctors signed up into these plans so we can go to them. It takes cultural knowledge. as you know. being from San Antonio. Some of it is a language barrier. Some of it is just understanding how our community works and how we spread it by word of mouth. rather than go to computers to find our information. Knowing all of this will help us ensure that. now that people are enrolled. they begin to use the plans effectively. and when they use them effectively. we drive down that cost curve that was happening. In California. on average. it was a 17 percent increase in medical health care costs on an annual basis. That was not sustainable. The only people who could have liked the old system were the wealthy or the healthy. If you got sick. you had the money. or you never got sick. but today. we can fix these things. Today. we can fix these things by moving forward with these health care plans and with teaching people how to use them efficiently and effectively. so that all of society becomes stronger and healthier. and that is why we voted to put this in. That is why we have worked so hard. I am so thrilled that the gentleman from Texas wanted to discuss this issue today."
1130083881,fornia. I couldnt agree with you more. There are pockets of this. I just want to leave with one story. A few years ago. we had this one company who was a lensmaker kind of company. It was somebody who had retail stores. and you would go in and get your eyes checked. They would grind lenses and get glasses for you. Usually. they could do it in one stop. in 2 or 3 hours. et cetera. They said: Lets do this in your area. LORETTA. lets hold a health care fair. We had a lot of different types of people offering services. and they said: For the first 400 people who show up. we will have ophthalmologists theremedical eye doctorsand we will take a look and see what is going on with people. If we need to grind lenses. well grind lenses for them and give them free glasses. Because even if you had a health care plan. most people didnt have vision or dental. so people were not buying glasses. They couldnt afford it. I got there at 7:30 in the morning to this health care fair. It started at 8. There were 600 people in line already. so we gave coupons for these people to be able to walk into one of those retail stores and get the service for free. We kept the first 400. One of the young ladies that worked with me stayed all day with one of the doctors. making sure the patients were coming in and out. giving him the things he needed. et cetera. At the end of the day. the doctor turned to her and said: Do you know that 80 percent of the people that we saw today had diabetes or were about to get diabetes? They didnt even know it because one of the first symptoms for diabetes is blurry vision. so these people were thinking they are getting old and their vision is kind of going. but the reality was they were sick. They didnt know it because they did not have health coverage. and. like I said. that is a disease that you can really get rid of or eliminate in your life if you work at it. These people need that knowledge. These people need that ability to walk into the doctor and to get their blood tested and to see what is going on. so that we can tell them: if you dont change what is going on in your life. you are going to be diabetic. By the way. the plans before. if you had diabetes and you had to have your leg chopped off. for example. we would pay for that. You see what I am saying? We wouldnt be paying to let them know you may be getting diabetes or you have diabetes. we would pay after the fact to chop off their legs. Or. if they went blind. we would have them at home because. now. they couldnt work. So it is going to make Americans healthier. When Americans are healthier. they will be more productive. They will have less sick days. It will be good for industry. So I am really thrilled to have voted for the ACA. I am really thrilled. 4 yearsplus now. and that we are seeing it now. at the ground level. with people signed up for plans. and now. we have just got to make sure they go and use these. so that we can get them healthy.
1130091338,fornia. Mr. Chairman. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. innovation is important to our country and to our communities. Innovation and education is a step up in our economic situation here in the United States. A highquality education is a foundationit is really a foundation. not just for individuals. but for families. for communities. for our Nation. That is one of the reasons why I believe that it is important to have charter schools and to have charter schools compete well. to have charter schools thought out well. They are an addition to what is going on in our public school system. Mr. Chairman. back in my area. I have two very. very outstanding charter schools right down the street from where I live. One of them is the Orange County School of the Arts. performing arts. and aside from that. it has one of the highest academic levels. In fact. it is in the top 10 charter schools in my home State of California. As you know. we represent a large amount of people. 38 million or so. so that is saying something. I also have the El Sol Science and Arts Academy just down the street. That is an elementary school. What it has seen is incredible achievement. the close of the achievement gap for lowerincome students. But not all schools are high qualitynot all charter schools are high quality. and what we need to do is recommit to ensuring that those schools we have. both traditional public and charter schools. as well as private schools. do a good job for America. so that is why I will be voting for H.R. 10. My amendment. Mr. Chairman. would simply work to ensure that community involvement is happening with charter schools. That is incredibly important. I know that. when I went to school. community was involved in my public school. and that is why it was one of the most outstanding elementary schools in our Nation at the time. I am pleased to have worked with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle on the amendment that I am offering today. which will hold public charter schools accountable in fostering and promoting community involvement. Simply said. the amendment requires State entities receiving funds through the Charter Schools Program to report on how their allocations are supporting and enhancing community involvement. The voices in our communities matter. the voices of parents. of educators. of stakeholders. Lets not forget that it is those communities that send each of us here to the United States House of Representatives. So I believe that charter schools must be engaged with the local community to understand the students they teach. and my amendment will strengthen the role of community in the process. Higher community involvement in schools is essential to the success of the students and is also essential to the families of those students. So I believe that this amendment will help us in making that gap of achievement that we see in so many areas where charter schools are located. making that gap of achievement smaller. While charter schools are not the final solution to the educational challenges in our country. lets ensure that all of our schools are positively contributing to the promise of a quality education for every child in every neighborhood. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to improve this bill. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130093000,fornia. Mr. Chair. I thank the ranking member and my colleague from California. Chairman MCKEON. in particular. for all the work and guidance that he has given us as he leaves the Congress at the end of this year. I am sure we will fete you in better ways. but thank you for the work you have done. I want to thank the chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. Chairman MIKE TURNER. for his leadership this year. We have worked in a bipartisan manner. We have had three critical goals in mind as we have done this: supporting our troops with the equipment that they need. cutting wasteful spending. and investing in our future. The subcommittees portion of H.R. 4435 supports all of the highpriority acquisition programs in the Presidents budget. H.R. 4435 provides $8.3 billion for the F35 Joint Strike Fighter. $3.8 billion for Army aviation upgrades. $1.4 billion for the Ospreys. and $997 million for U.S. Marine Corps ground equipment. However. our subcommittee didnt just rubberstamp everything. We actually took a very careful look at what programs were working. which ones were slow. and what wasnt getting done. We were able to identify more than $600 million in funding that we put in other places in the bill. They were used to increase funding in numerous areas in an effort to provide additional equipment for our military and preserve critical production capabilities for the future. Specifically. the bill provides an additional $450 million for the EA18G Growler aircraft for the Navy. $340 million for additional ground combat vehicles for the Army. $80 million in additional funds for the procurement of body armor. $250 million in funding for the National Guard and Reserve equipment account. and numerous other investments. Finally. the chairmans mark includes important oversight legislation on numerous major DOD programs to ensure that the Congress has the information it needs to make future judgments. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
1130109468,fornia. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5116. the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2014. and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. This whole issue of human trafficking is one. in my 18 years in the Congress. that I have been working significantly on. I sit on the Homeland Security Committee. and one of the things that we were able to do many years ago was to direct funds actually into my area. into Orange County. California. to work on a collaboration of State agencies. police officers. and the Federal Government. and we funded this to make one of the first task forces on human trafficking in our Nation. Originally. there were six. and we were one of six. Now they are. I think. in the double digits. So we have learned a lot. We have learned a lot about human trafficking. We have learned that there are some countries that are initiation or supply countries. There are some that just transit these young people. these children. these women. We have also learned that there are destination countries or demand countries. and. of course. the United States is one of the largest demand countries. We are also a transit country because we take our own children from one State and put them in the other States. We are also a supply country because we use our own children in this human trafficking process. these terrible people who do this. They are really just. most of the time. about making money any way they can. So what we know is that there are many children being trafficked across our State lines. but also across our borders. They come in through our airports. They come in through boats in Miami and my State of California. and. yes. they pour across our borders just as we see the humanitarian crisis that my colleague mentioned earlier. So some of the people who first see these young children. for example. or these women who are being trafficked are going to be our Customs people. They are going to be our Border Patrol. As you can imagine. depending on the circumstance. they have got a lot of other things going on in their mind. They are trying to stem people from coming across. They are trying to figure out whether these people have drugs in their stuff. and so they may not notice what you can notice. and that is the trafficking of people. because in order to traffic that person. you have got to have the trafficker coming along with them. So. if we train them. if we give them the tools. our Department of Homeland Security. our Customs. our Border Patrol people. our transport people will have a better idea and will be able to see almost immediately. which is what I have learned to do through this task force that we have. The signs are always there. It is do we know. do we have something in our mind that can show us what is happening? Now. the Department of Homeland Security has obviously tried. but they have got a lot of things that they have got to work with. So by actually doing and increasing the awareness and increasing the training of our frontline employees. we will do a better job. We will do a better job of stopping this trafficking. I thank the other side for working with us to ensure that this bill moves forward and becomes law to give that additional training that I believe our Department of Homeland Security employees need and want. With that. I will reserve the balance of my time.
1130109471,"fornia. Mr. Speaker. I have no more speakers. If the gentlewoman from Indiana has no more speakers. then I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker. first of all. I would like to applaud Representative MEADOWS for introducing what I think is a very important piece of legislation in a bipartisan manner. and I am thankful that he cares enough and that he has a daughter who wrote a report. These people who are trafficked live amongst us. In particular. they live in areas where there is lots of diversity. where there are lots of people going about doing their business. in crowded areas a lot. Trafficked. you are right. they are exploited for sexual purposes. about 70 percent of them. but the other 30 percent are used in homes in domestic servitude not even getting. sometimes. to sleep in a bed of the very house where they are worked as a slave. sleeping on the floor and getting the crumbs off the table. We have seen that. We have seen that in Orange County. California. in one of the richest areas of the Nation. In one of the nicest homes this was happening with a little Egyptian girl who was there who had been trafficked in by a family. If it is not domestic and it is not sexual. then it is sweatshops where people literally have their passports and their papers taken away and they are working 18 or 19 hours a day. not being paid and barely being fed. So they are all around us. Americans have to open up their eyes. We have to see it in our neighborhoods. and. of course. we have to stop them as they bring them from other countries. That is why I believe that our Nations screeners and our Customs officers serve as the eyes and the ears on the front line of our ports of entry and exit from the United States. If they are properly trained. then they will see it. and they can help stop it. Lastly. I am very grateful that tonight we have had a series of bills with respect to human trafficking. I just want to remind my colleagues that this humanitarian crisis we see on our southern border. that many of those children also have faced what we are talking about tonight. and. in order to stop it. we have to be as generous as possible with those young people to restart their lives. With that. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to say ""yes"" to this bill. and I yield back the balance of my time."
1130109949,fornia. Madam Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chair. we all know that higher education is a key to the ladder of success in the United States. It is one of the most important things that we can invest in. We just recently saw a study that showed that if. in fact. you have a 4year degree. you are going to make significantly more than if you just graduated from high school. You can imagine that in todays worldat least where I live in California. the innovation Statea masters or a doctorate is really what you need to have. The value of a degree is very. very important. but we also see. of course. the student debt increasing. Students get out with their bachelors degree. have a mound of debt. and then they are trying to get a masters. a Ph.D.. or a profession. It is very. very difficult. One of the most vital programs that we have in the United States is the Pell grant program to help them. But lets face it. it is very difficult to understand all the ins and outs of how to get a Pell grant. how you use it. the purpose. how many units you can take. what you cant take. how long it can take you. et cetera. et cetera. So it is another burden that we are putting on the students and the families when they dont really get the good picture of how to use that program. My amendment would help spell out for students and families how that Pell grant would be used. It would simply require institutions to better counsel transfer students on their maximum Pell grant eligibility and the effect that it may have as a result of credits in courses that dont transfer to another institution. I know that. at least in California. when we look to go to the university. we usually say lets do the first year at the least expensive place to do it. and that would be our community collegewhich. by the way. they are the gems of our community. They are doing incredible work. But sometimes when students using the Pell grant get there. they might have. for example. some remedial classes. They might have to brush up on their English or their math. In doing that. the Pell grant is being used up. and then those units dont transfer to that 4year university they go to. So the student ends up miscalculating what it is really going to cost them to finish off their diploma. This amendment simply looks to make these types of obstacles obvious and transparent to possible transfer students so as to have the clearest view of their degree timelines and the impact on their financial aid. Lets ensure that students have the clearest information. that they get it upfront. and that they understand how they are going to get this done. In fact. a lot of these students are sometimes firsttimers in their families who are trying to achieve a diploma from a university. We are still miles away from getting that achievement gap closed in many of our communities. I know we have been working on it for a long time now in Orange County. California. but this will be a little piece of trying to get that. While I am at it. I would like to thank Congressman GUTHRIE. Congressman HUDSON. and Congresswoman BONAMICI. who have. in good faith. championed the work on this bill. I still wish we could get to the Higher Education Act. but if we cant do that. this is a good first step. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130117580,fornia. Madam Speaker. I rise today in opposition to this amendment. I dont take that lightly. I spent 18 years on the Armed Services Committee and about 12 years on the Homeland Security Committee. and with any decision like this. we have to weigh what we know and what we dont know. We know that. if left unchecked. ISIS would become a direct threat not only to the United States. but possibly to the entire world. That is why we are going after them currently in Iraq with partners that we know we can trust. such as the Kurds. We know that we cannot sit on our hands. close our eyes. and hope that ISIS goes away. That is why we need a good plan. We know that we cannot do this alone. that we need a committed international coalition to stop ISIS. The President says we have a coalition of 40. You know. it is interesting because I remember the Iraq war and the coalition. Some of our coalition members sent one person. I would really like to know who our coalition is and what they are really going to do before I vote for any plan. What dont we know? We dont know how moderate these Syrian rebels really are. In fact. some of my Syrian constituents. Syrian Americans who live in Orange County. have told me that there are no moderates left or. worse. that the moderates. given the choice between losing or Assad or ISIS. want ISIS. and they say people arent going to fight against ISIS. We dont know if somewhere down the line they will turn our guns right back on us. In fact. that is one of the scarier things that we have to face. We simply dont know who we can trust. In an uncontrolled. wartorn destabilized country. who do we trust? We can look back. for example. at what happened in Central America. how the rebels there. who were armed by the United States. went after innocent civilians. This blood will be on our hands when that happens. We need a winning strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS. Now. we are in an election season. Everybody says this isnt political. but I know. I have been talking to colleagues on both sides of the aisle. and some are wondering what they do 7 weeks away from an election. I have got to tell you. this is not a political vote. The last time people took a political vote in this House. it was on the Iraq war. and many of my colleagues say it was the worst vote they took.

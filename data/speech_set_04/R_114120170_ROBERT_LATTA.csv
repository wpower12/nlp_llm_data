1140009795,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 212. the Drinking Water Protection Act. which I reintroduced from last Congress in January. This important. bipartisan legislation requires the EPA to develop and submit a strategic plan to Congress for assessing and managing risks associated with algal toxins in drinking water provided by public water systems. Unfortunately. from the Great Lakes to other surface freshwaters across the country. algal toxins. produced by harmful algal blooms. are presenting a serious concern to human health and safety. Last August. half a million people in the Toledo. Ohio. area. including many of my constituents. werent able to utilize their public drinking water for over 2 days without risking potentially negative health effects due to a high level of algal toxins detected in the citys public water supply. During that time. concerns and questions were and have since been raised about health effects data. testing protocols. treatment processes. and appropriate short- and longterm responses. Furthermore. during hearings in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. witnesses testified about the further complexity of this issue due to the numerous other algal toxins and variants that may have potential negative health effects when present in public drinking water. I commend the work that the U.S. EPA. the State of Ohio. and others have done since the Toledo water emergency to ensure public safety. however. the situation demonstrated the need for a more strategic. comprehensive. and strong scientific approach to protect our citizens public drinking water. I believe H.R. 212 does just this. Specifically. the legislation calls for the EPAs strategic plan to include steps and timelines to: evaluate the risk to human health from drinking water provided by public water systems contaminated with algal toxins. establish. publish. and update a comprehensive list of algal toxins which the administrator determines may have an adverse effect on human health when present in public drinking water and provide a summary of those known adverse effects. publish health advisories and testing methods if the EPA determines it is warranted based on the published list. recommend feasible treatment options. enter into cooperative agreements and provide technical assistance to affected States and public water systems to manage risks associated with algal toxins. and identify gaps in the EPAs understanding of algal toxins. I want to thank all the cosponsors of this bill as well as Chairman UPTON. Subcommittee Chairman SHIMKUS. and all the other staff and stakeholders who have worked diligently on this important legislation. I urge the full support of my colleagues for H.R. 212. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140023057,I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate it. Mr. Chairman. I rise to speak on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over the NRC. our committee has taken a close look at the regulatory priorities and resource needs of the commission. The Energy and Power Subcommittee oversees nuclear energy. and the Environment and Economy Subcommittee has oversight on nuclear waste. I serve on both subcommittees. In both committee and subcommittees. we have held hearings in recent years with the commissioners on the NRC. as well as other experts and stakeholders. In these hearings. we have learned important facts such as. while the Nations fleet of nuclear reactors continues to operate safely. the evidence clearly demonstrates that the NRCs budget exceeds what is reasonably necessary in light of current regulatory and licensing needs. We have further learned thatand the NRC Chairman recently acknowledgedthe NRC budget needs to be rightsized to some degree. We have also focused on the fact that. unlike most other Federal agencies. 90 percent of the NRCs budget is recovered through fees on nuclear licensees. which are eventually paid through electric rates. This means that an outsized NRC budget is actually paid for by the American people. both through their taxes and their electric rates. We have also seen recent closures of nuclear power plants in the United States and fewer new plants coming online than anticipated a decade ago. In fact. even though the number of nuclear plants is currently decreasing. the NRC budget has increased substantially compared to 10 years ago. Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the Appropriations Committee and the chairman for acting to provide a level of appropriations for the NRC that is appropriate under the circumstances. This budget gives the NRC all it needs to ensure the safe operation of the Nations nuclear fleet without asking taxpayers and electricity ratepayers to pay more than is necessary. I thank the gentleman.
1140033729,"Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer an amendment. and I will later withdraw that amendment. The amendment I am offering today is a simple. commonsense amendment that fulfills a critical need for our Air National Guard. who stand watch while performing the 24/7 Aerospace Control Alert mission as diligently today as they have after the attacks on 9111. This mission is carried out by several Guard units across the country. including the 180th Fighter Wing in Toledo. Ohio. whom I have the great honor to represent. and by the D.C. Air National Guard. who are less than 15 miles away from this Capitol. These servicemen and -women also serve in combat theater operations overseas when they are called upon and play a vital role in fighting foreign threats. This amendment would provide funding for an additional ARC210 or equivalent radio in the Air National Guards F16s. These radios have a capability for secure lineofsight and beyond lineofsight communication. providing the ability to securely communicate with ground forces and command and control. However. one radio in the aircraft does not allow for the simultaneous contact with them. Currently. Air National Guard F16s only have one ARC210 radio that works on an ultrahigh frequency band. and it is this band that most command and control and air traffic control agencies use. An additional second radio will simultaneously allow Air National Guard F16s to communicate with command and control agencies and coalition troops on the ground in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and dense threat environments. Members of the Air National Guard. along with fulfilling their duties of protecting our borders against those who wish to do us harm. also deploy with our Active Duty military. side by side. on the front lines in overseas conflicts. In fact. the request to have these additional radios comes from the combat commanders in such theaters around the world. So not only is this needed at home. but also abroad. The Air National Guard designates the need to have this capability as ""critical."" My offset for this amendment is the Defense Rapid Innovation program. a program intended to take offtheshelf technology and put it in the hands of the warfighter as soon as possible. My amendment would do just that. It takes lowcost existing technology and puts it to work for our warfighters today. As I said. I am prepared to withdraw the amendment. but I want to say I want to commend the gentleman from New Jersey and his committee staff and all the members of the committee for their hard work on this legislation. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140065848,Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition to the amendment to strike section 4125 of the bill. which is language that Representative WELCH and I have coauthored over the past two Congresses with bipartisan support. It was developed with a cross section of interests. including efficiency and consumer advocates. manufacturers. and the EPA. By rejecting this amendment and keeping our language. we have an opportunity to encourage manufacturers to continue participation in the Energy Star program. Energy Star is a highly successful. voluntary program. Consumers. manufacturers. and the government all win under Energy Star. The program was designed to be lowcost and lowcompliance to incentivize participation by manufacturers. and the language included in this bill is needed to continue to incentivize participation. For a product to be branded with the Energy Star logo. it must meet certain energysaving guidelines. Manufacturers who choose to participate in this voluntary program make the necessary investments needed to increase the energy efficiency of their products. In order to ensure their products maintain the required levels of efficiency. the Department of Energy performs offtheshelf testing. If a product fails to meet the standard. that product is disqualified and then publicly listed on the Energy Star Web site. Immediately following a products disqualification listing. the manufacturer and the EPA will then work to resolve the cause for disqualification. It is important to note that our language does not prevent lawsuits from being filed. it just requires that a suit be filed before a product is disqualified from Energy Star. If a product has been disqualified from the program by EPA. the EPA is best positioned to determine consumer impact and if such impact requires any action on the part of the manufacturer. The EPA process is swift compared to legal proceedings. which could take years. If the focus is really on consumer reimbursement. shouldnt those fighting for consumer rights prefer the EPA disqualification process over class action litigation? In the EPA disqualification process. the entire reimbursement goes to the consumer. versus a legal proceeding. where legal fees can consume large amounts of the award. Energy Star has promoted economic expansion and job growth for participating manufacturers across the Nation. In defeating this amendment. we have an opportunity to continue to encourage participation by manufacturers instead of discouraging participation. This section has the support of the National Association of Manufacturers. the Alliance to Save Energy. the American Council for an EnergyEfficient Economy. and the Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Chairman. I would ask to reject the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140077230,Mr. Speaker. to Pat and Elvis. again. you have heard such great tributes not only at the funeral not too many weeks back. but this last week in the memorial service in Findlay. and with the Members here tonight. I will go back. I can remember Mikes first race that he ran for the Ohio General Assembly. I was in high school at the time. I used to drive my dad around the district. so we would run into each other quite often while we were campaigning. I know that one of my aunts from Putnam County thought that Mike was just about perfect. She used to rave about Mike all the time. That is the type of person he was. He had an infectious smile. a great laugh. and he could connect with people. As you have heard from many of the folks speaking here tonight. that is what made Mike such a great individual. He knew how to reach out and touch people and how to get those people to work together and make things actually work. One of the times I will never forget is back in 1981. after Tenny Guyer passed away. the election was taking place that summer. I was studying for the bar at the same time. but I can still remember everything that was going on. They were tough times. Having gone through a special election myself. I know what those things are like. Mike was one of those kinds of individuals that things didnt affect him. he just went into it and got things done. One of the things I mentioned just last week at the memorial service is what my dad taught me years ago. There are two types of people that get into public service. There are folks that want to be politicians and there are folks that want to be true public servants. He said to always remember what the difference between a politician and a public servant is. A politician is a person who goes out there and sees how much they can take from the people they represent for their own benefit. while a public servant sees how much they can give of themselves back to the people they represent. That was Mike. He was that true. dedicated public servant. With redistricting over the years. I have several of the counties that Mike represented. I can tell you that when I am out. it is quite often that I have people come up to me and tell me about something that Mike did for them. I dont care if it was Social Security. a veterans case. or Medicare. you name it. people remember those things because Mike was out there. He was a very caring person because. again. he never forgot the folks back home. When you talk about the folks back home. Mike never forgot his roots in Findlay. Hancock County. Hancock county is my dads home county. There are great people that live there. Mike and Pat were very. very generous to the University of Findlay and one of the buildings there. Mike. as the chairman mentioned. served on the Board of Trustees. He was very. very influential with his service. He gave of his time. He wanted to make sure he left things better than he found them. He did this with helping Miami University. his alma mater. and with the FindlayHancock Community Foundation. where Mike and Pat were so generous in establishing a scholarship. One of the things I would really like to talk about is that one of the things Mike really believed in was the Hancock Historical Society. They established the Mike Oxley Government Center. I remember the day the Center was dedicated not more than 2 years ago. ThenSpeaker Boehner came up. It is one of those things that I think people need to go and see. Again. Mike truly wanted to leave things better than he found them. He also believed the best way to do that is to educate our kids. There is an interactive center where people can go inespecially childrenand learn about their government. Mike said this is the greatest form of government that the world has ever seen. To make sure you have that government go on to the next generation. you have to make sure that the children and those students know what to do when they become adults. Sometimes it is too late once they become adults and dont learn these things. At the Oxley Government Center. it is in perpetuity now. The children in Hancock will have that opportunity to learn about the greatest form of government the world has ever created and make sure that it does continue on. He really. truly believed that our children are our future. To get into it again. as my dad said. you want to make sure that you are a true public servant. to give of yourself not 90 percent. not 100 percent. but 110 percent. That is what Mike did. Again. that legacy is going to continue on because the people back home will never forget it. As I am out in the district that Mike represented. as I said. I hear it from his former constituents. It is not that they just like Mike. they loved him. Again. Pat and Elvis. from the bottom of our hearts Marcia and I offer our deepest sympathies. The world was a much better place because Mike Oxley was in it.
1140098027,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 4775. the Ozone Standards Implementation Act. of which I am a proud sponsor. I would like to focus. in particular. on what this bill really does for the timeline of implementing ozone standards. H.R. 4775 focuses on efficient implementation of ozone and other air quality requirements by making commonsense adjustments to facilitate how air quality standards are implemented. based on practical experience. Our legislation provides States with additional time to implement the 2015 standards which is needed to fully implement the 2008 ozone standards. since EPA only issued the implementing regulations in 2015. Further. H.R. 4775 allows EPA time to develop the new implementing regulations and guidance needed for the 2015 standards. and also allows EPA to clear its existing backlog of hundreds of implementation plans relating to other existing standards. Clean air remains our priority. and this legislation does not change the recent new ozone standard of 70 parts per billion. It does not change of the standards set by the agency for any other criteria pollutants. Instead. it ensures that hundreds of counties are not unnecessarily subjected to additional regulatory burdens. paperwork requirements. and restrictions. EPA projects that. based on 20122014 data. over 240 counties with ozone monitors would violate the 2015 standards. but they are already on track to meet those standards by 2025. It makes no sense to sweep these counties into unnecessarily burdensome ""nonattainment"" regulatory regimes. EPA has estimated compliance costs for 2008 beginning in 2020 of $7.6 billion to $8.8 billion annually. On top of these costs. EPA estimates compliance costs for the 2015 standards beginning in 2025. of $2 billion annually. including $1.4 billion outside California. and $800 million in California. However. EPAs own estimate may be too low. since they have admitted that in some places. most of or even all of the technology that will be needed to meet this rule has yet to be invented. What this legislation postpones is the diversion of State resources from the most pressing challenges to meet a standard that EPA projects will be met anyway through measures already on the books. Mr. Chairman. I urge support of H.R."
1140102390,Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. I rise today in support of H.R. 4925. my legislation which designates the facility of the United States Postal Service at 229 West Main Cross Street in Findlay. Ohio. as the Michael Garver Oxley Memorial Post Office Building. This bipartisan legislation will honor a great legislator. friend. and former Congressman Mike Oxley for his many years of dedicated public service. Mike received his undergraduate degree from Miami University. which he was always very proud of. and he was always very proud of the fact that is where my youngest daughter just received her undergraduate degree this past May. He received his JD from the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. and after that. he began his career in public service as a special agent for the FBI in 1969. After serving with the FBI for 3 years. Mike was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1972. That is when I first met Mike. out on the campaign trail. Mike served admirably in the House until 1981. when he won a special election after the death of Congressman Tennyson Guyer. also of Findlay. As was noted. Mike served then from 1981 until his retirement in 2007 here in the United States House of Representatives. which he loved. In the 107th. 108th. and 109th Congresses. Mike was elected to serve as the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services. and he had many. many friends. but Mike personified what a true public servant was and is. He served his constituents from Ohio well and served the United States well. When you talk about what a public servant is. my dad always told me that a public servant is a person who sees how much they can always give of themselves to the people they represent. and Mike did that. Aside from his government service. Mike also served and was dedicated to helping others through his charitable works. As a team captain for the annual congressional baseball gamein one of them he got his leg brokenMike and his colleagues helped raise thousands of dollars for the Washington Literacy Center. the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation. and the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington. Mike was also very active back home not only with Miami University. but also with the University of Findlay. and he was also active in helping raise funds for the greater Findlay area. I would like to thank Chairman CHAFFETZ and Ranking Member CUMMINGS for their work in advancing this bill through the committee and to the House floor. I would also like to thank the entire Ohio delegation and other Members for supporting this legislation as cosponsors. Mr. Speaker. I urge the House to join me in honoring the memory of Mike Oxley by passing H.R. 4925.
1140104641,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding and also for having this Special Order tonight. We heard Dads time down here as 30 years. and I must have to also mention that was 30 years in the minority. He never served 1 day in the majority the whole time he was here. When he was elected in 1958. he served on the Ag Committee. and then went to the Rules Committee. In 1974. Gerald Ford put him on the Judiciary Committee during Watergate. a committee he did not want to serve on. but then he went on to serve as the ranking member on the Budget Committee until his retirement along with being on the Rules Committee. If I could just in the remaining time talk a little about Dad because a lot of people know about his work here. but also I think it is important to know that he was one of those they call the greatest generation. His younger brother. Lester Latta. was asked by his son what it was like when they were growing up. and my uncle had said that they didnt have much. but there were a lot of other people they knew that didnt have as much as they did. He grew up in a small town in McComb. Ohio. which had 1.600 people. which it is today. My grandfather was a barber. sold insurance. and was an auctioneer. He did anything he could to keep six kids going during the Depression. My grandmother wallpapered and did everything else and raised a family. Dad was the first to graduate from high school in his family. the first to even go to college. The thought of going to college back then was something that most people never thought about. Growing up. he knew the value of hard work. He would mow yards for 15 cents. caddied 18 holes for 25 cents. shoveled snow off the township roads with his brothers and his father. unloaded coal cars with a shovel. hauled corncobs. worked on construction crews building one of the high schools in Findlay. blocked beets. cut down trees with a crosscut saw for Rural Electric. sold shoes on commission for 5 percent. and he was also a prizefighter when he was younger. But Dad always knew what the value of an education was. He also knew what hard work was. One of Dads crowning achievements. and he was always very proud of it. at Bowling Green State University there was a scholarship that is still there. and 174 students have received this scholarship. One of the things my dad always told my sister and me was to always remember that you never want to think that you shouldnt have much education. because one thing in life they cant take away from you is your education. so get as much as you want. One of the things I always mention about here. and I would like to close on this. Dad always told me that this is not a profession my dad told me to get into. but I learned from him. Two of the sayings were that you want to remember when you go into public service. you go in with nothing and you should come out with nothing. He also said: Always remember in life it is not the big things you do for people. it is little things. because people expect the big things. not the little things. So I think that that is the memory that Dad had not only here. but also in the district. After Dads passing I had people coming up to me telling what my dad did for them over 50 years ago for some problem that they were having. But Dad always said to always remember that there is a big difference between a politician and a public servant. A politician sees how much they can take from the people they represent. while a public servant sees how much they can give back. I thank the gentleman from Ohio

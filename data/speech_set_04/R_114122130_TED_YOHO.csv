1140004955,Mr. Speaker. I thank my distinguished colleague from the great State of South Dakota. I rise in solidarity with the growing coalition that is united in the global fight against human trafficking. The numbers are overwhelming. We have all heard the estimates of over 22 million people being trafficked worldwide. sometimes. though. they seem far away. People often say: That kind of stuff doesnt happen here. It happens overseas. It doesnt happen right here. No. Mr. Speaker. this is happening in our own backyards. There is an estimate of over 1 million teenagers running away every year in the United States. Runaways are most at risk and vulnerable to trafficking. In fact. runaways are typically picked up and pimped out or trafficked within the first 48 hours. Just 5 days ago in my home State of Florida. a 15yearold girl was discovered by police in a motel being sexually abused and trafficked several times a day. Her parents had been handing out missing child flyers in the neighborhood. Luckily. someone recognized her picture from an online ad and contacted authorities. That young girl went from being a runaway to a trafficking victim in less than a month. That precious 15yearold child could have been anybodys child. It could have been yours or mine. However. it is not just runaways that become victims of trafficking. Traffickers dont discriminate based on economic class. race. gender. or age. Traffickers are motivated by profit. solely profit. The average cost of a slave worldwide is roughly $90. Human trafficking is a $30plus billion industry. and it is the second largest source of revenue for terrorists around the world. As the worlds fastest growing criminal enterprise. it is shocking how little people know about this horrendous practice. Furthermore. it is appalling how little is put forward in effort to stop it. This week. the House of Representatives will pass a series of bills designed to streamline law enforcement resources. toughen penalties for offenders. and provide resources to victims. I commend the sponsors of these bills as well as all Members up here today who are willing to stand up and say enough is enough. Human trafficking is not a Republican or Democrat issue. Taking a stand against trafficking is something we all must do. remembering that. while January is National Human Trafficking Awareness Month. we must all be vigilant and active in our fight. No. Mr. Speaker. your neighborhood and my neighborhood are not immune. No city is exempt. and these victims are part of our daily lives. quietly suffering with almost nowhere to turn. We cannot in good conscience continue our daily routines without making every effort to stamp out the practice of forced labor. domestic servitude. and sex trafficking. I encourage all Americans to go to the Department of Homeland Securitys Web site and watch the Blue Campaign video to become familiar with the common signs of human trafficking. Lets all work to stomp out this scourge of activity on humanity.
1140039213,"Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank Chairman CALVERT. along with the ranking member. for the work he and the committee have done. My amendment prevents the EPA from using any funds in the bill to change ozone regulations. regardless of whether or not all counties meet the 2008 standards. As of 2012 and based on the 2008 ozone standards as designated by the EPA. 24 mainland States were in attainment. including my home State of Florida. An additional four States had either partial attainment or whole counties had marginal attainment. What I find most interesting is the areas of our Nation that have consistently been designated as nonattainment by the EPA. This includes most of California. parts of Texas. and the midAtlantic States. These counties have had nearly 20 years to change their policies and abide by the ozone standards. Under the newly proposed standards. a fair amount of the country would be designated as nonattainment areas. Why should the remainder of the country be subject to new standards when parts of the country have yet to meet the 2008 or even 2009 standards? Making this change will have serious economic implications on the States and counties that have already proactively worked to reduce their emissions. all at a time when the Nation is still recovering from one of the worst economic recessions of our lifetime. Furthermore. I would like to remind my colleagues of the recent Supreme Court decision. Michigan. et al.. v. Environmental Protection Agency. At the heart of the case was whether or not the EPA took care to include the potential cost to power plants when proposing new regulations. and that estimated cost is $9.6 billion and a burden on the American taxpayers. The Supreme Court held that the EPA interpreted U.S. Code 7412 ""unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision."" I would like to say that this is the exception and not the rule when it comes to the EPA. but that simply is not the truth. The EPA has made its de facto policy to implement unreasonable regulations with no regard to the larger impact it will have on the economy and taxpayers and the environment. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140071390,"Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague. Mr. STUTZMAN. for putting this important Special Order together. Yesterday. President Obama moved unilaterally. via executive order. in a misguided attempt to curb gun violence in America. He stated he had to take unilateral action because the Congress refused to support his initiatives. That is true. somewhat. but not because this Nation wishes to curb gun violence that has fallen upon innocent victims of Americavictims like Kathryn Stienle. This young lady was murdered in San Francisco by a person here illegallya person that had been deported over four times and should have been deported once again. but instead was allowed to stay in this country illegally because of this Presidents policies and the policies promoted by sanctuary cities like San Francisco. Obviously. I cannot speak for her family. but I would venture to say her family would have had a very different holiday this year than the one they experienced had the justice system not failed them and the man who murdered her had been deported. She would be here today if the President and his administration had chosen to simply enforce the laws on the books. President Obamas executive order will not curb this kind of violence. Only the enforcement of the laws will. And. Mr. President. you know this. Please abide by article II. section 3 of our Constitution: The executive shall faithfully execute the laws of the land. Now. I agree with the President that we should appropriate more money to mental health. as has been talked about here tonight. The lack of resources for those seeking mental health in this country is abysmal. Thirty years ago. this Nation had over 500.000 hospital bed facilities for mental health care. Today. there are less than 50.000. This is inexcusable. I also agree with the President that we should increase the number of ATF inspectors to process background checks more quickly and more efficiently. We can work this out through the legislative processthe way it should be doneand not through. again. executive fiat. With all due respect. Mr. President. your phone and pen are not a substitute for the other two branches of government. Aside from sidestepping Congress again. your other initiatives encroach on Americans personal liberties and freedoms. Take. for example. your plan to revoke gun ownership from folks whose oversight of their finances are turned over to someone elsespecifically. those receiving disability through the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs. For reasons beyond their control. sometimes additional help is needed in managing ones finances. Sometimes they do it voluntarily. This does not mean they are incapable of making sound. moral decisions. and certainly does not mean their Second Amendment rights can and should be infringed upon. As an aside. I want to highlight how this Presidents administration allowed for Syrian rebels to receive military grade weapons and they supplied Mexican drug cartels with weapons through the failed Fast and Furious program administered under Attorney General Eric Holder at the time. All of this has been done irresponsibly and without conducting background checks. This administrations gun policies have killed innocent people. Customs and Border Security Agent Brian Terry was a victim of this. Yet this Presidents solution to gun violence is to restrict lawabiding American citizens from one of our most basic rights of American freedom and liberty. It simply does not make sense. The Second Amendment of our Constitution is very clear and concise. Allow me to read it: ""A well regulated militia. being necessary to the security of a free state. the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" This amendment was not added in the early years of our Nations founding for hunting or sporting purposes. but for personal protection to fend off an overbearing. tyrannical government. It is very clear and has consistently been upheld by the Supreme Court. Mr. President. I understand and sympathize with your frustrations. but please uphold the Constitution and come to Congress. Lets work together on those areas where we agree upon to curb gun violence. And lets preserve the Second Amendment. Lets all respect and revere the Constitution for all Americans."
1140085544,I would like to thank my colleague for those kind words. Mr. Speaker. I would like to take just a quick moment to add to the important work that Mr. KING is doing and to thank my colleague for yielding me the time and for his continued leadership in the fight to ensure the dignity of the Supreme Court so that it is not undermined by the nomination and subsequent appointment of a Justice whose judicial ideologies run counter to the Founders constitutional principles. as you have spoken so eloquently about. The United States of America. the great American experiment. is an experiment that has surpassed centuries of speculation and persisted through the Civil War. an experiment that survived two World Wars and continues to stand as a beacon of hope to nations across the globe. an experiment made possible because of the foresight of our Founding Fathersand it had to have some divine intervention because men just arent that smart. so there was wisdomwho recognized the necessity to establish a government ruled by a series of laws they felt were so essential to ensure equal opportunitynot equal outcome. but equal opportunityin the pursuit of prosperity and happiness to all citizens. These documentsthe United States Constitution and the Bill of RightsI have right here. I want people to look at this. This is the entire Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. I think if you look at it. we will all agree it is not an epic in volume. Even my colleague across the aisle recognizes that. It is not an epic in volume. but yet it is an epic in the ideology of what America stands for. And it stands for opportunity. And if you put work behind that. it becomes the American Dream. your American Dream. The very fabric of this country is our core value. our founding principles. and the Constitution that preserves this. And that is the very document that gives people on the left the voice of dissension. as it does people on the right. And if we lose thisthese principleswe lose that very argument. the very thing that made America great. And I ask you: Are those ideologies Republican or Democrat. conservative. liberal. White. Black. or any other adjective you want to throw in there? And I would venture to say that you would all say no. they are American ideologies. That is why this discussion is so important. The United States is facing an unprecedented attack by activist justices in both the lower and upper courts. If leaders were to yield to the demands of President Obama or any other executive in the future. and nominate any individual who does not have a true. tried. and tested conservative record on constitutional issues. the ensuing Supreme Court opinions could be detrimental to constitutional law for years. if not decades. to come. And I would surmise that if we cross that bridge and go beyond the constitutional principles of this country. what America is. what it has been in the past. and what we hope it to be in the future may be lost in the history of time. While I fully understand the importance of having a full Bench and all nine Justices available to hear some of the most critical cases of our time. it should not be done at the expense of our Constitution. That is a document we all should revere. We all should stand up and protect it. After all. dont we all give an oath to uphold that sacred document? As American culture has ebbed and flowedand it will continue tomorphing into what it is today. it was these founding documents that fostered an environment where the voice of the few. not just the many. could be heard. And that is the beauty of our country: a constitutional Republic. So many people want to refer to it as a democracy. A democracy is majority rule. A democracy is mob rule. And as Ben Franklin was often quoted: Democracy is the same as two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for lunch. As we know. in that story. the sheep always loses. So that is why it is so important. because a constitutional Republic protects the rights of the minority. of all people. American culture. as I said. has ebbed and flowed over the period of time and it is morphing and will continue to morph. They have allowed for the people to dictate change. not a man who likes to remind the American people that he believes he can rewrite our history and. through the use of his phone and a pen. direct executive agencies to act with disregard to the voice of the people. A pen and a phone are not a replacement for the legislative body. And it is the Senates chore to pick that person. Take. for example. a vital case about to be argued before the Supreme Court next week: United States v. Texas. To some. this may seem like a simple antiimmigration or. in some cases. a proimmigration case. But at its core. it is not about whether or not you are anti- or proimmigration. It is about whether or not the Supreme Court will allow the executive branch to circumvent Congress and legislate from the Oval Office rather than through Capitol Hill. the way it was intended by our Founders. I believe the Constitution is clear on this issue. but I also believe any Justice who does not have a deep appreciation for the Constitution. as the late Justice Scalia did. would disagree with me. Therein lies the danger: any Justice who is willing to tip the scale in the balance of power in favor of a runaway Presidential office. And it is not just this administration. It could be any in the future. And that is why this is so important. This crosses party lines. It is a political ideology that I would argue threatens the very fabric of the foundation and the founding of our Nation. Congress cannot allow itself to cave and settle for a Justice that would be complacent in the destruction of the Constitution and ultimately the destruction of the great American experiment. [ 1715 I challenge the President to get serious with this nomination and put forth the name of a Justice that will uphold the constitutional principles and not legislate from the bench. In the meantime. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to hold steadfast and not allow themselves to be persuaded by public opinion. public pressure. and by those who will try to pressure them to vote for any nominee who will do the American legacy and the American people an injustice by undermining the Constitution from the highest court in this great Nation. This discussion is so important. The very fabric of this discussion and the very basis of this discussion is about the preservation of this institution. That is what this is about. If you look at a timeline of human history and you look at the American experiment. it is but a dot on that period of time. but it has created the greatest country in the world. The reason that has been allowed is because of the Constitution. Again. those ideologies arent Republican. they are not Democrat. They are American ideologies so that we will all benefit. And we all have a hand to preserve those. We can have our differences. but this is one thing we shouldnt differ on. and this is for the posterity of all Americans: conservatives. liberals. White. Black. anybody else. This is something we stand strong on. and I appreciate the gentleman from Iowa. my colleague and mentor.
1140086207,"Mr. Speaker. if Congress does not assert its constitutional authority. we risk becoming obsolete in the eyes of an Executive that would prefer to legislate with a phone and a pen as a replacement for this body. Thank you to all my colleagues who join me this evening. and may God bless America. Every day. before Members of Congress meet to conduct official business. we gather to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States of America. We place our right hand over our hearts and promise to our colleagues. our constituents. and all Americans that we will uphold the rule of law. This very law is the very vehicle that has ensured liberty and justice for all even being a possibility: the rule of law. Unfortunately. this administration seems intent on operating outside the rule of law. It insists upon circumventing Congress by changing laws and legislating from the Oval Office. not from Capitol Hill. Time and again. the American people have had to bear witness to the blatant disrespect this administration has for our Constitution. In my heart. I believe this disrespect is on full display in the embattled fight Congress and the American people find themselves in today with the executive branch at the Supreme Court. This morning. the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the United States v. Texas case. including 25 other States. To some. this case is simply an argument over whether or not you are proillegal immigration. Let me repeat that. You are proillegal immigration or not. To others. this case is about keeping families together. To many. like myself. it is about protecting the dignity of our Constitution and the balance of powers within the three branches of government. The United States v. Texas is about the rule of law and defending the integrity of our great institution of government. We are a constitutional Republic. And yet. the Presidents mass deferred action on deportation of individuals residing within our country illegally would make it seem more like we are living in a dictatorship. The Constitution is clear on the issues of legislation. Article I. section 1 explicitly states: ""All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States. which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives."" Let that sink in for a moment. ""All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States. which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives."" Article I. section 8. clause 4: ""to establish a uniform rule of naturalization."" That is solely the responsibility of this body. Take notice of the absence of any reference to the executive office. executive branch. or judicial branch. Article II. section 3. however. states that the President ""shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" It is referred to as the Take Care Clause. That the laws be faithfully executed. not established. not rewritten. not selectively enforce portions of law. but to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. [ 2045 That power is still delegated to Congress just as it was over two centuries ago. If the Supreme Court upholds the administrative executive action. I fear that our Republicthat is the United Stateswill die. We will see an end of a Nation that started by fending off tyranny. We will see the end of a Nation which has withstood a civil war. two world wars. and countless terrorist attacks. Terrorists hate the United States simply because of the manner through which we have prospered under the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. Again. the success of our Nation is because we are a land and a Nation of laws. I urge all of my colleagues in the House and the Senate to not falter in their defense of the founding principles upon which this great Nation was built. Interesting. today. at the Supreme Court. I was there to speak on these very topics. Many proillegal immigrants were present. and I found it very interesting they were shouting. demonstrating. exercising freedom of speech. freedom of speech and demonstrating in America. simply because we have a Constitution that protects that. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia . my good friend and colleague."
1140086319,"Madam Speaker. it is a great day here in America. Four years ago I came to Congress with a desire to change the businessasusual politics in Washington. D.C. That road has been tough. but change has been achieved. My efforts. along with the efforts of likeminded colleagues. changed the leadership of this House for the better. There has been a renewed work ethic and excitement to set forth an agenda for the American people that puts them first. not Big Government. not Big Business. There is truth in the saying: Do not grow weary in well doing. Madam Speaker. with positive incremental changes taking hold. the keystone to our success will be a change in leadership at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Our current administration has done everything it can to avoid working with Congress. Time and again. Republicans have sent legislation to the Presidents desk on behalf of the American people. only to have each one of them vetoed. With every veto. the President casts aside the will of the very people who elected us to serve. telling them. essentially: I know what is best for you. Or he rules with a pen and a phone. Every Member of Congress takes their work and the work of the American people seriously as Representatives and as a legislative body. If this administration. in their remaining time in office. doesnt want to work with Congress on anything. then the Republicans in the House and the Senate must take action to address the issues facing the American people. Due to the Presidents policy of stonewalling Congress. the legislation that we have passed has no chance of gaining his signature. Compromise. once accepted as a means to accomplish the greater good. now seems to be a thing of the past. The executive branch. whether held by Democrats or Republicans. has grown accustomed to exercising unilateral power to reinterpret existing law and twist it to fit its own ideology. Again. I want to repeat. The executive branch. whether held by Republicans or Democrats. has used that power and twisted it to fit its own ideology. Congress has no answer to the authoritative rulemaking process used by government agencies today. Madam Speaker. we need to reestablish a check on those agencies that are willingly disrupting business across America. I am not talking about rules that were crafted with an understanding of the industry and a truly thoughtful process which included all stakeholders. I am talking about the rules. like the Clean Power Plan. endorsed by radical environmental groups with no reasonable knowledge of what affordable energy means to people who live paycheck to paycheck and follow an ideology of their own. To blunt these rules. Congress must have a tool that truly is a check on the executive. one that forces the executive and legislative branch to work things out together. One tool that scholars repeatedly pay lip service to is the power of the purse. We talk about it all the time. but we dont see it in action. While historically being an important tool to enforce the will of Congress. nowadays. a fight over spending devolves into a blame game over shutting down the government. It is a black eye to our system of government. it is a black eye to the notion of stability. and it is an insult to the American people and furthers the dysfunction of this great institution. The balance of power in our government is out of alignment. and it is up to us in Congress to reclaim what used to be oursthe legislative veto. The legislative veto used to be a potent check on the executive branch for the better part of the 20th century. However. a broad ruling by the United States Supreme Court in 1983. INS v. Chadha. nullified the legislative veto in over 280 statutes. This was a sweeping decision. one that both handed more authority to the executive branch while limiting Congress ability to stand up to Federal bureaucracies. In his dissent. Justice Byron White. who was nominated to the Court by President Kennedy. correctly identified the fallout from the decision. and I quote: ""Without the legislative veto. Congress is faced with a Hobsons choice: either to refrain from delegating the necessary authority. leaving itself with a hopeless task of writing laws with the requisite specificity to cover endless special circumstances across the entire policy landscape or. in the alternative. to abdicate its lawmaking function to the executive branch and independent agencies. To choose the former leaves major national problems unresolved. to opt for the latter risks unaccountable policymaking by those not elected to fill that role."" As members of the legislative branch. we all must take this seriously. We may be in the middle an election year. but if we play party politics when it comes to the struggle between the executive and the legislative power. neither party wins. and the American people lose. What is at stake. and more important than party politics. is the survival of our very form of government. a constitutional Republic. This is the time to come together. not as Republicans or Democrats. but as Americans. to bring this power back."
1140088904,I appreciate you bringing that up. because you bring up how many times it has been overstepped as of recent. but other administrations have done it in the past. But it sets a precedent from this point forward. If we dont rein it in now. when do you rein it in? Do you wait for the next candidate to come in? And we have had talks about that. If we dont do it now. it be would like buying fire insurance after your house catches on fire. It doesnt work. So it is so important that we come together as a body. Again. the Constitution is not a product of Republicans or Democrats or conservatives or liberals. The Constitution is not a function of government. Government is a function of the Constitution. When government steps over the boundaries of the Constitution. it is uswe. the peoplethe Representatives that were sent up here to hold and rein in the branches that are out of balance. This is all about bringing the three branches of government into balance. Let me just wind up with this. Mr. Speaker. once again. I would like to thank all the Members who have joined me this evening. Restoring Article I powers is so vital to the survival of our constitutional Republic. At this very moment. there are individuals seeking the highest office in the land who have stated. if Congress disagrees with them. they have no qualms about taking action on their own. circumventing Congress and disregarding the founding principles enshrined in our Constitution. That should give concern to everybody. The time has arrived for us to take action to restore this institution to the one the Founders envisioned. Granted. you can say what you want about our Founding Fathers. but they got this rightagain. as you and have I have talked about. with divine interventionand they put in place a way to amend it to make it better. not to get rid of it. It is time for us to stand up for this body. the peoples House. I will leave you with this reminder. All it takes for evil or tyranny to prevail or for our constitutional Republic to fail is for those good men and women to do nothing. I. Mr. Speaker. and the people that have joined us tonight. our colleagues that participated. will not sit idly by when the very document that has allowed so many people to be free. to achieve beyond their beliefs to a level never before ever achieved in human history. is being marginalized by inaction. I know my good friend from Iowa feels the same. And if you have any last remarks. you have got about 1 minute. if you want to wrap it up.
1140096253,Mr. Chair. my amendment is simply a commonsense measure to help reduce the size of outofcontrol Federal departments that continue to grow annually unchecked. increasing both scope. size. and increasing our spending. both discretionary and mandatory. Our Nation is over $19 trillion in debtlet me repeat that-$19 trillion in debt. This Chamber. us. we. the people. in government. or Members of the peoples House in charge of the taxpayers purse strings. must start taking action to actively reduce our expenditures. I appreciate the chairman and ranking member for their hard work on this bill. But I am concerned that the cost it will place on the American people is too great. We can do better and we must do better. This amendment is offered as a modest solution and establishes a 5 percent acrosstheboard cut to the Department of Energys total employees. In the private sector. when scrambling to cover your costs. you have to make decisions. including sometimes the elimination of positions that are not essential to the overall purpose and mission of the organization. or you simply cant afford it. Not only is reducing the current size of the Departments fulltime staff essential. but I think it also should be accompanied by a 1year hiring freeze. In 2013. when the government was shut downand I want to remind people that the government shut down over money. and it wasnt from an excess. it was from a lack of itthe Department of Energy was faced with this very dilemma and made a decision to furlough 69 percent of its workforce. These workers were deemed nonessential. I understand the circumstances were extraordinary. but the Department was still able to target areas within it that were not deemed essential to maintaining its most necessary functions. My amendment is only requiring the Department to reduce its fulltime employees by 5 percent. which in the scheme of things is nominal. but essential. in getting our country back on track fiscally. and it is the right thing to do. For our Nation to remain prosperous and to keep the American Dream alive for generations to come. we must make these decisions now. We must scale back Federal spending. One cannot have personal freedom without financial freedom. That same philosophy also applies to nations if they wish to pass on to their future generations the blessings of our past and our current posterity. liberties. and freedoms. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140098525,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to call attention to an incredibly important piece of legislation that will provide essential funding for programs which will go miles toward helping every young person in America who has maybe had a misstep reach their potential and achieve their American Dream. As I travel my district. I am so impressed as I meet some of the most incredible young people in north central Florida. These young Americans have the capability of literally changing the world and the capability of bettering their communities and setting a positive example for the youth that will follow in their footsteps. Unfortunately. too many will fall victim to the circumstances in which they were born. Too many will become familiar with the inside of a juvenile detention facility. as the image of the classroom fades from memory. and the alltoooften reality of life behind bars begins to materialize. I want to stress that if this happens to even just one child. that is one child too many. We live in the greatest nation on Earth. We tell our children they can be whatever they want to be when they grow up. yet we know the reality for some is that as these very words are spoken. there is no truth to them. These are the youth who fall subject to the cradletoprison pipeline. and it is unacceptable. These are the children in our communities. children who go to school with our own kids and. yes. in some cases even our own children. We have the ability to change their reality. H.R. 2197. the Youth PROMISE Act. will do just that. The Youth PROMISE Act establishes a PROMISE Advisory Panel of State representatives as well as local PROMISE Coordinating Councils. which will develop and implement evidencebased locally controllednot Washingtoncontrolledyouth violence prevention and intervention practices and mentorship opportunities. These practices will occur on a community level. working with families. working with schools. nonprofits. juvenile justice advocates. and law enforcement officers to intervene early in a childs life to prevent them from starting down a path that can easily define the remainder of their lives. Last Congress. the Youth PROMISE Act garnered the bipartisan support of over 130 Members of this body in Congress. yet it sat in committee for nearly 2 years. This Congress. the Youth PROMISE Act has sat in the House Committee on Education and the Workforce for over 400 days without action. Our youth cannot continue to wait. There are many issues that Congress deals with which Republicans. Democrats. and Independents cannot agree upon. but this is not one of them. If they have not already. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this vital piece of legislation. I urge leadership in the House and the Senate to bring up this bill for a vote. a vote for our challenged youth so that they may continue the great posterity of this Nation.

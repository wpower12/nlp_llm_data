1130009003,"Madam President. I assume a number of my colleagues have seen the movie ""Lincoln."" One particularly brief but poignant moment of that movie showed the Presidents staff discouraging him from spending so much time talking to regular people. leaving the White House and inviting normal people who werent involved in politics every day or didnt work in the White House into the White House to talk. They were saying: Mr. President. you need to run this war. You have so much to do. You shouldnt be meeting with people as much. President Lincoln said to his staff: I need my regular public opinion baths. Just listening to the last few speakers. particularly the Republican leader. I think it is more important more people in this institution go out and talk to real people who are affected by this health care law. There is the 25yearold who has already benefited from staying on her mothers health care plan. the person in the highrisk pool who has insurance nowsuch as a friend of mine in Port Clinton in Ottawa County. Ohio. doesbecause of this law. People have seen the consumer protections. They havent lost their insurance because they were expensive for an insurance company. My colleagues need to get a public opinion bath. walk around their States a little more and listen to people outside of the country clubs and outside of the trade associations who are charged ideologically and not really particularly open about these kinds of issues. I rise to oppose the amendment offered by Senator CRuz. the badly named ""Restore Growth First"" amendment. which would prohibit resources included in the continuing resolution to implement the Affordable Care Act. Specious claims about how the health law will harm our economy have already been debunked by the hundreds of Ohioans who are able to have annual wellness visits. by the tens of thousands of young adults staying on their parents insurance plans. by the seniors who are seeing the doughnut hole coverage gap closing with real savings on prescription costs. It has been debunked by Americans who are no longer denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. by the Americans who are not forced to pay more for insurance because of a preexisting condition. by women who may now rely on affordable. accessible reproductive health services. and starting in 2014. Americans who have not been able to afford health insurance in the private market will be able to comparison shop. if needed. to purchase insurance. These much needed health care reforms which will benefit Americans next year are already benefiting Americans and have been for a couple of years. Continued implementation of these reforms is crucial for improving the quality of care and bending the cost curve. I agree with Senator CRUZ on one thing: health spending is related to the economy and to the deficit. Lets be clear. We know the health care law will reduce the deficit by over $100 billion over the next decade. These are Congressional Budget Office numbers. not Republican numbers or Democratic numbers. On the Cruz amendment. repealing the health care law would increase. not reduce. the deficit. We know how it is helping people. There are 100.000 reasons in my own State of Ohio to stand up for this health care law and reject this amendment: Nearly 97.000 of Ohios young adults are now able to stay on their parents plan until age 26."
1130017691,"Mr. President. this week Senator DURBIN and I are introducing the Working Families Tax Relief Act with a majority of my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee. For a number of years. one area of bipartisan agreement in Washington has been on the need for comprehensive tax reform. Tax reform can clear the Code of wasteful carveouts and special interest loopholes. Senator ENZI was part of a bipartisan meeting that the Finance Committee is wont to do. sitting around a table talking about these issues. just last week. We understand that comprehensive tax reform can place American companies on an even footing with foreign competitors. It can reduce the deficit. It can provide a shot in the arm to economic competitiveness and growth. On that there is agreement. What comprehensive reform should not doand there is general agreement on this alsois undermine the earnedincome tax credit and the child tax credit. These credits are the single most effective incentive to increase lowincome parents participating in the workforce and reward work and promote family formationall goals which we. I believe. all seek. That is why support for these programs in the past has been broadbased and bipartisan. President Reagan and former Representative Jack Kempthe former running mate of Senator Dole in a Presidential electionwere champions of the modern earnedincome tax credit. When it was expanded in 1986. President Reagan said it is ""the best antipoverty. the best profamily. the best job creation measure to come out of Congress."" He was right. In Ohio some 1 million households received the EITCthe earnedincome tax creditand 665.000 households received the CTCthe child tax crediton average in the 3 years of 2009. 2010. and 2011. That is why this week Senator DURBIN and I. along with most of our Democratic colleagues. are introducing the Working Families Tax Relief Act. Our bill would make permanent the 2009 levels for the earnedincome tax credit and the child tax credit. It would index the child tax credit for inflation. It would allow workers without children to access the full earnedincome tax credit. It would reduce the full earnedincome tax credit access age to 21. It would simplify the filing process to reduce fraud because there is some acknowledged fraud in this program. as there is throughout the tax system. And I have pledged to many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. as this bill moves forward. to work to reduce that fraud. The Recovery Act of 4 years ago expanded access and refundability for both the EITC and CTC. It was meant to respond to the great recession but also to ensure the countrys finest antipoverty programs keep up with the times. Making these credits permanent at the current level is critical to fighting poverty. In 2011. the EITC and CTC lifted 10 million people. including 5 million children. out of poverty. The EITC has helped nearly half a million single mothers enter the workforce. These credits do not just reward work. they provide lifelong benefits to children. We know from studies that it improves health outcomes. it increases earning potential for children in lowincome families. because those families pulled out of poverty can give advantages to those children that pay off later in life they could not give to those children in those families if their incomes were below the poverty line. Expectant mothers who receive the EITC are more likely to receive prenatal care. These are not opinions. they are fact. Newborns are more likely to experience birth indicators. such as low weight and premature birth. Behind all of these statistics are real people. people whose lives and opportunities are improved because of these credits. Let me share a story. Michelle Eddy. a Cleveland native. is a single mother who works hard to support her two daughters. One is 9. the younger is 4. This year the Neighborhood Housing Services of Greater Cleveland helped Ms. Eddy prepare her tax return. She was able to use the credits she received from Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit to pay for school supplies. uniforms. and daycare for her two daughters. She has worked in a retail store as a shift manager for 5 years. She recently. though. started a new job as a restaurant server so she can spend evenings and weekends with her daughters. Without EITC. without CTC. she would almost certainly have to work a second job to make ends meet. leaving her children at home without her far too often. The EITC and the CTC are not what make Michele Eddy a good mother. but they enable her to be there with her children when they need her most. Right now. some 30 percent of children under the age of 3 are in families with too little earnings to qualify for full CTC. Even worse. nearly 13 percent of children under 3 are in families with no earnings. and as such get into CTC or EITC. We know the Child Tax Credit is not indexed for inflation. By the end of the decade another 1 million children will be forced to grow up in poverty. The CTC needs to be more robust. We need to reform the Tax Code now. I am very hopeful that Senator BAUCUS in his last year and a half in the Senate. with Ranking Member HATCH and leaders from that committee such as Senator WYDEN and Senator ENZI and others. can reform the Tax Code. can put measures in place to prevent fraud. As we introduce the Working Families Tax Relief Act. I remain hopeful our colleagues across the aisle will work with us to make these credits a part of tax reform. I yield the floor."
1130019006,Mr. President. on April 22. 1970after years of planningEarth Day activities stretched from college campuses. to city parks. to community halls across the country. The landscape has changed since students. activists. and environmentalists celebrated the first Earth Day. That citizen call to action spurred a new season of environmental protections that have improved the health of our Nations air. lands. rivers. and the Great Lakes. Just several decades ago. polluted air and water threatened the public health and safety of our Nation. The Cuyahoga River in Cleveland had caught on fire and oil spills marred the beaches of Santa Barbara. These catastrophic events served as catalysts that established the Environmental Protection Agency. EPA. passed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. and formed a public and political consciousness of the need to safeguard our environment. Today. the Cuyahoga River44 years after the fireis cleaner and healthier. more than 60 different fish species are thriving. and countless families are again enjoying its natural beauty. Today. Earth Day is celebrated around the world. Now communities across Ohio and the Nation are spurring on the next generation of environmental innovation. Seeds planted in places such as Oregon. OHa city just east of Toledo in northwest Ohioare beginning to grow. To reduce energy costs. the Oregon City School District partnered with the ToledoLucas County Port Authority to transition away from traditional electricity to wind and solar power. Oregon City Schools set up wind turbines at Clay High School and Eisenhower Middle School. They installed solar panels on the roofs of Jerusalem and Starr Elementary Schools. And these innovative investments have paid off. In just 10 days in October. Clay Campuss wind turbine. Power Wind 56. produced 149 percent of campus energy needs. All computers. all lights. all kitchen activity. and fans on Clay Campus are now windpowered. This includes the administration building. bus garage. and maintenance building at the stadium. Besides saving on energy costs. as of March 21. the school district is producing 800 fewer tons of carbon dioxide. This means less acid raincausing sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide going into the air. This innovation and activism marks tremendous progress toward a more sustainable environment. If we fail to protect our natural resources. we risk the health of citizens. the viability of our coastal areas. and the productivity of our States farms. forests. and fisheries. We risk our longterm economic and national security. Yet we know that choosing between economic growth and environmental protections is a false choice. Despite our population growing by 50 percent in the past 40 years and the number of cars on the road having doubled over that same time. our air is now 60 percent cleaner than at the time of the first Earth Day in 1970. Done right. our Nation can become energy independent. improve its global competitiveness. and create new jobs and technologies for our workforce. As we plant the seeds for economic growthfor new jobs in new industrieswe are also planting the seeds for a cleaner. more sustainable environment. The students and parents of the Oregon City School District are a reminder that taking steps to protect our air and water is something that we do every day. not just on April 22. Earth Day reminds us of our ability and our history of innovation and perseverance to protect our environment for current and future generations.*
1130031683,Mr. President. I rise to speak about amendment No. 1311. the Hire Americans First amendment. which I hope to call up later. Nearly 8 percent of Americans are unemployed or underemployed and our immigration policy obviously must be a jobs policy. Any successful immigration plan must take a closer look at the HlB Program. which serves an important but specific and limited purpose. The HlB visa was created so businessesparticularly in high tech but not exclusively thatso businesses could recruit foreign workers to help fill the void created a by a lack of American workers with those specific skills. Yet. as this bill comes to the floor. something very important was excluded. The bill lacks a requirementwhich was in earlier versions of the billthat employers hire an equally or better qualified American worker when one is available. rather than a potential HlB worker. The bill lacks a requirement that employers hire a qualified. equally or better qualified American worker when one is available. rather than a potential HlB foreign worker. With this bill we are enshrining a processwithout this amendmentthat allows companies to pass over skilled Americans for foreign workers after they have been required to actually actively recruit those Americans. The bill has provisions to recruit Americans for these jobs that might have gone to an HlB foreign worker. but it falls short. It doesnt require the employer to actuallyafter going through that process. to actually hire the American worker who is as qualified or better qualified than the HlB foreign worker. This approach only undermines support for the HlB Program because it will be seen as a tool to avoid hiring American workers. Understand the American public. as they start to kind of understand and digest the provisions of this purported new law. this legislation. when they hear that. yes. companies have to recruit and look for American workers but in the end. even if the American worker is as qualified or more qualified. the company is under no obligation to actually hire the American. Senator GRASSLEY has been a champion in the fight to end HlB abuse. That is why I am proud to join Senator GRASSLEY in our bipartisan amendment to introduce the HlB and L1 Visa Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 2013. The HlB program should only be used when there is no qualified worker available in the United States. That is clearly what the American people overwhelmingly say they want: that the program should only be used when there is no qualified worker available here. This amendment would increase protections to workers by requiring that employers only hire HlB workers. as I said before. when there is no equally qualified or better qualified American. This amendment would make sure a worker from Wuhan would not be hired at the expense of a qualified engineer or scientist from Elyria or Sylvania. OH. It means ensuring that American companies seek out. find. and hire skilled American workers before seeking visas for foreign workers. However. that is not included in this version of the bill that we are debating on the Senate floorthe immigration bill. The bill in its current form simply says that companies have to look for qualified Americans. It doesnt require them to actually hire the equally qualified or better qualified American. such as a chemist from Cleveland or a computer scientist from Celina. The underlying bill increases the number of HlBeligible visas. and that is fine. But it also cracks down on employers who take advantage of the system. Without the requirement to also hire qualified U.S. workers. the recruitment steps mean standing on an escalator that leads to nowhere. What this legislation now says is that companies that consider HlB visa hires need to recruit Americans. but the bill falls short of saying if the American is as qualified or more qualified they need to hire that American. If they are qualified Americans who can do the work. there is simply no need to fill the post with an HlB worker. Passing the BrownGrassley amendmentalso cosponsored by Senator SESSIONS. a Republican from Alabama. and Senator MANCHIN. a Democrat from West Virginiathe hire Americans first amendment is important in fixing that. I yield the floor.
1130047153,"I thank the senior Senator from Minnesota for her words and especially work on this bill and the consumer issues. She has made a real name in this body for her work. I rise today to discuss the most significant reform of our Nations health policy in decades. The Affordable Care Act is a result of extensive policy discussions. latenight deliberations. 400 amendments that we considered in the Health. Education. Labor. and Pension Committee. more than 100 of those amendments that we adopted coming from Republican ideas and Republican Senators. There is a reason that people across the country. mothers and fathers and students and faith leaders and business owners and workers. are paying attention. It is because the law benefits all Americans. a wide range of Americans and especially in my home State. which I will discuss. More than 900.000 people in Ohio will be eligible for financial assistance to buy insurance that provides good coverage at a price they can afford. Ohioans suffering from preexisting conditions will no longer be denied coverage or charged higher premiums. Young Ohioans stay on their parents plan until the age of 26. giving them a chance to finish school and secure a job that provides coverage. Those with the greatest need will get the greatest help. For years we have heard countless stories. story after story of Americans frustrated by and failed by our health system. Last fall my wife Connie was waiting in line at the local drugstore in an affluent community outside of Cleveland. The woman in front of her was. for all intents and purposes. negotiating price with the pharmacist to save money. ""What if I cut my pill in half and then take it twice a day."" she asked. The very understanding pharmacist wanted her to take her full medication twice a day. ""But isnt it better. since I cant afford this. to take half a pill twice a day than the whole pill just once."" she asked. After the woman left my wife asked how often does this happen? The pharmacist answered. ""Every day. every day all day."" The tide is turning. I hear from constituents at roundtables. in restaurants. in letters and tweets and emails about their concerns for their familys health. A woman in Cuyahoga Falls. a community near Akron. explained to me she recently graduated law school. She is a type 1 diabetic. Without the health care law she would have been paying out of pocket for extremely costly lifesaving medication because she could not afford it on her own. I can imagine. she said. there are many Ohioans like me. working hard for my future but finding myself in a tough demanding spot while still needing to care for my health needs. Health care enrollment marks a milestone for millions of Ohioans. including myself. Twenty years ago I was running for Congress and made a promise in 1992 that I would not accept congressional health care. I would pay my own health insurance. until similar coverage was available to all Americans. I did that for well over a decade. I can now say I will be enrolling in the health care marketplace. alongside hundreds of thousands of people from Ohio. While millions will be able to enroll in benefits beginning in less than 2 weeks. the health care law has already provided measurable benefits. I wish to share how Ohioans are already helped by provisions in this law signed by the President 3 years ago. There are 97.000 young adults who are now able to stay on their parents health insurance until their 26th birthday. We are closing the doughnut hole. The Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned what that means for his State. There are similar numbers in Ohio. Closing the doughnut hole for seniors prescription drugs saves Ohioans an average of $774 a year on medication benefits. There are 6.300 Ohioans who receive rebates from their insurance companies because those companies failed to follow the new Federal law that required them to spend at least 80 to 85 percentdepending on the kind of insuranceof their premium dollars on health care. In other words. if these companies spend more than 15 percent of your dollar that you pay to these insurance companies on marketing. executive salaries. and various kinds of administrative expenses. they owe you money back because not a high enough percent85 percentof your health care dollar was spent on health care itself. There are 900.000 Ohioans who have received free preventive care. with no copays and no deductibles. Seniors have been tested for osteoporosis. diabetes. and all the other kinds of screenings that seniors should get. Children are no longer denied coverage for preexisting conditions. My wife was diagnosed with asthma at a young ageway before I knew her. She might have been denied coverage today. She. and young people like her at that stage in their life. cannot be denied coverage for preexisting conditions such as asthma. diabetes. cancer or whatever they might have. Soon all Ohioans will have access to quality. affordable health care. In 2014. we will see all aspects of this health care law fully implemented. which will make a huge difference for businessespecially small businessesfamilies. and communities. From Ashtabula to Athens. from Bryan to Bellaire. from Mansfield to Middletown. middleclass families across Ohio have been in the horrible position of paying monthly premiums only to find they were stripped of coverage or that the coverage was so minimal as to be useless when they became sick. That worry will no longer exist. For students at Ohio State or Wooster. Youngstown State or Xavier. the choice between paying for another semester at school or health insurance will not be the concern it has been for so many years. For Ohioans from Cleveland to Cincinnati already covered. they can keep their current plan without lifting a finger. The only change they will see are new benefits. better protections. and more bang for their buck. For millions in my State. the new law will mean less worry. less anxiety. and more money in their wallets. For some Americans. the health insurance marketplace will lower premiums at least 10 percent more than previously expected. Work needs to be done. The system is not perfect. but this law is already bringing our health care into the future. It is a forwardlooking law. I have been proud to support it. On October 1. frustrations. worry. and failed health care protections will soon become a thing of the past for millions in my State and tens of millions around the country. I yield the floor."
1130054674,"Mr. President. I am privileged to represent the State of Ohio. as I know the Presiding Officer is to represent Connecticut. and the previous speaker is to represent Nebraska. We are home to several large research facilitiesmedical research facilities. aeronautics research facilities. military research facilities. some that are overwhelmingly represented to do research in pure science. All of them have a major impact in their communities in terms of employment with usually very goodpaying jobsscientists. engineers. physicians. chemists. and all kinds of people in the natural. medical. or aeronautic sciences and all of the support staff. These research facilities are always good for communities. And they not only provide employment. but they provide great wealth for our country. So much of this research helps people in their daily lives and is commercialized into businesses. and entrepreneurs take much of this research and applied science and create more economic activity. prosperity. and goodpaying jobs. And that is where this shutdown is particularly problematic. There are 800.000 Federal employees that have lost jobs as a result of this ridiculous shutdown. I have spent much of the last several days on the phone talking to people running these institutions. talking to smalltown and bigcity bankers. entrepreneurs. businesses. union officials. and people who represent or run many of these organizations. All of them think this shutdown is absolutely unnecessary. Just a moment ago the Presiding Officer and I had a conversation. and we both shake our heads: Why do radicals in the House of Representatives want to inflict this kind of painnot just on the 800.000 Federal workers. but on the contractors near these facilities. the restaurants. hardware stores and businesses. and the school districts that are affected because people arent bringing home the income and arent paying as much taxesall that happens when this willful government shutdown. orchestrated because a group of people want to attach their political platform. ideas. gimmicks. or statements to legislation we need to pass? It is pretty simple: Pass the continuing resolution. Keep the government open. That is not a Democratic or Republican platform. That is what we need to do. Dont go around attaching political statements in a political platform to a simple ""keep the government open"" resolution. The same on the debt ceiling. Nobody is wild about increasing the debt ceiling. Nobody is wild about passing legislation so we dont default. It is not a part of the 2012 Democratic platform to raise the debt ceiling. nor is it a part of the 2012 Republican platform. So when we have a vote. it is not negotiated: Lets add a bunch of 2012 Republican party platform rhetoric to something to raise the debt ceiling so the government of the United States pays its bills. It is not a Democratic or a Republican value to pay the bills this Congress ran up. It is our duty. We take an oath of office. I took the oath in January 2013. The Presiding Officer took his oath. We know running the government and paying our bills is what you do as an elected official. Those never used to be controversial. until some radicals in the House of Representatives decided that this is a political opportunity. We can accuse the President of not negotiating. We can tell the public the Democrats are willing to shut down the government. The Republican Governor of Nevada to the Democratic majority leader from Nevada this week called it a Republican shutdown. So it is clearly a group of radicals. Back to what I was saying about these great research facilities. The Presiding Officer has them in Connecticut. I have them in Ohio. and the Senator from Hawaii has them in her State. An administrator of one said it is asymmetrical. killing and building a major scientific endeavor. It is a lot harder and takes a lot longer for a group of engineers. doctors or scientists to construct a very important scientific endeavor than it does to kill one. Fifty years ago. Speaker of the House Rayburn from Texas at one time saidand I will clean this up: Any mule can kick down a barn. It takes a carpenter to build one. I will make it more personal. A dozen years ago I was involved in a car accident and broke my back. I was in good health and exercised. but for 3 days I didnt get out of bed. I remember the first day I got out of bed and tried to walk. My leg muscles had atrophied. It takes a lot of time to build up those leg muscles. and it took 3 days for them to atrophy. I was in my late 40s then and in good shape. That is also the way science is. in the same sense that it takes a long time and a lot of investment of public dollars and a lot of brain power and really highquality. talented scientists. engineers. doctors. or medical researchers to do these projects. And then we are going to lay them off for 2 or 3 weeks because somebody has some political idea they want to attach to a continuing resolution. Somebody wants to take their political platform and put it on legislation that the government pay its bills for their political gain. A leader of one of these major institutions in Ohio told me he had to bring in many of his managers and employees and tell them there were going to be layoffs and furloughs. In some cases. with no end in sight because of this government shutdown. what are they going to do? Their scientific endeavors get interrupted and in some cases may not be repaired or rebuilt. So many of the best scientists and engineers are going to say: I am not coming back and doing this. So the radical Republicans in the House of Representatives say: OK. we can keep the government open if you repeal part of ObamaCare. If the President had done that and said: OK. keep the government open. and we will repeal this section of ObamaCare. what would have happened next? Then there would have been another continuing resolution or another end of the fiscal year or another opportunity these politicians would have seized to again threaten to shut the government down and gut something else. some other law they dont like. In other words. if there is a law they dont like. and they are in the position. then they are going to say: I am going to shut the government down if you dont change this law. If the President says yes to that. what happens the next time? Then. I am going to ask the President to get rid of two laws I dont like or I will shut the government down or I am going to block the government from paying its bills because I dont like a law passed back in 1993 or 2007. We cant operate the government like that. NASA Glenn Research facilities. one of the great NASA facilities in the country. WrightPatterson Air Force Base. a major research facility near Dayton. OH. Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbusthousands of employees. engineers. scientists. technicians. highlyskilled people. very educated. run eight of the national energy labs. Case Western Reserve University Medical School and Engineering School. Ohio State University. University of CincinnatiI could name one after another. These places cant operate if every 6 months or 1 year they are subject to a potential government shutdown unless the President does what some radical Members of Congress want. So when people say: First. open the government. second. pay our bills. and. third. lets negotiatewe have already negotiated the dollar figure on the continuing resolution. Every time the continuing resolution expires or the fiscal year ends. every time we have to pay our debts when the debt ceiling limit is reachedif we have to play this game. it is going to mean a potential government shutdown or disruption at Battelle. NASA Glenn. Ohio States medical school funding and research funding. and WrightPatterson Air Force Base. If that is the way this crowd believes we should run a government. they dont have much regard for government. Every time they have had a chance. they tried to privatize Medicare. they tried to privatize Social Security. They dont like EPA. Head Start. or Meals On Wheels. They dont like these government programs. I understand that. but play it right. Dont threaten to close the government unless we change the law which Congress passed. the President signed. and the Supreme Court affirmed. But if it was my political platform in 2012even though it was defeated in front of tens of millions of votersand I dont like what you are doing. then I am going to threaten to shut down the government. Our country is too important and too big for that. On an international scale. the President of the United States didnt go to China for a major economic conference because he had to be here because the government was shut down. Other countriesparticularly Chinamade fun of us. Other countries basically were asking: Is the United States abdicating its leadership role? And the Peoples Republic of China is not slowing down in their investment in scientific research or modernizing their infrastructure. If we allow this kind of government shutdown and this kind of activity by radicals in the House of Representatives. this is not good for our country. Mr. President. I yield the floor."
1130068241,"Mr. President. President Johnson 50 years ago. as Senator HARKIN was talking about. declared a war on poverty down the hall in the House of Representatives in his State of the Union Message. A little later he visited Athens. OH. in the heart of Appalachia. and he said: I came out here today to see you because we cant always see poverty from the Capital in Washington. But you can see it when you get out and ride the rivers and the range. the mountains and the hills. When President Lincoln was in office. even though his staff said stay in the office. win the war. free the slaves. preserve the Union. President Lincoln would say. no. I need to get out and take my ""public opinion baths""-I need to see the people and talk to them and understand their problems. Pope Francis recently exhorted his parish priests to go smell like the flock. obviously using the allegory of the sheep in the Old Testament and New Testament. but also saying to his parish priests: Understand how people live. talk to them about their issues and their problems and their lives and live among them as much as you can. something perhaps none of us in this bodyI know the Presiding Officer from Vermont possibly does more townhalls and meetings with people than anybody in the Senate. All of us need to do that more to understand better. But as we debate the extension of unemployment benefits. $500 a week is the average benefit. 52.00 people in my State were cut off from benefits at the end of the year. tens of thousands more will lose their benefits if we dont act. It is not just what this means to parents so they can feed their families and continue to look for work. But as the Presiding Officer knows. they need to continue to look for work in order to get this $300 a week on average. We also know it helps the economy. One hundred years ago this week. Henry Ford made an announcement that stunned the country. He said: Everybody in my auto plant is going to receive $5 a day. Whether it was the young man sweeping the floor or the autoworker. they were all going to receive $5 a day. Whether it was done out of generosity or not. what Henry Ford knew was putting money in workers pocketsjust the same as when you put money in peoples pockets for unemployment benefits. which is the insurance they paid intothe money that they get will help grow the economy. It will help people be able to do things they would not otherwise be able to do. That is the importance of the extension of unemployment benefits. and that is the importance of passing minimum wage legislation. which Senator HARKIN also spoke about. The fair minimum wage would raise the minimum wage 90 cents upon the signature of the President. 90 cents a year later. and 90 cents a year after that. At the same time it would raise the subminimum wage for those people who work in diners. push wheelchairs in airports. and for valets in restaurants. Those workers often make less than the minimum wage. The subminimum wagethe tipped wageis only $2.13 an hour. It hasnt been raised since 1991. The Harkin. Sanders. Brownand others who are part of this legislation on the minimum wage billlegislation will increase the tipped minimum wage over time up to 70 percent of the real minimum wage. I will close with a letter from Karen in Columbus. She said: I had to come out of medical retirement because I couldnt make ends meet. I have now worked at a department store for four years and still dont make $9.00 an hour. My salary goes entirely towards rent and utilities. My water bill just went up $8.00 For those of us in this Chamber. if the water bill goes up $8. you deal with it. It is not that big of a deal. She is not even making $9 an hour. The increase in her water bill is 1 hour of pay at this department store. My water bill just went up $8.00as it goes up every year just like the electric. food. and gas. Heaven forbid my car would break down or I would fall victim to a serious illness. I hope that our colleagues are getting their public opinion baths. I hope our colleagues are out among people listening to these stories. I close. again with a quote from President Johnsons speech in Athens. OH. which was 50 years ago this year. Poverty hides its face behind a mask of affluence. But I call upon you to help me get out there and unmask it. take that mask off of that face of affluence and let the world see what we have. and let the world do something about it. We have an opportunity today to do something about unemployment insurance and help people get back on their feet. We have an opportunity in the months ahead to raise the minimum wage. To restore it to something close to what it was back in 1968 in real buying power. that should be our obligation. our duty. and our mission in the months ahead."
1130096965,Mr. President. there is good news for Americas veterans this afternoon. Senator MCCAIN and Senator SANDERS. the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee. have apparently come to a tentative agreement on what we should do to deal with some of the serious problems at the Veterans Administration. We know a couple of things. First of all. we know that health care in the veterans hospitals. in the VA system. in the communitybased clinics in places such as Akron and Canton and Youngstown and Springfield and Mansfield and the care in the big hospitals. such as Wade Park and Dayton. is superb and there is overwhelming support among veterans for the care they have earned and deserve and are getting. The problem is getting access to that care in a number of cases. Too many veterans have waited too long. been forced to wait too long to get the medical care and the medical treatment they need. That is a product. frankly. of a historically underfunded VA. We know a decade ago. when the President a decade agomore than a decade agoand the Senate and the House took the country to war the Veterans Administration funding was put pretty flat. There was no real preparation by the Congress. by the Presidentthen President Bushand by the VA to scale up veterans capacity. the VA capacity. veterans health carenot enough nurses. not enough doctors. not enough health care personnel. not enough capacity at the VA health care system to take care of the surging numbers of soldiers coming home. sailors coming home. marines coming home. air men and women coming home. We also know at the same time what happened with Agent Orange. and the Agent Orange presumptive eligibility. As Vietnam veterans were beginning to get sicker. were beginning to show more and more symptoms. the government made the right decision. Congress made the right decision. if a soldier had boots on the ground. they were eligible. If a soldier had an illness defined by the law that was connected to Agent Orange. then they were presumed to be eligible. They didnt have to go back and prove they were actually exposed at a certain place at a certain time in Vietnam. All of those were good things. as our country. our government. our VA. embraced war. men and women. to get the VA care they earned. The bad news was Congress and the President didnt prepare for it a decade ago as this surge of new people. the veterans coming home. veterans living here for a number of years after doing their service. that they could get the health care they needed. That is the reason we have had these long delays. There are certainly issues of leadership within the VA. There are issues of administrators not doing their jobs. They should be held accountable. They should pay a price for thatsometimes termination. certainly disciplinary action if shown to have failed to live up to their responsibilities ethically and efficiently and correctly and responsibly. It is clear this new agreement will take us forward. It will mean a couple of things. One. it means those administrators. those VA officials who didnt do their jobs. will be held accountable. Secondly. and most importantly. it will mean veterans who have had long delays or who live in rural areas and simply cant get the coverage. cant get to the VA clinic. the communitybased outpatient clinic or the VA hospital. the VA center. if they cant get that health care treatment today. or soon. they can go to a private hospital. they can go to a communitybased health clinic and get the coverage. get the care they need at no cost to the veteran. The third thing is. to make up for the neglect of a decade ago that we have tried to remedy by almost doubling the VA budget over the last 5 years to take care of all these people who are now in the system who have suffered much more serious illness and disability than the veterans of a generation ago who might have died on the battlefield from these same injuries. that we scale up the training of doctors and nurses in these VA facilities. There has been an agreement reached among a group of us on the veterans committee and both parties that we will fund a number of new facilities around the country as we train more doctors and nurses and other health care personnelphysical therapists. occupational therapists. and others. At a time of not particularly good news for veterans over the last few weeks and really over the last few months. this is good news. This will make for a better VA. We know the VA is a huge health care system. with 85 million veteran visits. patient visits to the VA over the last year and 8 million different veterans have used the VA over the last 12 months. We have to make sure we do our jobs as Senators and Members of Congress and in the White House to take care of our veterans. For those who served us. it is time we served our veterans. Mr. President. I yield the floor.
1130105057,"Mr. President. I have received a number of calls in recent weeks. as we all have. about what is happening at the Veterans Administration. Over the July 4th week. back in Ohio. I heard from lots of veterans at roundtables in communities all over the State. from Steubenville to Dayton. and lots of places in between: What are we going to do about the VA? I heard outrage. I heard disillusion over the VA. There is outrage about a system charged with caring for those who defend our Nation that falls short. There is frustration and disillusion because our veterans are waiting too long. We need to fix that. But I also saw letters to the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Cleveland Plain Dealer and I had conversations with veterans who defended and bragged about the service they are getting. the care they are getting. whether it is the VA in Cincinnati or Dayton or Cleveland or Columbus or Chillicothethe hospitals we have in my Stateor whether it is the communitybased clinics in places such as Mansfield and Zanesville and Lima and Springfieldthose smaller communitybased outpatient clinics. socalled CBOCs. that serve veterans who need less acute care but still need service from a doctor. from a nurse. from a physical therapist. We can only conclude a couple of things. We can conclude there are. in fact. serious problems with the VA that need to be fixed. The Presiding Officer is a prominent member of the Veterans Committee. and from his veterans hospitals in Connecticut he hears the same. We can also conclude that those who get in the system overwhelmingly are getting good care. There are 6.5 million veterans who are using VA health care with 85 million patient visits a year. That was in 2013. I assume there is a similar number this year. They are getting good care. The problem is access to the system. The waiting times are simply unacceptable and outrageous and the disillusionment for those veterans is worse. We know what waiting times mean. especially in mental health treatment. where far too many veterans commit suicide. With costs of warand particularly this last round of wars over the last decade where we went to war as a nation. wrongly. in Iraqwe didnt pay for that warand then the President and the Congress a decade ago made a fateful mistake. mostly out of arrogance. assuming that these two wars would be so short we didnt need to scale up the VA. we didnt need to increase funding. we didnt need to expand services. we didnt need to hire more doctors and nursestwo things happened. One. a whole bunch of new veterans. new soldiers and sailors and marines and air men and women. came home from Iraq and Afghanistan. A whole lot more were in the war than President Bush and the Congress thought would happen or cared to think would happen a decade ago. The second thing is they came home in much worse shape than in previous wars. Soldiers who would have died on the battlefieldsthe Presiding Officer is a veteran himself and he knows and we all know that the illnesses and physical and mental injuries are much greater in this war because they survived the battlefield when they might not have survived these same kinds of explosions 20 or 30 years ago. The third thingI said two. The third thing that happened is because of a decision Congress made that was right a couple of decades agoI believe it was President Clinton who signed that bill. it might have been President Bush 1in passing a bill which included a provision called presumptive eligibility for Agent Orange. Before presumptive eligibility. when a veteran came home from Vietnam right after the war or developed an illness many years later. that veteran would have to fight with the VA to prove that Agent Orange was the reason he or she had that illness. After Agent Orange presumptive eligibility. what that meant is that these soldiers and these veterans. 20 years later. if they had 1 of the 20 or so illnesses defined by the law that were connected to Agent Orange. they automatically were eligible. That is called presumptive eligibility. meaning they were eligible for VA services and health care. That was a great thing. However. what that meant is that as more and more veterans moved forward from Vietnam. as they aged into their fifties and sixties and some into their seventies. they have had a huge influx of patients into the VA. That is why this veterans conference reportthe bill that passed the House and the bill that passed the Senate with almost no ""no"" votesis so important. because our commitment to our veterans must match their commitment to our Nation. I am the first Ohioan to serve a full term ever on the Senate Veterans Committee. I have been lucky enough to be appointed to the joint House and Senate conference committee. We need to iron out the differences in these bills. We need to do three things. First. increase the accountability in the VA. VA employees. senior employees in particular. who dont do their jobs should lose their jobs. that if it is proven in fact they did not do their jobs. if they altered information. if they explained away delays incorrectly or dishonestly. that they be held accountable. period. Although lets keep in mind the vast majority of VA employees. whether they are in Hartford or whether they are in Cleveland. are dedicated public servants to our Nation and to our veterans. These are men and women who chose to serve veterans. to work in Chillicothe. in Zanesville. and in Columbus. and so many of them are veterans themselves. They chose a career to serve veterans and they are veterans themselves. Whether it is a police officer at the Dayton VA. a claims processor at the Cleveland VARO. a nurse at the Toledo CBOC. our veterans rely on them. We shouldnt condemn the VA at large for the wrongdoings of a relative few. Second. the compromise bill will provide an option for veterans who are experiencing long wait times. In the Presiding Officers State of Connecticut and in mine. few veterans are all that far from a CBOC or from a hospital. and this new proposal says that for veterans more than 40 miles away from a CBOC or hospital. they can go elsewhere to a local hospital or a local communitybased health center instead of the VA because they are closer. We dont have too many places in my Stateand I believe there are none in the Presiding Officers Statewhere that is the case. But those veterans who have had to wait 30 years or 30 days should have that option because care for the veteran. our commitment to veterans must match their commitment to our Nation. Third and last. the compromise bill will expand and enhance the VAs ability to provide veterans with the care they deserve. It will allow the VA to hire more doctors and nurses and physical therapists. to build more beds. to build more capacity at these VA centers and CBOCs to make sure they have the staff necessary. With the end of these two wars. thousands of our newest veterans will be joining the ranks of VA health care. The shortage of care providers has been especially pressing for vets struggling with a brain injurythe socalled invisible injuries. That is when a soldier in the Army gets a head injury and it might be considered a minor head injury. A number of combatants have told me they get their ""bells rung"" is the term they use. It is an invisible injury. a minor concussionoften not reported but a minor concussionand then another one and then another one. Look at what the stories have told us about the NFL players. The same holds true. only in a more serious way. for soldiers and for marines. what happens to them down the road. Thirty years later they go to the VA. their behavior has changed. their families are calling. The VA has no documentation of these injuries. They have to struggle to show these injuries. to prove these injuries to the VA. to the doctors for a diagnosis and to the VA for the coverage of the disability. That is why my tracker bill. the Fairman Significant Event Tracker Actor SET Actis so important. Instead of the burden being on the veteran to show here were my concussions. here were my injuries. I should be eligible for disability. here is what happened to me. diagnose me with the right diagnosis. the Army itself should be keeping those records. and they should follow the health care of the veteran when they are in the military. when they are in the VA. The interface has to take place much more smoothly. so when a soldier turns in her gear and she comes back to Ravenna. OH. or she comes back to Wauseon. OH. or she comes back to Maple Heights or Garfield Heights. the VA locally will know what has happened to her. These are the challenges. I will finish with a couple of troubling notes I received from a couple of people in Ohio. One came from Gary in Franklin County. which is the home of the State capital: My brother was a Vietnam vet and survivor of a major battle in Vietnam. He never discussed his experiences. He took his life in 1992. This bill will provide important mechanisms to help reduce the rate of suicides among our veterans. Every Member of Congress should support it. It is not a political issue. but a part of our sincere and legitimate commitment to our veterans. I couldnt have said it better. Christine from Miami County. the county just north of Dayton in southwest Ohio: This bill will remove the redtape that our veterans encounter at a time when they are least able to deal with it. My son died at his own hands after a tour in the Middle East. He sought help from the VA and was diagnosed with PTSD shortly before dying. I know his mental state at the time. and he would not have been able to handle providing proof that he experienced traumatic events or remember the duties he performed. In other words. he had these injuries. The military didnt have the records of these injuries because he wasnt injured so badly that he was sent back to Germany or to Bethesda or to Walter Reed. but the military should have kept these records so he knew what. in fact. was wrong. He was not able. in his condition. to put together and find his old buddies that were with him 6 or 8 years earlier that could kind of recall the incidents of what happened. Christine writes that this bill is a simple. effective solution. We need to address the issues facing our veterans. Our commitment to our troops must match their commitment to our Nation. I note the absence of a quorum."

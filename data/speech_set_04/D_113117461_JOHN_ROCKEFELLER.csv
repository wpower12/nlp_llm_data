1130002067,Mr. President. I still well up with deep emotion when I see Newtown parents remembering their lost children. recalling what they wore to school that day or their last sweet words before boarding the school bus. The memory of that horrifying day. and of those children and their teachers. has not waned. nor should it ever. It should be an enduring call to action to do everything we can to save innocent lives. That is why I have championed a comprehensive approach to combating gun violence. and support the Presidents plan to protect the Nations citizens. West Virginians have a proud tradition of hunting and understand the importance of the Second Amendment. I know we can protect those traditions and rights as we look at ways to prevent senseless acts of violence. One piece of this comprehensive examination concerns violent content. including video games and video programming. I have long had concerns about how the violent content that kids see and interact with every day affects their wellbeing. This is a very important issue. and one that deserves further research. as even the President recognized. That is why. as Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. I am introducing today the Violent Content Research Act of 2013. Under this legislation. the National Academy of Sciences would conduct a comprehensive study on the connection between exposure to violent video games and video programming and harmful effects on children. Recent court decisions demonstrate that some people still do not get it. They believe that violent video games are no more dangerous to young minds than classic literature or Saturday morning cartoons. Parents. pediatricians. and psychologists know better. These court decisions show we need to conduct additional groundwork on this issue. This report would be a critical resource in this process. It could inform research by other organizations. including the Centers for Disease Control. and provide guidance to lawmakers. I call on my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation quickly. Separately. I will be calling on the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission to expand their work in this area. The FTC has reviewed the effectiveness of the video game ratings system. The FCC has looked at the impact of violent programming on children. Changes in technology now allow kids to access violent content online and increasingly from mobile platforms with less parental involvement. It is time for these two agencies to take a fresh look at these issues. Major corporations. including the video game industry. make billions on marketing and selling violent content to children. They have a responsibility to protect our children. If they do not. you can count on the Congress to take a more aggressive role. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.
1130006846,"Mr. President. today I am joining my colleagues Senators. CRAPO. WYDEN. and MORAN in introducing the Short Line Railroad Rehabilitation and Investment Act of 2013. legislation to extend for 3 years the Section 45G short line freight railroad tax credit. In the 112th Congress. I introduced a 6year extension of this credit. Despite the often contentious atmosphere of the 112th Congress. during which my colleagues found little they could agree on. the short line rail credit was a bipartisan success story. with my legislation attracting more than 50 bipartisan cosponsors. ""Short line"" railroads are small freight rail companies responsible for bringing goods to communities that are not directly served by large. transcontinental railroads. Supporting small railroads allows the communities surrounding them to attract and maintain businesses and create jobs. The evidence of the success of this credit can be found in communities across America. This credit has real impact for the people of my state. West Virginia is the second biggest producer of railroad ties in the country. Since the credit was enacted. it is estimated 750.000 railroad ties have been purchased above what would have otherwise been purchased with no incentive. Those railroad ties translate directly into jobs. This credit does not create just West Virginia jobs though. The ties. spikes. and rail this credit helps fund are almost entirely American made. Over 12.000 rail customers across America depend on short lines. This credit creates a strong incentive for short lines to invest private sector dollars on privatesector freight railroad track rehabilitation and improvements. Unfortunately. it is now scheduled to expire at the end of 2013. We were unable to enact a full 6year extension of this important tax credit last Congress. but I was pleased that this credit was extended through the end of 2013 as part of the December 31st fiscal cliff deal. This Congress I want to do more. This credit. and the short line railroads that serve all of our constituents. deserve a meaningful extension. If this credit is allowed to expire at the end of the year. privatesector investments in infrastructure in our communities will fall by hundreds of millions of dollars. This bill would extend the 45G credit through 2016. providing the important longterm planning certainty necessary to maximize privatesector transportation infrastructure investment. Over 50 members of this body sponsored legislation in the last Congress extending this credit and I hope there will be similar support again this year. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. By Mr. CORNYN (for himself. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. PORTMAN. and"
1130017724,"Mr. President. I rise today to discuss mine safety. a critical issue to my state and the tens of thousands of miners across the Nation. Earlier this month we observed the third anniversary of the Upper Big Branch mine disaster which killed twenty nine of our Nations miners. That disaster. the most deadly in decades. shocked the country and made us realize that we must aggressively and continually seek to make mining safer and we cannot restbecause no number of deaths or accidents is acceptable. In the past 3 years we have seen some positive steps in our Nations mine safety efforts. As part of the DoddFrank bill we required publiclytraded mining companies to report safety information to their shareholders through their public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Congress provided additional funds. $22 million. for MSHA and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission to reduce the appeals backlog. enforce mine safety laws and investigate the Upper Big Branch Disaster. MSHA has also pursued increased enforcement actions through their impact inspections that target violations at unsafe mines with poor compliance history or specific safety concerns. As of March 2013. the Administration had conducted 579 impact inspections. resulting in 10.036 citations. 946 orders. and 43 safeguards. The administration has finalized rules to improve the broken ""Pattern of Violations"" process to better pursue repeat offenders. While we have had these improvements we also know that 97 miners have died on the job since this tragedy. That is 97 new grieving families. That is unacceptable to me. and I think to most people. So it is clear that we must do more. That is why today I am reintroducing my comprehensive mine safety legislation the Robert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety and Health Act of 2013. We do incredibly important things in this bill including. We give MSHA expanded authority to subpoena documents and testimony. Currently. MSHA does not have the authority to subpoena documents or testimony from operators outside the context of a formal. public hearing. MSHA should have this authority in the context of investigations and inspections as well as public hearings. We provide for an independent investigation of the most serious accidents. The bill creates an independent panel. comprised of a team of independent experts. to investigate the actions of both the operator and MSHA for serious accidents. including any accident involving three or more deaths. We strengthen whistleblower protections for miners who speak out about unsafe conditions. This bill will require one hour annually of ""miners rights training"" to inform workers of the laws protections. give miners an express right to refuse unsafe work. expand the time limit for filing a complaint about retaliation from 60 to 180 days. and authorize punitive damages and criminal penalties for retaliation against workers who raise safety concerns. We increase maximum penalties. Currently. criminal violations of mine safety laws are a misdemeanor for a first offense. To provide a strong deterrent for such serious misconduct. the penalties for knowing violations of safety standards will be raised to the felony level. including providing felony penalties for miners. operators. and government officials who knowingly provide advance notice of inspections. We also increase civil penalties for making unsafe ventilation changes and violating mandatory health or safety standards for rock dusting or failing to keep the records required. These are areas of particular concern that were highlighted by investigations conducted by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. the United Mine Workers of America. and the Governors Independent Investigation. We limit Miners Exposure to Black Lung Disease. This debilitating disease is on the rise among a new generation of coal miners. Specifically. the provision would require that MSHA issue a rule within 6 months. a rule that is long overdue. to lower exposure levels to respirable dust which would provide the maximum feasible protection that is achievable through environmental controls. It would also require that MSHA reexamine the incidence of black lung disease every 5 years and. unless there is a decline in black lung. update the regulations again. More than 70 percent of the victims tested at Upper Big Branch were determined to have signs of black lung disease. We improve Federal and State Coordination to Combat Safety Violations. The Governors Independent Investigation Panel recommended that Federal and State agencies immediately work together to address safety problems at mines right after they are found out. and this provision would strongly encourage such actions. I want to be very clear that I will not give up on fighting for the safety and health of our Nations miners. Health and safety are issues that people shouldnt have to compromise on. I will continue this fight for West Virginias miners and it is my hope that more of my colleagues will join me in these efforts."
1130024384,"Mr. President. as parents. we can see the scrapes and cuts our children getthe unavoidable byproducts of growing up. A little bit of ointment and some bandages usually do the trick. But what of the injuries we cant see? The ones we cant readily tell. no matter how well we know our kids. Each year. as many as 3.8 million Americans suffer sports- and recreationrelated brain injuries. Some are horrific. deadly. and visible to the naked eye. But the vast majority are concussions caused by an awkward hit. a freak fall. or a routine blow to the head on the field. They cannot be seen. but the damage is there in the very place that houses our minds and for our children their future. Most susceptible are our young athletes. whose bodies and brains are still growing. with each concussion increasing the likelihood of suffering yet another. This past school year alone. more than 300.000 of our high school athletes were diagnosed with concussions. Since 2005. over 1.3 million concussions have been diagnosed among high school athletes in just the top nine most common sports. However. researchers say these figures likely underestimatevastlythe true extent of the epidemic because so many head injuries go unreported or ignored. And when a concussion occurs. few ever lose consciousness. and the telltale signs can seem minor in the immediate aftermath. It is only later on. perhaps the next day or weeks thereafter. when the consequences become clearer and more alarming. The urgency to act only grows the more we learn about brain injuries. Concussions arent minor bumps and dings. They arent something kids should just ""play through."" as some coaches advise. They are injuries to the brain that animate our very existence. and they can impair their cognitive abilities just when our children need a good head on their shoulders. And we. as a society. have already seen the potential tragedies that repeated concussions can bring to athletestheir limbs paralyzed or their lives cut short by the inner demons the injuries eventually bear. The role of sports. and all of its innate benefits. is an important part of growing up in America. They teach us lessons that cant be taught in the classroom. they make us healthier. and they show us the value of teamwork. grit. and responsibility. But the pervasiveness of concussions and their effects. particularly among children. should no longer be disregarded. And. as policymakers and parents. we must ensure that we are doing everything we can to learn more and safeguard our kids and athletes. Senator TOM UDALL and I are proud to introduce the Youth Sports Concussion Act. which will help ensure that protective sports equipment take heed of the latest science and are not sold based on false or deceptive premises. As chairman of the Committee on Commerce. Science. and Transportation. we have already revealed and investigated bad actors who peddle products with false safety claims to parents of young athletes. Under this legislation. the Federal Trade Commission would be able to go after them with greater force and ensure this practice comes to an end. This bill would also direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to review a forthcoming study from the National Academies of Science on youth concussions. Based on the studys recommendations. the CPSC would then be permitted to consider new safety standards for sports equipment if manufacturers fail to come up with their own. The legislationI am happy to sayhas the strong support of major sports leagues and players associations. Pediatricians. scientists. and consumer groups have endorsed it. too. Our athletes. whether peewee or professional. whether under the lights or on the pitch. inspire and bring Americans together. and their efforts to help pass this sensible bill will surely garner the appreciation of present and future athletes to come. This fall. some 3 million children under the age of 14 will don their pads and snap on their helmets to play tackle football. For a sport so importantand for lives so preciousto our country. let us make sure we act as soon as we can. The lessons imparted and the fitness gained on the field are moot without the health of our children. By Mrs. SHAHEEN:"
1130028541,"Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Fair Telephone Billing Act of 2013. This legislation would protect millions of American consumers and businesses from unauthorized charges on their wireline telephone bills. In 2011. the Senate Commerce Committee. which I chair. completed a yearlong investigation into unauthorized thirdparty charges on telephone bills. a practice commonly referred to as ""cramming."" The investigation confirmed that thirdparty billing through wireline telephone bills had likely cost American consumers and businesses billions of dollars in unauthorized charges. This legislation will put an end to cramming on wireline bills once and for all. Unauthorized thirdparty charges on telephone bills have plagued consumers for years. Cramming first emerged in the 1990s. Following the breakup of AT&T and the detariffing of ""billing and collection services"" by the Federal Communications Commission. telephone companies opened their billing and collection systems to thirdparty companies offering a variety of services. some of which were completely unrelated to telephone services. For the first time. telephone numbers worked like credit card numbers. Consumers could purchase services with their telephone numbers and the charges for these services would later appear on their telephone bills. There has been much debate over the extent to which telephone companies were required to allow third parties to place charges on customers phone bills. but the last of any Federal obligations ended in 2007. Since that time. with the exception of a few state requirements. telephone companies have been free to allow. or not allow. whatever companies they choose to place thirdparty charges on their customers telephone bills. The telephone companies chose to allow all sorts of companies to place charges for all sorts of services. Throughout the 1990s. state and federal law enforcement saw a dramatic increase in complaints about unauthorized charges on telephone bills. In response. the Federal Communications Commission and the telephone industry created voluntary guidelines to combat cramming. Throughout this same period. Congress also convened hearings on the issue. and each time. the telephone industry used these voluntary guidelines to argue that congressional action on cramming was not needed. Several bills were introduced. but none were adopted. Now we find ourselves. over a decade later. still discussing cramming. We cannot make the same mistake again. In 2010. I opened the Committees investigation into cramming to better understand the scope of the cramming problem. The investigation showed that over the past decade. cramming caused extensive financial harm to all types of wireline telephone customers. from residences and small businesses. to government agencies and large companies. All the while. the largest telephone companies were making large profits. likely generating over $1 billion in revenue by placing thirdparty charges on their customers telephone bills. It was shocking to learn that many thirdparty vendors that were placing charges on telephone bills were illegitimate and appeared to have been created solely to exploit a broken system. Consumers reported being charged $10 to $30 a month for socalled ""services"" that they never authorized. These included weekly email messages with ""celebrity gossip"" and ""fashion tips."" and others completely unrelated to wireline telephone servicessuch as ""online photo storage"" and ""electronic facsimile."" In some of the most egregious examples. unauthorized charges had been added to the bills for telephone lines dedicated to fire alarms. security systems. bank vaults. elevators. and 911 services. The Committee investigation also determined that many of the services being charged to consumers telephone bills seemed to serve no legitimate purpose. frequently did not function properly. and were often available elsewhere for free. The investigation involved a review of thousands of consumer complaints and interviews with more than 500 individuals and business owners whose telephone bills included charges from third parties. Not one of these individuals or entities believed they had authorized the charges. Further. many of these consumers complained that when they found unauthorized charges on their telephone bills. they were unable to get the money refunded. either from the carrier or from the thirdparty vendor. That is unacceptable. In response to the Committees investigation. the three largest wireline telephone companiesAT&T. Verizon. and CenturyLinktook positive steps to eliminate cramming on wireline telephone bills. including a decision to stop allowing the placement of most thirdparty charges on wireline telephone bills. The Fair Telephone Billing Act will ensure that all wireline telephone companies and providers of interconnected VoIP services are required to take the same steps so that cramming on telephone bills never happens again. In short. the bill would prohibit any local exchange carrier or provider of interconnected VoIP services from placing any thirdparty charge on a customers bill. unless the charge is for a telephonerelated service or a ""bundled"" service that is jointly marketed or sold with a companys telephone service. Under the bill. a telephone company that places prohibited charges on a customers bill is responsible for refunding to the customer any charge for services the customer did not authorize. The bill also includes a narrow exception for two categories of thirdparty billing services: telephonerelated services. such as collect calls. and ""bundled"" services. such as satellite television services offered together with phone service. This bill recognizes that such legitimate types of billing offer substantial benefit to consumers. In recent years. increasing numbers of consumers have transitioned from traditional wireline telephone service to interconnected VoIP services and more are expected. Since consumers likely do not see a distinction between traditional wireline service and interconnected VoIP services. I believe these services need to be included. It is important to ensure that all telephone customers are offered the same protections from unauthorized charges. It also has become clear that cramming now extends to wireless bills. When I introduced a similar bill last year. I included provisions that would have directed the Federal Communications Commission to create rules to prevent cramming on wireless telephone bills. Since that time. the Senate Commerce Committee has been examining cramming on wireless bills. and I believe this issue demands additional attention. I do not want to see in a few years that cramming has simply migrated from wireline to wireless. It is important that we examine the extent to which thirdparty wireless billing practices raise any issues distinct from thirdparty wireline billing practices. so we can best determine appropriate policies for protecting against consumer abuses in this context. Cramming has likely already cost consumers and businesses billions. The Fair Telephone Billing Act would stop practices that Congress. regulators. and consumers agree are nothing more than a cover for fraud. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD."
1130041283,Mr. President. the cybersecurity legislation Senator THUNE and I introduce today is built upon several years of bipartisan hard work on the Senate Commerce. Science. and Transportation Committee. I am proud of that fact and proud of our work product. I would like to sincerely thank Senator THUNE for working closely with me on this legislation. Senator THUNE appreciates the gravity of the cybersecurity threat to our national security and our economya genuine threat to the free flow of commerce. He has been laser focused in finding workable. private sector led solutions to mitigate this existential threat. Our bill will go a long way to better secure our nation from ongoing cyber threats by having the National Institute of Standards and Technology. NIST. a worldclass. nonregulatory agency within the Department of Commercefacilitate and support the development of voluntary. industryled standards and best practices to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure and all businesses. Our bill will give NIST the permanent authority it needs to continue the standards development process initiated by the Presidents Executive Order on Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity to ensure such efforts remain industry led and voluntary. It will also make sure that the Federal Government supports cutting edge research. works to increase public awareness. and improves our workforce to better address cyber threats. Our countrys future economic success and security demands prompt attention to the cyber threat. It demands we all pull together to face the reality of cyber intrusions into every aspect of our nations business. our electric grid. our trade secrets. our water supply. and so much more. The stakes are great. This is about our national security3 Directors of National Intelligence have said cyber attacks are the number 1 national security threat to our country. That is why we have to find a way to reach a consensus that allows us to responsibly legislate. This bill is a very good start. There is a lot more we can and should do to protect our critical infrastructure. including promoting more sharing of private sector threat information. I will certainly keep looking for ways to work with my colleagues to provide this nation with the tools and resources we need to take on this threat. Again. I thank Senator THUNE for dedicating his time. talent. and energy to this legislation. and his fine staff. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.
1130046528,Mr. President. throughout my career in the Senate. I have been proud to fight tirelessly for policies that will help vulnerable children in our foster care system find the permanent homes they need and deserve. I have been very proud of the Finance Committees bipartisan work over the years to encourage adoption and enhance child welfare services for our most vulnerable children. That work would not have been possible without the commitment of Chairman BAUCUS. as well as my other colleagues that I have been so proud to work with over the years. Our goal has always been to improve our Federal laws related to adoption and foster care. so that every child has an opportunity to have a loving. safe home and a successful future. To build on our history of encouraging safe and stable families. Senator CASEY and I are introducing the Removing Barriers to Adoption and Supporting Families Act of 2013. This legislation outlines our vision for a path to increase the number of successful adoptions from foster care in our country. Doing so. we believe. can improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of children in our foster care system. This legislation encourages safe and stable families. and takes a number of important steps forward to ensure that permanency is paramount for children in our foster care system. First. the legislation puts incentives in place to help encourage interstate adoptions. creating a shared incentive for states that work together to connect children in foster care with families who are ready and willing to provide loving homes. but who happen to live across state lines. It also helps facilitate interstate adoptions further through better data tracking and development of national standards for home studies. a requirement before a child can be adopted. Second. the bill aims to establish permanency for youth by eliminating longterm foster care as a goal for children under 17. We also request a study to learn more about why longterm foster care has been set as a goal for some youth. We believe the study will further inform our overall goal of connecting these children to permanent families and caring adults. But. simply put. we believe permanent foster care should not be a goal for children who are younger than 17. Third. this legislation dedicates funding to postadoption and postpermanency support services for children who are adopted. or are permanently in the care of a relative or guardian. This is an important step to make sure that families receive support after a child becomes a family member and. more broadly. can help make sure more adoptions and permanent placements are successful. Additionally. the legislation requires states to engage in publicprivate partnerships and enhanced strategies to find more permanent placements for older youth who are most at risk of aging out of foster care. Among our foster care population. these are some of our most vulnerable and valuable young people who are most in need of guidance and a loving. nurturing home. Finally. this legislation would do more to keep siblings together after they are removed from an unsafe home. The bond between siblings is unique and often an important source of stability for children. Unfortunately. once a child joins a permanent home through adoption. there are sometimes barriers to maintaining sibling relationships under current Federal law. Our legislation helps to remove these barriers by strengthening the opportunities for sibling relationships and joint placement. and making sure that the parents of siblings are given notice if their brother or sister enters foster care. Our legislation lays out an important vision for how we can improve adoption and foster care in our country. Adoptions from foster care have increased in recent years. which means that more families are stepping up to adopt children who are in vulnerable situations through no fault of their own. But. we have far more to do to ensure that every child in foster care has this opportunity. I am extremely grateful to many of the adoption advocates. including the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. Voice for Adoption. and Listening to Parents. among others. who have been so instrumental in developing recommendations and moving this and other related proposals forward. Together. we can make great strides toward improving opportunities for the nearly 400.000 children in foster care. of which 102.000 are waiting to find forever families through adoption. New data from the Department of Health and Human Services on adoption and foster care suggests that while the number of children in foster care remains steady. the adoption rate continues to climb. Last year alone. 52.000 children were adopted from foster care and for each of those children. being adopted is a positive. affirming. and lifechanging event. Through our work. we can provide more of these opportunities for children in foster care. and set them up to have successful lives with forever families. By Mr. McCONNELL:
1130063855,Mr. President. I am proud today to introduce the Child Support Enforcement Effectiveness Act of 2013. This legislation will set the stage for improving child support enforcement across our country. and will provide states with more funds to allow them to do so. Through these crucial investments in this important child welfare program. we can improve the lives of thousands of children across our country. Child support enforcement is a StateFederal partnership that works. For every dollar agencies and departments spend on child support enforcement. states collect an average of $5.19 in child support due. For that reason alone. this is an extraordinary use of taxpayer dollars. In 2010. the child support enforcement program allowed States to collect more than $26 billion on behalf of the children and families to whom that money is owed. There is no question that these children benefit because they receive support from both their parents. In addition to being an effective use of taxpayer dollars. child support enforcement is one of our most important investments in child welfare. Experts have repeatedly found that it is one of the most effective programs in reducing poverty rates among working families. For single parents below the poverty line. child support often represents as much as half of their familys income. and makes the difference between whether childrens basic needs are met or not. Because of the tremendous success of the child support enforcement program. we should work to improve it even further. One way we can improve it is by identifying best practices at the state level. so every state can maximize their return. West Virginia recovers about $4.99 for each dollar it spends on child support enforcement. Some states recover substantially more for each dollar they spend. By arming every State with information about what works and what doesnt. we can help States maximize the return on their investment and recover the largest possible amount on behalf of children. This legislation would also permanently restore full funding for child support enforcement by reinstating the Federal match for incentive payments that States reinvest in their child support enforcement programs. By providing the resources for States to have robust child support enforcement programs. we can profoundly improve the lives of so many children across our Nation. By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself and Mr. WYDEN):
1130125064,"Madam President. I come to the floor to wholly support the comments of my colleagues. the Senator from California and the Senator from Arizona. to speak about a matter of great importance to me personally but more importantly to the country. The Senate Intelligence Committees entire study of the CIAs detention and interrogation programI will just call it the programis the most indepth. the most substantive oversight initiative the committee has ever taken. I doubt any committee has done more than this. It presents extremely valuable insights into crucial oversight questions and problems that need to be addressed by the CIA. Moreover. this study exemplifies why this committee was created in the first place following the findings of the Church Committee nearly 40 years ago. and I commend my friend and the committees leader. the Senator from California. for shepherding this landmark initiative to this point. For years. often behind closed doors. without any recognition. she has been a strong and tireless advocate. and she deserves our thanks and recognition. It is my hope and expectation that beyond the initial release of the executive summary and findings and conclusions. that the entire 6.800 pages. with 37.500 footnotes. will eventually be made publicand I am sure it willwith the appropriate redactions. Those public findings will be critical to fully learning the necessary lessons from this dark episode in our Nations history and to ensure that it never happens again. It has been a very long. very hard fight to get to this point. Especially in the early years of the CIAs detention program. it was a struggle for the committee to get the most basic information or any information at all about the program. The committees study of the detention and interrogation program is not just the story of the brutal and illconceived program itself. this study is also the story of the breakdown in our system of governance that allowed the country to deviate in such a significant and horrific way from our core principles. One of the profound ways that breakdown happened was through the active subversion of meaningful congressional oversighta theme mirrored in the Bush administrations warrantless wiretapping program during that same period. I first learned about some aspects of the CIAs detention and interrogation program in 2003 when I became vice chair of the committee. At that point and for years after. the CIA refused to provide me or anybody else with any additional information about the program. They further refused to notify the full committee about the programs existence. My colleagues will remember there was always the Gang of 4. the Gang of 6. or the Gang of 8. They would take the chairman and vice chairman. take them to the White House. give them a flip chart. 45 minutes for the Vice President. and off he would go. Senator ROBERTS and I went down by car and were instructed we couldnt talk to each other on the way back from one of those meetings. It was absurd. They refused to do anything to be of assistance. The briefings I received provided little or no insight into the CIAs program. Questions or followup requests were rejected. and at times I was not allowed to consult with my counsel. I am not a lawyer. There are legal matters involved here. They said we couldnt talk to any of our staff. legal counsel or not. or other members of the committee who knew nothing about this because they had not been informed at all. It was clear these briefings were not meant to answer any questions but were intended only to provide cover for the administration and the CIA. It was infuriating to me to realize I was part of a box checking exercise that the administration planned to use. and later did use. so they could disingenuously claim they hadin a phrase I will never be able to forget-""fully briefed Congress."" In the years that followed I fought and lost many battles to obtain credible information about the detention and interrogation program. As vice chair I tried to launch. as has been mentioned. a comprehensive investigation into the program. but that effort was blocked. Later in 2005. when I fought for access to over 100 specific documents cited in the inspector general report. the CIA refused to cooperate. The first time the full Senate Intelligence Committee was given any information about this detention program was September 2006. This was years after the programs inception and the same day the President informed the Nation. The following year when I became chairman. the vice chairman. Kit Bond. and I agreed to push for significant additional access to the program. For heavens sake. at least allow both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. on a full basis. to be informed about this and also to include our staffs counsel on these matters. We finally actually prevailed and got this access. I think I withheld something from them until they agreed to do that which enabled us to have muchneeded hearings on the program. which we proceeded to do. As chairman. I made sure we scrutinized it from every angle. However. the challenge of getting accurate information from the CIA persisted. It was during this period that the House and Senate considered the 2008 Intelligence Authorization Act and a potential provision that set the Army Field Manualwhich is the only way to goas the standard for the entire American Government. including the CIA. This would have effectively ended the CIAs enhanced interrogation techniques. a term eerily sanitized in bureaucratic jargon for what. in a number of cases. amounted to torture. As chairman. I knew the inclusion of the Army Field Manual provision would jeopardize the entire bill. I thought it might bring it down. People would think it was too soft or too radical or whatever. but I was committed to seeing the bill signed into law. In the end. it was an easy decision. I supported including the provision to end the CIAs program because it was the right thing to do. I did it because Congress needed to send a clear signal that it did not stand by the Bush administrations policy. The House and Senate went on to pass the bill with bipartisan votes. Although the Bush administration vetoed the bill to preserve its ability to continue these practices. it was an important symbolic moment. In the same period. I also sent two committee staffers. as our chairwoman has indicated. to begin reviewing cables at the CIA regarding the agencys interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and alNashiri. I firmly believed we had to review those cables. which are now the only source of important historical information on this subject. because the CIA destroyed its tapes of some of their interrogation sessions. The CIA destroyed those tapes against the explicit direction from the White House and the Director of National Intelligence. The investigation that began in 2007 grew under Chairman FEINSTEINs dedication and tremendous leadership into a full study of the CIAs detention and interrogation program. The more the committee dug. the more the committee found. and the results we uncovered are both shocking and deeply troubling. First. the detention and interrogation program was conceived by people who were ignorant of the topic and made it up on the fly based on the untested theories of contractors who had never met a terrorist or conducted a realworld interrogation of any kind. Second. it was executed by personnel with insufficient linguistic and interrogation training and little. if any. realworld experience. Moreover. the CIA was aware that some of these personnel had a staggering array of personal and professional failingsenumerated by the committees chairmanincluding potentially criminal activity. that should have disqualified them immediately not only from being interrogators but from being employed by the CIA or anybody in government. Nevertheless. it was consistently represented that these interrogators were professionalized and carefully vettedtheir termand that became a part of the hollow legal justification of the entire program. Third. the program was managed incompetently by senior officials who paid little or no attention to critical details. It was rife with troubling personal and financial conflicts of interest among the small group of the CIA officials and contractors who promoted and defended it. Obviously it was in their interest to do so. Fourth. as the chairman indicated. the program was physically very severe. far more so than any of us outside the CIA ever knew. Although waterboarding has received the most attention. there were other techniques I personally believeone in particularthat may have been much worse. Finally. its results were unclear at best. but it was presented to the White House. the Department of Justice. the Congress. and the media as a silver bullet that was indispensable to saving lives. That was their mantra. In fact. it did not provide the intelligence it was supposed to provide or the CIA argued that it did provide. To be perfectly clear. these harsh techniques were not approved by anyone ever for the lowbar standard of learning useful information from detainees. These techniques were approved because the Bush officials were told. and therefore believed. that these coercive interrogations were absolutely necessary to elicit intelligence that was unavailable by any other collection method and would save American lives. That was simply not the case. For me. personally. the are of this story comprises more than a decade of my 30 years of work in the Senate and one of the hardest fightsI think the hardest fightI have ever been through. Many of the worst years were during the Bush administration. However. I did not fully anticipate how hard these last few years would be in this administration to get this summary declassified and to tell the full story of what happened. Indeed. to my great frustration. even after months of endless negotiations. significant aspects of the story remain obscured by black ink. I have great admiration for the President. and I am appreciative of the leadership role he has taken to depart from the practices of the Bush administration on these issues. His Executive order formally ended the CIAs detention program practices. and that is a good example. It is a great example. It was. therefore. with deep disappointment that over the course of a number of private meetings and conversations I came to feel that the White Houses strong deference to the CIA throughout this process has at times worked at crosspurposes with the White Houses stated interest in transparency and has muddied what should be a clear and unequivocal legacy on this issue. While aspiring to be the most transparent administration in history. this White House continues to quietly withhold from the committee more than 9.000 documents related to the CIAs programs. I dont know why. They wont say. and they wont produce. In addition to strongly supporting the CIAs insistence on the unprecedented redaction of fake names in the report. which obscures the publics ability to understand the important connections which are so important for weaving together the tapestry. the administration also pushed for the redaction of information in the committees study that should not be classified. contradicting the administrations own Executive order on classification. Let me be clear. That order clearly states that in no case shall information fail to be declassified in order to conceal violations of law and efficiency or administrative error or prevent embarrassment to a person. organization. or agency. In some instances. the White House asked not only that information be redacted but that the redaction itself be removed so it would be impossible for the reader to tell that something was already hidden. Strange. Given this. looking back. I am deeply disappointed. rather than surprised. that even when the CIA inexplicably conducted an unauthorized search of the committees computer files and emails at an offsite facility. which was potentially criminal. and even when it became clear that the intent of the search was to suppress the committees awareness of an internal CIA review that corroborated parts of the intelligence committees study and contradicted public CIA statements. the White House continued to support the CIA leadership. and that support was unflinching. Despite these frustrations. I have also seen how hard Chairman FEINSTEIN has fought against great odds. stubborn odds. protective odds. mysterious odds. which are not really clear to me. I have tried to support her thoughtful and determined efforts at every opportunity to make sure as much as of the story can be told as possible. and I am deeply proud of the product the committee ended up with. Now it is time to move forward. For all of the misinformation. incompetence. and brutality of the CIAs program. the committees study is not and must not be simply a backwardlooking condemnation of the past. The study presents a tremendous opportunity to develop forwardlooking lessons that must be central to all future activities. The point has been madeI thoroughly agreethat the vast majority of people who work at the CIAand there are tens and tens of thousands of themdo very good work and are working very hard and have absolutely nothing to do with any of this. But if this report had not been released. the country would have felt that everybody at the CIAand the world would have felt itwas involved in this program. It is important to say that that was not the case. It was just 30 or 40 people at the top. Many of the people you see on television blasting this report were intimately involved in carrying it out and setting it up. The CIA developed the detention program in a time of great fear. anxiety. and unprecedented crisis. It is at these times of crisis when we need sound judgment. excellence. and professionalism from the CIA the most. When mistakes are made. they call for selfreflection and scrutiny. For that process to begin. we first have to make sure there is an absolutely accurate public record of what happened. We are doing that. The public release of the executive summary and findings and conclusions is a tremendous and consequential step toward that end. For some. I expect there will be the temptation to reject and cast doubt. to trivialize. to attack or rationalize parts of the study that are disturbing or are embarrassing. Indeed. the CIA programs dramatic divergence from the standards that we hold ourselves to is hard to reconcile. However. we must fight that shortsighted temptation to wish away the gravity of what this study found. How we deal with this opportunity to learn and improve will reflect on the maturity of our democracy. As a country. we are strong enough to bear the weight of the mistakes we have made. As an institution. so is the Central Intelligence Agency. We must confront this dark period in our recent history with honesty and critical introspection. We must draw lessons. and we must apply those lessons as we move forward. Although it may be uncomfortable at times. ultimately we will grow stronger. and we will ensure that this never happens again. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor."

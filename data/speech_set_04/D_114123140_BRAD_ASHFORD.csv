1140012433,"Thank you. Mr. COSTA. I am privileged to have the opportunity to speak today. Mr. Speaker. you mentioned. just briefly. the concept of ""Profiles of Courage."" John Kennedy. in writing that book. wrote about a great Nebraskan. George Norris. George Norris was a Senator from Nebraska. and prior to that time. he served in this House. In 1908. he led a bipartisan effort in the House to change the rules of the House in order to make the House more transparent and more accountable to the American people. In that regard. in John Kennedys book he wrote about Congressman Norris. and then. subsequently. Senator Norris. In the 1930s. Senator Norris. who had worked to create the Tennessee Valley Authority. worked across the aisle with FDRhe was a Republicanto pass the Rural Electrification Act that electrified the country. He did so working across the aisle. And in the 1930sand 1934. specificallyhe reached out to the people of Nebraska and said to them: We can do better. We can have a more transparent government. We can have a bipartisan. nonpartisan government that will address the tough issues of Nebraska in the Depression of the 1930s. And he recommended to the voters: Look. lets do this. Lets have a unicameral. nonpartisan legislature. And the lobbyists and the special interests said: George. you should go back to Washington. This isnt going to work in Nebraska. Well. the voters of Nebraska. in 1934. voted for a unicameral. nonpartisan legislature. and I am proud to say that we have such a legislature today. I am so proud and honored to be here. There was a discussion earlier by prior speakers about relationships. And what is so interesting to me and amazing to menot amazing. really. but gratifyingare those relationships. are the relationships that I have been able to achieve through my association with the Blue Dogs and relationships with Republicans and Democrats alike. It is very. very gratifying that that exists. That is what I am used to in Nebraska. When I first arrived here. I went to a Democratic Caucus. I served in the Nebraska unicameral legislature for 16 years. I never went to a caucus in my life. I didnt really know exactly what a Democrat or Republican really was. I suppose I would have to look. but of the 49 members of the Nebraska Legislature. I would have to think long and hard about what party they belonged to. And in the 16 years that I served there. we had many tough issues. In fact. one of the toughest issues we had in the State was the pipeline issue. and that was referenced earlierthe TransCanada pipeline. Well. it goes through Nebraska. As originally routed. it would have gone through some of the most sensitive areas of our State. the Sandhills area and the Ogallala Aquifer. We spent a year together. the 49 of us. Not every day. We would kill each other if we spent every day together. but we spent a lot of time. At the end of the day. we came up with a process to reroute the TransCanada pipeline to move it away from the most sensitive parties of the Ogallala Aquifer. We did it with a vote of 490. environmentalists and those on the other side of the issue coming together to pass a routing bill. So the idea that George Norris had was. number one. be transparent. Let the people of Nebraska know exactly what you are doing. What is interesting about the 16 years that I was thereand. quite frankly. if you do count Republicans and Democrats in the unicameral legislature. you will find that there are a lot more Republicans. traditionally. than there are Democrats. at least during the 16 years I was there. and I dont think that at any time I was there. any year. any legislative session I was there. that there were not an equal number of committee chairs that were Republican and Democrat. There was nothing magic about that. It was just the way we balanced things out in our State. We did it and do it intuitively. We do it intuitively. I dont suggest that we are going to decide tomorrow or even next year or 10 years from now to have a unicameral. bipartisan. nonpartisan legislature. but the lessons that I learned there are the lessons that I have brought here. And when I had the opportunity. Mr. COSTA. to meet the Blue Dogs. it reminded me of home. It reminded me of the Nebraska Legislature and the idea that Republicans and Democrats make that decision for themselves. But as my good friend and former Senator from Nebraska Ed Zorinsky used to say. there are no Republican Senators or Democratic Senators. There are only American Senators. U.S. Senators. It is in the water in Nebraska. That is how we think. That is how we are. And what is great about this place is those same relationships. those same committed people are there to make those kinds of relationships work in a bipartisan way. We have heard examples of that today. When I ran for this office. I said to the voters of the Second Congressional District of Nebraska. Sarpy County and Douglas County. Nebraska. the two most populace counties: Im going to go to Washington. and Im going to make 25 friends. Because in Nebraska. if you make 25 friends. you get 25 people to vote for a bill. it passes. You know what? I found more than 25 friends. I found a lot of friends. a lot of great people who sit in this body. this place. every single day. Republicans and Democrats. I just got backand then I will conclude. Mr. COSTAfrom a trip to Afghanistan. Iraq. Jordan. the Emirates. and Kuwait. I went with three other Members: ELISE STEFANIK. who is a freshman Republican from New York. JOE WILSON. who is a veteran Member from South Carolina. and SETH MOULTON. who is a freshman from Massachusetts. What great people. What great committed Americans to have gone on that trip. So. Mr. Speaker. I commend the Blue Dogs to the country. to those that are watching. in furtherance of the old tradition of transparency and working together and making things happen."
1140037473,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. I would like to commend my colleague Congressman FORTENBERRY for his work on this issue and his words. which are right on. I would like to thank as well the chairman for his words. which accurately describe the history of Boys Town. Let me also thank the ranking member for her comments that so accurately reflect what Boys Town means to our community and to the entire country. I grew up around Boys Town. I grew up playing sports at Boys Town. The high school that I went to. Boys Town was in our conference. and we spent many very difficult nights playing basketball against the Boys Town basketball team which. quite frankly. was better than we were on most every occasion. In my years in the legislature that lasted until last year. I had the opportunity to work with a colleague of mine. Senator Bob Krist from Omaha. who spearheaded significant juvenile justice reform in our State. The child welfare system in Nebraska was in deep trouble. and Senator Krist. along with Father Boes. who is the acclaimed and incredibly competent leader at Boys Town. we passed significant juvenile justice legislation that helps families throughout the State of Nebraska. that deals with brain development. that deals with wraparound services. family services. as was so aptly described by my colleague Congressman FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker. we are changing lives in Nebraska. and. as has been mentioned. Boys Town is changing lives throughout the country. Their unique approach to juvenile justice issues. the wraparound familycentered services that deal with not only the parents but the siblings to help bring these young people into a productive life. is what Boys Town has been about for the 100 years that it has been in existence. It is no longer there. but I remember as a child in the 1950s actually seeing the first Boys Town facility in downtown Omaha. When I was growing up. Boys Town was way out of town. It had a farm around it. The farm is still there. but now. it is in the middle of Omaha. as Omaha grows. Though it is in a different place in the world today than it was in 1917 with Father Flanagan. by bringing business leaders in Omaha together and others to create Boys Town. it serves that grand purpose that Father Flanagan envisioned in 1917. Mr. Speaker. it is with great pride that I thank the ranking member for giving me this opportunity to speak.
1140091179,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in honor of the retirement of Dr. Phil Smith of Nebraska Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Over 35 years ago. Dr. Smith established the Nebraska Infection Control Network to educate healthcare professionals regarding infection control in nursing homes and hospitals. Dr. Smith is a pioneer in the field of infectious disease. and his perseverance and dedication led to the establishment of the very critical biocontainment unit at Nebraska Medicine in 2005. Commissioned by the Centers for Disease Control. the unit was at ground zero in the fight against Ebola. providing Ebola training to more than 30 of the countrys top hospitals while successfully treating several Ebola patients. Dr. Rick Sacra. who contracted the disease in West Africa. credits the Omaha unit with saving his life. Recently. Dr. Smith codeveloped the Center for Preparedness Education. a coalition between the University of Nebraska Medical Center and Creighton University Medical Center. It is very difficult to sum up this career that he has had. What is critical. though. is that the Ebola problem and crisis is not going away. The University of Nebraska Medical Center. the community that I come from. Omaha. Nebraska. and the entire State of Nebraska are committed to fighting Ebola. It will continue to do so by developing an even more significant biocontainment center. developing teaching regimens. and developing research regimens at the University of Nebraska Medical Center to fight Ebola and other infectious diseases. It is difficult to sum up the career that Dr. Smith has had. but I will quote this. He says: ""Patient care has been part of my life. Its a noble profession. and nothing beats the gratification of making a diagnosis and helping a patient."" Nothing is more critical than the treatment of the Ebola crisis at the University of Nebraska. Saving lives. creating an atmosphere for further research. and creating a facility for training healthcare professionals from around the world is the mission that the University of Nebraska has taken up. Dr. Smiths contributions to Nebraska and our Nation are immeasurable. and we are grateful for his service. Interestingly enough. the University of Nebraska biocontainment unit is now in the capable hands of Dr. Angie Hewitt. who is the daughter of one of our colleagues. Representative GENE GREEN of Texas. Dr. Hewitt will continue the work that Dr. Smith has begun and will continue to enlarge and engage the world in the fight against infectious disease."

We have lost many brave men and women who have left this country to protect our life. and I am proud and humbled to stand here before this House to honor the life and bravery of one of those men today.

1130011160,Mr. Chair. I support the Democratic budget. It is a responsible roadmap that invests in our future and approaches deficit reduction in a balanced way. It accomplishes this without singling out domestic energy production with unfair tax provisions. I cannot support the Republican budget. It cuts taxes for the wealthy and pays for it by raising taxes on middle income earners and betraying our commitment to our seniors. It is misguided and does not reflect the values Americans hold dear. The Republican budget slashes Medicaid. which provides necessary care to our nations most vulnerable. especially lowincome seniors and children. Denying them the care they need does not make the costs go away. it just shifts the burden on to doctors. hospitals. nonprofits. and others. The Majority budget repeats the same tired and failed tactic of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Repeal increases the deficit and means Seniors will pay more for prescription drugs. receive less preventive care. and bring back the days of abusive insurance companies capping coverage and denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions. Alternatively. the Democratic budget makes good on the commitments we have made to our Seniors. It makes sure that the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented and that the benefits are maximized to protect patients and begin to bring down the cost of healthcare. This budget also provides the necessary funding for medical research. which will spur the innovations of the future that end disease and improve outcomes. Additionally. I appreciate the Ranking Member for making education a top priority in this budget. Investing in education is key to growing our economy. strengthening the middle class. allowing for upward mobility and ensuring our children and grandchildren have brighter futures than previous generations. Robust early education programs. jobs initiatives and financial aid programs to make college more affordable invest in our future and build a stronger America in the longterm. Making it harder for outofwork Americans to get job training or for families to access quality early learning programs undermines the strength of our workforce and diminishes our ability to compete in the global economy. Spending on domestic programs is already on track to be at the lowest level as a percentage of the economy since the 1960s. but the Ryan budget would make even deeper cuts. It imposes spending caps on nondefense programs for two additional years at a level that is $700 billion below the level set by the Sequester. It slashes billions of dollars in mandatory funding for Pell Grants and allows interest rates on student loans to double this summer at a time when student loan debt is nearing $1 trillion and is the only type of household debt that continued to rise through the Great Recession. We should be working to help Americans who seek to better their livelihood through higher education rather than allowing them to be crushed by debt or denied access due to skyrocketing costs. Under the Ryan budget. students will face larger class sizes. more debt. fewer afterschool programs. and less support for special needs. Robust funding for educational investments is critical to growing our economy. Cutting these programs shortchanges our future and threatens the ability of our children to pursue the American Dream. Finally. I want to thank our Ranking Member on the House Budget Committee and Democratic Leadership for not including provisions in this budget that would unfairly singleout and punish our domestic energy industry by repealing tax provisions for them that are afforded to any business operating in our country. The oil and natural gas industry is one of the largest employers in our country. supporting more than 9.2 million jobs. In fact. this industry delivers $86 million a day to the federal government in revenue. Any changes to these tax incentives should be addressed in the context of comprehensive tax reform and not a budget.
1130049759,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the Drug Quality and Security Act. This important bill is the result of weeks of bipartisan and bicameral negotiations. I want to thank my colleagues. Representatives MORGAN GRIFFITH and DIANA DEGETTE. for joining me in our efforts over many months. I also want to thank Chairman UPTON. Ranking Member WAXMAN. Chairman PITTS. Ranking Member PALLONE. Chairman Emeritus DINGELL. and my good friend Congressman MATHESON for all their leadership through this process and their commitment to getting this final product to the floor. It was a group effort. which is how this body should function all the time. This bill is not perfect. We heard those concerns. and we have tried to address them. but the nature of compromise is not getting everything. The Energy and Commerce Committee investigated last years outbreak and found there were breakdowns in the regulations at the State and. most concerning. at the Federal level. Large operators were able to sell products interstate in an unregulated gray area. In the case of the NECC. their sterile facilities were far from sterile. They operated without fear of penalties for far too long. and people died because of that. Im proud to say that this bill fixes the problems that led to the fungal meningitis outbreak. and it requires the FDA to succeed where it failed in the past. Bad actors concerned more with profit than with public health ought not to be able to operate with impunity again. I hope that the FDA uses their enforcement discretion to maintain patient access to important drugs from nuclear pharmacies. certain repackaged drugs. and drugs for ""office use."" While I acknowledge there are problems. it is most important that we act to protect the public health. Our constituents. when they seek care. will now have the confidence that a sterile compounded product really is sterile. We must make sure another fungal meningitis outbreak is never allowed to occur again. This bill succeeds in that goal. and I am proud to support it."
1130062788,Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague. I rise today in opposition to the rule and to H.R. 1900. As many of my colleagues are aware. natural gas is extremely important to the State of Texas. It seems like every day more and more natural gas deposits are being found. More importantly. with the commercialization of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. we are now able to develop these resources effectively and economically. but that is only half the story. Once we have found these resources. we need a way to move them to market in a safe and environmentally responsible way. In 1956. the United States decided it was in our best interest to build a network of highways. These highways. totaling approximately 47.000 miles. moved goods to market and dramatically expanded commerce. It may surprise some. but the interstate and intrastate pipeline system is approximately seven times larger than the highway system in the United States. The natural gas pipeline system in this country is critical and extensive infrastructure. The permitting and review process that is required to site and construct pipelines in this country has ensured an environmental safety record that is second to none. That doesnt mean there arent still going to be problems. when you consider the amount of miles we have. Unfortunately. I cant support this particular bill. I support an expedited review process and expansion of the pipeline system. Our intrastate natural gas pipeline system is not broken. I cannot support a bill that would issue a license or permit or approval after merely an expired time line. In testimony in our committee. the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. the FERC. has an average of about a year turnaround. I want to continue to support the construction of pipelines. and my ardent support is firmly backed by a safety record that is unmatched. I will continue to support an industry that has been an engine of our economic growth for the last decade. This bill is a solution in search of a problem. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future on another approach that will benefit all stakeholders. our environment. and our economy. I encourage my colleagues to oppose the rule and the bill.
1130102208,"I thank my colleague on the Rules Committee for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker. I rise today on the rule for both H.R. 6 and H.R. 3301. and I will address both of these bills. I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 3301 and a recent cosponsor to H.R. 6 after we amended it out of our committee. As for H.R. 3301. this legislation would create a North American energy market with our free trading partners Canada and Mexico. If we want to create this market. we need to have statutory authority. It is true that the Presidential permitting process dates back through many administrations. but to really create this market. we need some certainty. and that is why it should be in statute. These past administrations were forced to use executive orders. but Congress has failed to act. Congress has the duty to regulate the commerce of the United States. and crossborder energy infrastructure projects fall well within that space. Unfortunately. crossborder decisions have now fallen victim to election cycles and political considerations. H.R. 3301 will resolve these issues and those proposed by the amendments debated here today. Let me say that I wish we had an open rule. Some of the amendments considered by the Rules Committee I would have liked to have voted for. but lets not take that away from the quality of these two pieces of legislation. H.R. 3301 provides for an environmental review of the crossborder segment of the pipeline. The entire length of the pipeline is reviewed for environmental impacts under existing law. Any time a pipeline crosses Federal lands. waters. endangered habitats. a National Environmental Policy Act reviewalso known as ""NEPA""-must be completed by the Federal Government. Otherwise. the environmental permit must come from the State environmental agency if it is within the State. There are more than 40.000 miles of pipeline in the U.S. that have been constructed with indepth environmental reviews. This will continue to be the case. H.R. 3301 doesnt take anything away except the State Department only has to deal with their responsibility in its coming from Canada to the United States or from Mexico to the United States or vice versa. There will be environmental reviews by Federal agencies and State agencies. and this will continue to be the case."
1130102313,"Mr. Chairman. I thank my colleague for yielding to me. As ranking member on the Health Subcommittee. I. too. am hesitant to rise and oppose your amendment. What the amendment would do is it would ensure that the complete length of crossborder projects would be subject to full environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act. The bill already guarantees that review at the national boundary based with the Department of Energy. Existing Federal and State law guarantees an environmental review on the complete length of the project. Current Federal laws that trigger NEPA reviews in addition to H.R. 3301 include the Clean Water Act. the Clean Air Act. the Endangered Species Act. the Mineral Leasing Act. the Rivers and Harbors Act. the Fish and Wildlife Coordination for Fish and Wildlife Service consultation. the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. the Wilderness Act. and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The intent of this bill is not to eliminate any of the NEPA reviews within the continental United States. The problem we have right now is the Department of State is making a decision that really ought to be Federal agencies and even State governments who would need that. If this amendment was adopted. it would require a State Department or a Presidential permit. and then all of the other agencies. and so it would make it impossible. The argument for this bill. if you are opposed to Keystone. then you are allowing literally a thousandcar train of crude oil to come across the border now without any of these reviews. A pipeline is inherently safer. That is why we need to bring that crude oil by pipeline from Canada to the gulf coast. where our refining capacity is. The amendment would actually expand what is under current law. It would make it even harder. The goal of the legislation is to have this North American energy independence market. and we dont need to throw up more roadblocks to keep companies from importing or exporting to Canada or importing or exporting to Mexico. where we already have free trade agreements. I urge a ""no"" vote on the amendment."
1130104131,Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. and I thank him for working with me on H.R. 4007. I rise in support of H.R. 4007. the CFATS Authorization and Accountability Act. legislation I introduced with Congressman MEEHAN and my friend Chairman MCCAUL. This bipartisan legislation would. for the first time. codify the Chemical Facility AntiTerrorism Standards program that DHS has been operating through appropriations funding since Last October. during the government shutdown. the American people saw that without authorization of the CFATS program there would be no legal binding regulations in place to protect our Nations chemical facilities from criminal and terrorist attacks once the appropriations expired. I have the honor of representing north and east Harris County and the Houston Ship Channel. at the heart of our Nations petrochemical industry. The expiration of the CFATS program puts the safety of my constituents who work in and live in the communities that surround these facilities in danger. and it is our obligation as the peoples elected representatives to do everything we can to protect them from harms way. I have heard the concern of those on my side of the aisle who do not support this legislation. I agree that this is not perfect legislation. It does not solve every problem that exists in the CFATS program. but a number of Congresses since 2007 have had the opportunity to do this but we havent. The main purpose of this bill is to reauthorize CFATS for 3 years and give Congress the opportunity to oversee DHS progress or lack thereof. This bill will solve the personnel surety issue by allowing workers who have TWIC or HME cards to have access to chemical facilities without having to get another Federal credential. Representing those plants. I saw what happened with the TWIC card and the concern of folks who have to pay more money for another Federal ID card. This bill. if passed. would protect the folks who work in those plants. That is important to my constituents who already have TWIC cards and work in the petrochemical plants and drive the trucks that deliver the raw materials and products they produce. I urge my colleagues to join the Homeland Security Committee. which passed this legislation by voice vote. and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. who has been vocal in support of the legislation. and vote in support of H.R. 4007.
1130118230,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2. Here we are. the next day after we passed bipartisan legislation with a majority on both sides. and now today we come up with H.R. 2. which has a combination of bills that this House has already considered. And what. we are here the last day of voting. the day before we go home to campaign. passing a bill that has zero chance of becoming law. H.R. 2 is an affront to the bipartisan work we have done in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Over the past year. the members of our committee have worked together to craft legislation that would support the dramatic energy renaissance our country is experiencing. Unfortunately. H.R. 2 that we are considering today is not reflective of this hard work. some of the compromises we did. Instead of working to improve the decisionmaking made by Federal agencies. H.R. 2 seeks to eliminate Federal authority. Instead of expediting export permits. H.R. 2 opens the door to sending U.S. gas to countries that are not even our friends. Instead of respecting the balance we worked so hard to establish between the States and the Federal Government. H.R. 2 rescinds all the authority for our government in State affairs. It is my hope that we would stop wasting time on these bills that have no bipartisan support and work together to pass legislation in a bipartisan fashion. We actually have addressed a number of these bills already on this House floor. Everyone. Democrat or Republican. has acknowledged that the energy sector has common ground. We may not always agree on what fuel mix we have or how to best serve our country. but we can agree that the energy sector is vital to our economy and our independence. The bills included in H.R. 2 include bills I have cosponsored and worked hard to craft with my Republican and Democratic colleagues. It is disappointing that our leadership would use this window of opportunity to pass bills that harm our environment. create uncertainty in our economy. and ultimately delay job growth and energy development. In the Energy and Commerce Committee. we work across party lines to draft legislation that solves the problems of the American people and American industry. We work to ensure that the EPA. the Environmental Protection Agency. is promulgating rules that make not only economic sense. but. as well. environmental sense. We work to support our natural resources sector and send American gas and refined products overseas to benefit our U.S. economy and balance of trade. All of these things will garner bipartisan support and establish the U.S. and North America as the world energy leader. But this H.R. 2 takes away all that we have worked for for almost 2 years. and that is why I oppose H.R. 2.
1130124901,Mr. Speaker. I am not so sure about a noted Texas landmark. but I want to thank you for scheduling a Special Order for our good friend. RALPH HALL. I rise to pay tribute to a great American who has dedicated his life to protecting and serving our Nation and the great State of Texas. Representative RALPH HALL. a true gentleman. RALPH began his commitment to service seven decades ago when he joined the United States Navy and served as an aircraft carrier pilot during World War II. Returning to Texas after the war. RALPH began private law practice in Rockwall. Texas. where he served as county judge in the 1950s and represented that area in the Texas State Senate from 1962 to 1972. That is when I first met RALPH HALL. because in 1972 he ran for Lieutenant Governor in Texas in the Democratic primary. There were a few other folks in that race. so RALPH didnt make it into the runoff. But RALPH was elected to Congress in 1980 as a conservative Democrat. where he served our State honorably on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Science Committee. where he was chairman from 2011 to 2013. In 2003. RALPH became a Republican. His votes were always conservative. though. My job in the 1990s as a deputy whip on the Democratic side was to whip Texas Members. So I would go to RALPH. and he was the distinguished gentleman. And that is just not a title. he really was. He would tell me. he said: Well. GENE. what do you want me to do? I said: Well. RALPH. I want you to vote thisaway. He said: You know. GENE. I cant really do that. I said: Well. RALPH. can you vote late? RALPH was always a conservative. no matter what Republican or Democratic label he had. I had the honor of serving with RALPH in Congress since 1993 and on the Energy and Commerce Conmittee since 1997. and RALPH has always been. like I said. a true gentleman to me and to all I have ever seen him work with. I will best remember RALPH as a true hero of Texas who was a committed public servant. either in uniform or elected official. and always stayed true to his beliefs and did everything he could for his constituents. Mr. Speaker. Congressman HALL will be sorely missed by all of us. and I want to thank him for both his hard work and dedication for years. but more importantly for his friendship to a lot of Membersnot just Texans. but a lot of Members in Congress. RALPH will be very fondly remembered.
1130126163,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Senate amendments to H.R. 4007. the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act. I am an original cosponsor of this important legislation which will finally authorize the CFATS program in federal code and not through the appropriations process. Last October. during the government shutdown. the American people saw that without authorization of the CFATS program. there were no legally binding regulations in place to protect our nations chemical facilities from criminal and terrorist attacks once appropriations expired. I have the honor of representing north and east Harris County and the Houston Ship Channel. at the heart of our nations petrochemical industry. The expiration of the CFATS program puts the safety my constituents who work in and live in the communities that surround these facilities in danger and it is obligation. as the peoples elected representatives. to do everything we can to protect them from harms way. This measure passed the House in July by voice vote. I backed the Houseversion of this measure because the bill will solve the personnel surety issue by allowing workers who have TWIC or HME cards to have access to chemical facilities without having to get another federal credential. This is important to my constituents who already have TWIC cards and work in our petrochemical plants and drive the trucks to deliver raw materials and products they produce. I am supportive of some of the changes the Senate made to this legislation. In particular. I am supportive of measures that will add greater worker participation into plant security plans and provide greater whistleblower protections for plant employees who want to report unsafe conditions at a plant. I do have some concerns with allowing smaller facilities to selfcertify. as added in by the Senate. because even smaller facilities. as we have unfortunately seen in Texas in recent years. can be dangerous and the American people deserve full assurance that facilities near them are safe. Nonetheless. the underlining legislation is still sound and needs to be enacted. I urge my colleagues to join DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson. and impacted stakeholders and vote in support of the Senate amendments to H.R.

1140008818,Well. you can come down any time. The door is open. We are ready to show anyone. really. from this body. so that they can see firsthand what we are dealing with. I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois for his comments and his encouragement and his support to this bill in this initiative. We have got to find likeminded individuals to move this forward because that is what the American people are asking us to do. When we were hosting the CODEL down at the Ladd ranch. Jack Ladd and John Ladd. just amazing and wonderful Americans and hardworking people who gave us their perspective. along with many other ranchers. If you remember. one of the ranchers said: Look. these mules are just trafficking through our neighborhoods. but they are going to yours. Once they hit the highway and they are able to get around. they are moving on to Phoenix. they are moving over to California. they are moving up to Illinois. They are bringing their drugs to all over the United States. There is cartel presence in many of these States. This is a very sophisticated criminal organization. Even though it starts in my district. it is impacting everyone in the country. related to their presence in everybodys district. This is the time. We have been talking about border security for a very long time. and there have been efforts. With putting up some of the additional barriers. we have seen the efforts and how that has delayed activity. for sure. We have seen how the San Diego sector has really done a fantastic job in order to go from what was literally just an open border to having much better control. But this is a sophisticated organization. these cartels. and they adjust. What do they do? They adjusted into my sector. Even as we put up some barriers. it basically funneled them into these rural areas. so that these criminals were trafficking through the ranchers neighborhoods and border residences. Again. we were the highest sector since 1998 until last year. as far as the number of apprehensions. but as we said on the trip. we dont know what the denominator is. If all we are doing is measuring the numerator of how many individuals we have caught or apprehended. but the Border Patrol does not have situational awareness to be able to see all activity and then intercept the activity. we dont even know what those numbers are. We have got to have the political will now to address this very important issue. so that we can bring the promise home to the people who live in my community and then in the rest of the country. This is not hard. This is a good bill. In our sector. it provides additional resources. it provides additional technologies to increase the situational awareness. It holds Border Patrol and the senior appointees in Homeland Security accountable for securing the border. and it provides the resources and the capabilities that they need in order to gain situational awareness and operational control. I have heard many of our colleaguesand if you all want to join on this discussionsay. Just build a fence. just build a fence. Look. we have built some fences in southern Arizona. and those fences and those vehicle barriers and the pedestrian fences. they are delaying activity. for sure. What we have seen is these sophisticated cartels have got scouts on hilltops. they have got good communication devices. they have got incredible equipment. and they are across those fences. They either go over it. through it. or under it. and they do it in very fast time. A barrier is certainly one element of a strategy in order to slow down the activity. but that is not the only answer. It is very costly. about $5 million a mile for some of this fencing. so where it is appropriate. it definitely needs to be put up. But if we dont actually have Border Patrol actively monitoring where the fence line is. using intelligencedriven operations. and then intercepting the activity. patrolling right at the border on the south of John Ladds ranch. not on the north side. then we are still not going to be able to stop these breaches because they will happen. For those who dont understand that. I welcome them to come to Arizona and see that. I yield again to the gentleman from California . my colleague.
1140008823,Thank you. Mr. DAVIS. for your kind words and your support. I come from a very diverse district and a very split district. I won by 167 votes to get here. So we are a very diverse and split district. But I will tell you. this is a unifying issue. even in my district. When I look at the things that are going to unify us. it is making sure that we are safe and secure and have economic opportunity. Throughout my district. people agree we need to secure the border. Now. they also want to look for thoughtful solutions to modernize and revamp our legal immigration system so that those who want to come here to work and are going to contribute to our economy have a legal way to do that. We need to work on those challenges as well. As we talk about it in southern Arizona. we need a high fence and a wide gate. sort of metaphorically. What that means is. lets focus our border security on transnational criminal organizations and the public safety and national security threat. but we also need to make sure we have got good economic development and opportunities for individuals to come here legally. and also for commerce to be able to flow. which is a separate issue. They often get lumped in together and oftentimes these issues get hijacked by others who have other intentions that are trying to politicize it. But I think every AmericanDemocrat. Independent. Republicancan agree that they want their families to be safe and secure from transnational criminal organizations. I cant find anyone who doesnt agree to that. So why is this not an issue that would unify this body? Why is this not an issue that we could work together on within our party and then across to the other side of the aisle to actually get the job done. to use commonsense solutions. to give the situational awareness. the tools they need. to hold Homeland Security accountable. to secure our border once and for all. direct a better strategy sector by sector. to provide that situational awareness and operational control? I strongly support this bill. I appreciate the leadership of Chairman MCCAUL. my colleagues who have joined me here tonight. and others who have gotten behind this bill. And I want to urge those who are watching and listening to please call your Congressman. tell him to support the Secure Our Borders First Act. and lets get this thing through the House. through the Senate. and signed by the President. This is not time to play politics with border security. The residents and the ranchers in my community cannot wait any longer in order to have that fear go away so that they can feel like they can sleep well at night and their livelihood is not at stake and their families are not at risk. We owe it to them to take action. Lets figure out how to unify. work through any sort of solutions that we need to in order to get to a commonsense agreement. and lets pass this bill. Mr. Speaker. with that. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140037574,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. as the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Securitys Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications. I rise today in support of H.R. 2200. the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015. We know that terrorists have long strived to employ chemical. biological. radiological. and nuclearor CBRNmaterials in their attacks. ISIS and other terror organizations have attempted to use chemical weapons. and experts suggest that terrorist interest in utilizing chemical agents has increased. In fact. reports indicate that ISIS may be currently using chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq. Since the procedures and equipment required to develop biological weapons are the same as those used for legitimate research purposes and are readily available. it is imperative that intelligence information related to bio threats is appropriately analyzed and shared with those who would be on the front lines of response in the event of a biological attack. Furthermore. events such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 illustrated the need for better information sharing between Federal and local officials. H.R. 2200 will enhance intelligence analysis and information sharing to fill this need and will work to ensure that State and local officials get the actionable intelligence information necessary to stop or mitigate a CBRN attack. This legislation considers information garnered from the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications hearings on the threat of chemical and biological terrorism. During two hearings earlier this year. we heard from numerous stakeholders that information sharing with appropriate State and local officials and emergency response providers about these threats is critical. Specifically. this budget neutral bill requires the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS to support homeland security focused intelligence analysis of CBRN threats. including emerging infectious diseases. working in coordination with the Departments National Biosurveillance Integration Center and the intelligence community. As information and intelligence is only useful if it is shared with those who can take action. such as State. local. tribal. and private entities. H.R. 2200 directs the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to not only share information with these partners. but also engage with them and get their feedback on mechanisms for twoway sharing of information. Finally. H.R. 2200 directs the Secretary of DHS to report annually for 5 years on the Departments intelligence and information sharing activities to counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction and DHSs activities in accordance with relevant intelligence strategies. The House passed nearly identical bills during the 112th and 113th Congresses with bipartisan support. I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1140037587,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Securitys Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications. I rise today in support of H.R. 615. the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act. of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. This bill was introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey. the subcommittees ranking member. Mr. PAYNE. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include. among the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Securitys Under Secretary for Management. achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the Departments components. H.R. 615 addresses the findings and recommendations of a November 2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report. which stated that the Department does not have the appropriate oversight or governance structure to ensure communications interoperability among its components. It is vital that the Departments components are able to effectively communicate day to day and. most importantly. during emergencies. In response to the findings of this inspector generals report. I joined Chairman MCCAUL and Oversight and Management Efficiency Subcommittee Chairman PERRY in requesting a review of this issue by the Government Accountability Office. Their report. which was released in March. found that nearly 3 years after the inspector generals report. communications problems persist in the Department and among its components. In particular. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel reported to the GAO that the lack of interoperability in some cases along the border resulted in missed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety. My district is on the southwest border. I know the challenges our Border Patrol agents. CBP officers. and ICE agents face in meeting their vital missions. It is unacceptable that they lack the tools and training necessary to communicate with each other. This bill seeks to make this more of a priority at the headquarters level. In order to ensure the Department is taking the necessary steps to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities. H.R. 615 requires the Departments Under Secretary for Management to submit an interoperable communications strategy to the Committee on Homeland Security no later than 180 days after enactment and to periodically report to Congress on efforts to implement this strategy. This bill passed the House in February by a vote of 3790. I appreciate the swift action of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee under the leadership of my friend. Chairman JOHNSON. Their thoughtful additions have served to further improve this bill. I urge all Members to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140052609,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2786. the CrossBorder Rail Security Act of 2015. First. I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas . the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security. for introducing this thoughtful bill and working in a collaborative manner as this legislation moved through the committee process. Mr. Speaker. this legislation requires the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection to submit a report to Congress that outlines how and when highrisk rail shipments entering the United States are scanned for potential risks. The impetus for this legislation was a recent inspector general report that found CBP was inadequately targeting highrisk rail shipments arriving in the U.S. from Canada and Mexico. This bill will help Congress better understand the frequency and location of such highrisk shipments and detail the current state of radiation detection equipment on our international railways. Mr. Speaker. as many of my colleagues who also live along the border know. each year approximately 2.7 million containers enter the United States by rail. While most of the commodities transferred by rail do not pose significant homeland security threats. we must ensure that we are properly identifying and targeting those shipments which are high risk and conduct physical scanning when necessary. To ensure proper oversight. it is very important to understand the capabilities of CBP. including the number. location. and type of detection equipment used at each crossborder rail crossing. We also need to understand what additional equipment and training is necessary to ensure our rail cargo system is secure. As we know. proper training is an important force multiplier which will help maximize effectiveness of our Customs and Border Protection Officers. reducing wait times and increasing security. Finally. H.R. 2786 requires the Government Accountability Office to perform a series of audits over CBPs targeting of crossborder rail shipments. Mr. Speaker. rail cargo is expected to increase over the next 10 years. This bill will ensure CBP adequately addresses this vulnerability and implements proper standards of screening and targeting for rail cargo. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2786. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140061761,Mr. Speaker. I appreciate your leadership on this bill over this last year and that. also. of our colleagues. working hard to make sure this is a good bill that gives our troops everything they need to protect our country and keep it safe. I commanded troops in combat. I know what it is like to make sure that we were ready to deploy anywhere in the world. We need to make sure that our troops that are at home. on alert. or deployed in harms way have the equipment. the training. and the certainty that they need in order to keep us safe. Right now we have men and women who raised their right hand that are right now out there on the front lines putting their lives on the line. and the last thing they need is more uncertainty. The Presidents veto last week gives them uncertainty. and we need to stop that right now. today. We have been able to push past some of the issues with our colleagues. I urge everyone to support this very important bill. A couple of provisions just related to my district. We have got protections for the A10 and the EC130. very important assets that are deployed right now in the fight against ISIS and in other places around the world. saving American lives. This bill protects those assets from being retired. It is an important bill to pass to show certainty to our troops that we have got their backs. We also have missions down in Fort Huachuca in asymmetrical capabilities that are important for us and our defense. Whether it is unmanned aerial vehicles or cybersecurity. electronic jamming. we need to send the message to them that we are going to give them everything they need. Unlike Congressman SAM JOHNSON and his experience in Vietnam. we have got to show the troops that we have got their backs. This bill has important provisions in it across the board. including those for retirement benefits. sexual assault victims. It is a good bill. The President should not be playing politics with it. I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we need to work together. support this bipartisan bill. and get it passed. We need to make sure that our troops know we have their backs. We have their backs.
1140067428,Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Chairwoman MILLER for this thoughtful legislation. I rise today in support of H.R. 159. I was a proud member of the Committee on Homeland Securitys task force on combatting terrorists and foreign fighter travel. The task force bipartisan report. which was a culmination of 6 months of investigative activities. contained many troubling findings related to the ease with which foreign fighters from Visa Waiver Programparticipating countries could seek entry into the United States. Of the estimated 30.000 foreign fighters that we are aware of. at least 4.500 hold western passports. This is made even more alarming by the fact that 30 of the 38 Visa Waiver Programs are in Europe. I am pleased that this legislation that we are considering today takes steps to address many of the task forces findings related to this program. The bill prohibits individuals that travel to Iraq and Syria from using the program. It requires termination of a participating country for failing to screen against INTERPOLs criminal and terrorism databases. It authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to suspend participating countries when it is determined that they pose a high risk to the national security of the United States. ISIS has better resources and is more brutal and more organized than any terrorist organization to date. We must use all the tools at our disposal to defeat them. I am particularly pleased that this bill recognizes the need to continually update and secure the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. or ESTA. a key task force recommendation. As part of this effort. we must leverage new and innovative technologies. The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to explore opportunities to incorporate technology into ESTA that will detect deception and fraud. A number of promising deception detection technologies have been developed. including one developed at the University of Arizona in my district. Deception can be difficult to detect when you are interviewing an individual face to face. It is even more difficult to detect the deception in online forums like ESTA uses. The technology developed at the University of Arizona called NeuroScreen identifies typing. scrawling. and other computeruse patterns to capture motor nervous system signals associated with deceptive and suspicious behavior. We must leverage technology. such as NeuroScreen. to enhance screening programs like ESTA. Mr. Speaker. we all want to ensure that people from around the world can travel here to experience all the wonders and the freedoms of the United States. As we welcome travelers here. we must do so in a way that keeps us safe. That is why I support H.R. 1158. I urge all our Members to support this thoughtful bipartisan legislation.
1140072231,"Mr. Speaker. I rise to talk about a very special group of women who were mentors to me and who were pioneering heroes of our country. These women were the Women Airforce Service Pilots. the WASPs. Some people dont know that much about them. but here is a picture of them as they flew airplanes in the World War II era. When we needed everybody to serve in whatever capacity one could in our country. they needed women to step up and become pilots in order to do all sorts of different missions. like towing targets for the gunners on the ground to learn how to shoot things down. like training men to go on to fly in combat. like ferrying airplanes all over the theaters to deliver them where they needed to be in the combat zone and bringing them back for maintenance. They were test pilots and engineers. You name it. These women were asked to step up and serve. They went through training. They put on the uniform. They lived in the barracks. They learned how to march. They were pioneers for women like me. who later on served as aviators in the military. There are just a little over 1.000 of these amazing women who served in World War II. They werent given ActiveDuty status. although that was the intent of General Arnold when they set up this program. If you think back then. the thought of having women military pilots was a little bit of a cultural hangup. We will let women be Rosie the Riveter. and we will let women serve in support positions. But pilots? Now. that is kind of crazy talk. So they had a little bit of a problem culturally. but they didnt care. They chose to serve anyway. They said. ""I am going to step up and serve my country. I am going to do that as a pilot. I am going to do this with honor and with valor."" just like their male counterparts did in these very same missions before them. alongside them. and then after them. Thirtyeight of them died in training or in conducting missions. Thirtyeight of them paid the ultimate sacrifice. They werent even given veterans benefits or any benefits after perishing in the line of duty. but they still continued to serve because their country needed them. It was not until 1977 that they were actually given veteran status after the fact. They were then given honorable discharges. They were given the medals that their male counterparts got for serving as Active Duty in the military. They were allowed to be buried. with honors. in veterans cemeteries across the country and were given full military honors. which they deserved. They were actually allowed. as they should be allowed. to be in Arlington National Cemetery. alongside other heroes who have gone before them. Yet. we just found out within the last few weeks that that has been rescinded by the Department of Army. That happened quietly back in March of 2015 to these heroes. who deserve to be recognized and who deserve to be a legacy in Arlington National Cemetery so that future generations will know what they did and will know of the doors that they opened in the way that they served. It was rescinded by the Army. We didnt know about this until Elaine Harmon. one of the WASPs. passed away. I saw her handwritten will when I me with her family last week. It reads. ""I desire to be in Arlington National Cemetery. I want my ashes there."" Her family put in the request like everybody else does. and they were denied. We now found out that the Army has rescinded that and that it is no longer allowing these pioneering women to be laid to rest in Arlington. Elaine Harmons ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet in her granddaughters home. awaiting her final resting place in Arlington. which she deserves. The Army gave us some bureaucratic answer about. oh. they are running out of space. and. by mistake. they opened it up. In 2002. they actually allowed women to be in Arlington. Only two women took advantage of this and asked to be. in their own right. in Arlington. Then the Army turned around and rescinded it. Again. they gave some bureaucratic answer. They are on the wrong side of this. We have looked into all of the legalities. The Army has all of the authorities that they need to allow these heroes to be laid to rest in Arlington. but they are choosing not to do so. We have introduced legislation. We are going to make sure that it happens. but we are calling on them to actually change it tonight. Right now. the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of Defense or the President could tonight say: Do you know what? Elaine Harmon and the other WASPsthere are only a little over 100 who are still livingare going to be allowed to have their ashes in Arlington National Cemetery alongside other heroes. This is the least they could do. and they could do it tonight. So I am leading the Special Order tonight. This is a bipartisan Special Order. This is bipartisan legislation. and it is bicameral. When we raised awareness of this issue and got the legislation together. we had nearly 80 sponsors right away on this bill who said: Lets change this thing. Today the Senate introduced a similar bill. and we are going to work together to get this thing done. We want to continue to raise awareness to this issue. this egregious violation of these women. We want this thing changed now. It takes a little bit of time sometimes around here to work through legislation. In the meantime. Elaine Harmons ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet. That is not the way we treat our heroes. That is not the way we treat our pioneers who paved the way for military aviators. like me. to be able to serve in the way we did. and it needs to be changed tonight. We have a number of individuals here on both sides of the aisle who are going to be sharing this time with me tonight. I first yield to my good friend and colleague. the gentlewoman from California . who is the lead Democratic cosponsor of this bill."
1140084960,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today. we are considering a critical piece of legislation that would require the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a full assessment of the threats that are coming across our southern border. Evaluating our border threats regularly seems like common sense. especially given the everevolving nature of cartel and smuggling activity. yet DHS has not conducted a systematic threat assessment of our southern border in over 20 years. A lot has changed since then. Southern Arizonans know well that our border is not secure. Transnational criminal organizations are trafficking drugs. money. people. and weapons into and through our communities. This poses a significant public safety risk and national security threat. For my constituents. this is not just an abstract issue but is something that is a part of their everyday lives. The brave men and women of the Border Patrol do all they can with the tools they are provided. but they are restricted by outdated strategies and political leadership that does not have the resolve to let agents do what they do bestsecure the border. In addition. not only is our strategy based off of outdated information. but the metrics used to measure that strategy are inconsistent and incomplete. The last time DHS measured security along the border. which was in 2010. a mere 44 percent of it was under operational control. Recently. DHS claimed they have been over 80 percent effective along the border. yet the best analytical research. using all available data. puts the true probability of apprehension much closer to 50 percent. Likewise. a month ago. in a hearing I led as the chairwoman of the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee. the Border Patrol confirmed they have only a little over 50 percent situational awareness of the border. That means. of illicit activity coming across our. roughly. 2.000mile southern border. we only know of a little over half of it. We will never secure the border unless we have a full awareness of where we are getting beat by the cartels. The first step to fixing something is actually understanding the problem. My bill requires a full assessment of the threats along our southern border. including where we have vulnerabilities. where we can better leverage technology. and what percentage of situational awareness and operational control we have. Once we understand and identify the gaps in our defenses. then we can develop a better plan to address those shortfalls through a change of strategy that modifies how we deploy agents. technology. and infrastructure. That is why my bill also requires the U.S. Border Patrol to design a new strategic plan that is based on a new threat analysis required by this bill. Mr. Speaker. there is always a lot of talk about securing the border here in Washington. D.C. It is time to actually take some action. This bill is a critical first step in building trust in our system and in our ability to accurately measure illicit activity along the border and respond to it. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.

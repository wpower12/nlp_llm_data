1130011653,Mr. Speaker. rise today to address a matter of great concern not only for my congressional district. but for the future of science research in the United States. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT. has been a leader in fusion energy research for decades. and I would like to clarify congressional intent regarding the continued operations of its Alcator CMod fusion energy experiment. While the Presidents Fiscal Year 2013 budget request contained a substantial increase for the international fusion energy project ITER. based in France. it dramatically reduced domestic fusion energy funding as a tradeoff. As part of this effort. the Presidents request would schedule the Alcator CMod tokamak for closure. I want to be clear: at no point in the appropriations process has Congress approved of or authorized this closure. The Continuing Resolution before us today. H.R. 933. directs the Department of Energy. DOE. to continue virtually all policy and funding provisions included in currently enacted appropriations legislation for FY 2012 for DOE. including its Office of Science. The Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee has previously expressed profound concern regarding the need to maintain a balance between domestic and international funding in the Department of Energys Office of Fusion Energy Sciences. as well as the need to maintain the US fusion talent base and leadership. Although the Presidents budget for FY 2013 proposed a major shift in funding from domestic fusion programs. including for the CMod fusion facility. neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations Committee approved those changes. It is my understanding that it is the intention of the Appropriations Committee that funding for all major domestic magnetic fusion activities should be continued under H.R. 933. just as they were in FY 2012. Under this Continuing Resolution. the Office of Science should neither start nor stop programs. subprograms. or activities. including those within the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences. In MITs case. this means that over the course of FY 2013. the Department should provide sufficient funds for operations and research for CMod and other domestic fusion facilities consistent with FY 2012 levels. minus sequestration. MITs emphasis on American innovation in fusion energy and the training of our next generation of fusion energy scientists is vital to the overall success of our Nations program. Congress has not approved a closure of the Alcator CMod tokamak. and its continued operation through FY 2013 is provided for in H.R. 933.
1130053982,"For the first time in my life. I have no intention of being as passionate as the gentleman from New Jersey. and I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. I was going to walk people through this because to me. good people can disagree. Reasonable people can disagree. Even people I disagree with vehemently. thats what politics. thats what government. thats what life is all about. But youre not entitled to forget history or to ignore facts. And for me. there have been lots of misrepresentations in the last week or two because theres a lot of passion. a lot of emotion. But I need to back up a little bit. educational value. When Im told that the Democrats have to come to the table and compromise. my answer is: We have. repeatedly. And we will do it again. if necessary. And people say. Well. no. you havent. The President is saying no. you wont negotiate. Well. no. we wont negotiate on this issue at this point in time because we have already gone far enough. and heres why. 2011. the last supercommittee. where did it come from? It came from the budget impasse. We couldnt come to an agreement. We couldnt make a deal. We had taken our corners. What did we do? We created a supercommittee and it was said if the supercommittee doesnt work. do something like SimpsonBowles or whatever they would come up with. then we would institute a sequester. And a sequester. for all intents and purposes. is an acrosstheboard cut of roughly 8 percent per year every year for 10 years in a row. Thats what it is. At the end of that 10th year if you dont do anything. you would be spending approximately 48 cents of every dollar you were spending when you started. Now I understand that some people want a government that does that and the programs that would pay for. I dont agree with that. but thats a reasonable position to take. ""I dont want senior housing. I dont want childhood nutrition."" I dont agree with it. but its a reasonable position to take. and we should argue about that and we should debate about that. and the American people should have an opportunity to elect people that agree or disagree with them on those types of issues. We couldnt come to an agreement. so the sequester took place. and the sequester set out numbers each year for 10 years. This is as much as you can spend unless you come up with some sort of agreement to get around it. We havent been able to do it. Weve had the first year of sequester and are about to enter the second year of sequester. Pursuant to the law that was passed in 2011. a law. by the way. I voted againstI dont like the concept of sequesterbut the majority ruled and it passed. Pursuant to that law in this coming fiscal year. we would have been allowed to spend a little over a trillion dollars. Remember. that number is based on an 8 percent cut from the prior year. So this already represents a cut. and. by the way. it represents a massive compromise between Democrats and Republicans to pass that sequester. So it was a Democratic compromise with Republicans to cut the budget for 10 years in a row. Thats where we start. This year. Republicans passed a budget of $967 billion. $100 billion below what the sequester allows. Theyre entitled to do that. Again. I can disagree. but I respect their viewpoint. If you really think the government can operate and provide the services the American people want on that number. fine. I will disagree. we will vote. pass it. and well move on. Of course. the Senate didnt agree with that number. The Senate passed another number. Here we are today. Whats happened? The last week or so. you have heard pretty much every Democrat. pretty much every Democrat say we want to vote on the clean CR. the continuing resolution. that the Senate passed. The average American has no clue what were talking about. Heres what they passed. They passed a budget that would allow the spending of $986 billion. To me. if youre going to talk about a compromisesequester allows a little over a trillion. Republicans want $967 billion. The compromise is here. a little over a trillion dollars. That would be a compromise on a compromise. But. no. the Senate says not $986 billion. Thats a compromise on a compromise on a compromise. What did the Republican House leaders say? No. $967 billion. our number. By the way. no health care. For those of you who thought Democrats havent been compromising. Im here to tell you. in my opinion. not only have we compromised. I think we have compromised too much from my philosophical viewpoint. I know that Im the minority view in this House. So be it. I think the sequester was too much. I certainly think $967 billion is too much. and I think $986 billion is too much. You know why? My constituents want senior housing. they want children fed. they want young people educated. and on and on and on. They want veterans benefits. They want all the things that we do. Of course no one wants to pay for that. I get that. I dont either. I pay taxes. I wish everything was free. Im going out to dinner in a little while. hopefully to watch the Red Sox win the series. and I dont want to pay for dinner. but I guess Ill have to. Reasonable differences of opinion. no matter how dramatic they may be. a $100 billion difference. are realistic. theyre honest. and the American people have a right to take sides. They dont have a right to say Democrats havent compromised. This was a compromise. This would have been a compromise. This is a compromise. This is not. This is uncompromising. Thats why I wanted to come up here. By the way. theres one little point of historic note. Ive been in the House 141/2 years. This is my first Special Order. And. as I said. I probably missed the first inning of the Red Sox game. which in my district is close to a cardinal sin. But this is more important. Im not trying to convince anyone that my side is right or the other side is wrong. People have their opinions. I know that. Youre probably not going to change them. I am here to say that there is a difference between compromise and capitulation. We have compromised one. two. three times to get where we are. To get to this number would be the fourth. To get rid of health care would be fifth. and not just fifth. it would be the ending. As far as Im concerned. this Democrat will not compromise further on these issues. Its time for the other side to compromise off of what they think the world should be. Thank you for yielding. Mr."
1130063068,"Thank you. Mr. PASCRELL. Barry. I wanted to save this until last because. honestly. stuff about life is just stuff. It is all interesting. You have had an interesting life. Great. For me. I wanted to do this because I consider you a friend. and I dont make friends that easily. I make a lot of acquaintances. I dont consider a lot of people close friends. To me. friendship is based on whether I think somebody will go through the fire for me like I would go through the fire for them. My judgment on you is that you would. It has a lot to do with the way you were raised. I dont know much about it. but I do. When you were raised in South Boston. I was being raised in Somerville. There was only one place in the world tougher than South Boston at that time. and that was Somerville. I will tell you that an awful lot of people come out of those situations bitter. with a lot of difficulties. not knowing what to do and angry at the world. A lot of good people come out of it. though. just the oppositeunderstanding. okay. life can be tough. life isnt fair. make the best of it you can. It is better to go through life with a smile and take yourself a little less seriously than it is to be bitter. You have done that. You have done it with grace. To me. that means an awful lot. I will tell you that it was always comforting for me to hear the voice on the machine. I think it is a joke. I think it is hilarious. I have actually enjoyed having to catch you up on your proper pronunciation of words. I love the fact that your friends at home called you and told you that the word ""speaker"" isnt spoken the way you have got it. It has been twisted after all of these years. You have got to get it right. Get back up to Boston. and get it straight. I think that is great. I will tell you that. for me. the relationship started before I even knew it. and that was at St. Johns Prep. You are the only person I know who went there besides me. The only difference between you and me is you finished it. and I got kicked out. but in those daysand I have no idea. I never asked why you were there. I know why I was there. I was there to be plucked out of a difficult situation with the hope that things would go a different way. Now. of course. you couldnt take the Somerville out of me. and it didnt quite work out the way my parents had thought it might. The Xaverian brothers mostly were from Somerville at the time. and their beatings were nothing to mejust natural life. But. to me. that tells me somethingyou had it right from the beginning. You had a good upbringing. You treat people with respect. You understand the needs of the Members here. and you treat us like human beings. To me. that is more important than anything else. For me. that friendship doesnt go away. I hate the fact that you are retiring. I hate it. I hate it because I dont take change too well. I like certain. stable things in my life. I love STEPHEN LYNCH. but I hate the fact that Joe Moakley is not with us anymore. I know that life changes. and I know and I hope to God that you have a great retirement. I hope you enjoy yourself. I hope you learn to say your wifes name properly. My wife is also a ""Barbara."" and there are no ""ahs"" in there. You dont need that letter. It is an extra letter. Just get rid of it. I hope you have a great retirement. I hope you realize that you are always. always. always going to have friends here. I dont care where I am or where you are. If there is ever anything I can do to help you or your family or if there is anything I can do to ever helpI dont even have to say it because I know you know it. It is what we do. It is what we enjoy doing. You are my friend. I dont come to this well very often. as you well know. It is a unique experience for me. I think most of what is said here is insincere and read off papers. I just wanted to take a minute to sincerely tell you that I have enjoyed our relationship. I consider you a good friend. and I wish you the best of life wherever you go. whatever you do. It has been a joy working with you. and I am proud of the fact that I can call you a friend. Thank you for your service. Barry. Thank you for your friendship. With that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130084382,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I was sitting back in my office trying to get some desk work done and watching this debate. I had no intention of speaking. but I have just heard these arguments so many times. and they are tiring. to be perfectly honest. So I did a little bit of work and came up with a couple of quotes I wanted to read. This is relating to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. which I have heard referenced on the other side. that talked about a 44hour workweek and minimum wage at the time. Here are a couple of quotes. The act will destroy small industry ... these ideas are the product of those whose thinking is rooted in an alien philosophy and who are bent upon the destruction of our whole constitutional system and the setting up of a redlabor communist despotism upon the ruins of our Christian civilization. That is a quote from Representative Cox of Georgia. The Fair Labor Standards Acts constitutes a step in the direction of communism. bolshevism. fascism. and nazism. That is a quote from the National Association of Manufacturers. The Fair Labor Standards Act would create chaos in business never yet known to us ... no decent American citizen can take exception to this attitude. What I do take exception to is any approach to a solution of this problem which is utterly impractical and in operation would be much more destructive than constructive to the very purposes which it is designed to serve. That was from Representative Lamneck of Ohio. These arguments are not new. When are you going to get tired of being behind history? When are you going to get tired of holding the American people back? Please find an opportunity at any casehealth care. housing. education. minimum wage. anythingto move us forward. We have 80 yearsplus of the same arguments against the typical legislation that simply tries to move America forward and take care of our people. It is the same old argument. the same old rhetoric. It was wrong then. and it is wrong now.
1130087612,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I am one of those three people who voted ""no."" I do not expect to win here today on the floor. And I want to be real clear: I do not oppose consolidated loan obligations. I support them. They are an important financial tool. But that is not what this bill does. This bill allows risky CLOs. Most CLOs would be permitted pursuant to the Volcker Rule. If they only contained loans. they are okay. Any bank can own them to any degree. So lets not think that somehow the Volcker Rule has killed CLOs. They have simply said they have to be what they say they are. collateralized loan obligations. not collateralized loan obligations put together with all kinds of other junk. Simple. Straightforward. There is not going to be any fire sale. The regulators have already listened to the congressional comments. of which I was one. asking for a delay to allow the existing CLOs that do not meet the regulation to be held for 2 more years. There will be no fire sale. There has been no fire sale. As we speak. the sale of CLOs is at a historic high. The Volcker Rule has not killed the market. They are back to almost the same levels they were at in 2007 before the crash. Let me be clear. I agree that CLOs did not. on their own. participate in the 08 problems and that they do have a record of success. But prior to 2008. most people would have said the same thing about collateralized debt obligations. By the way. at some point. somebody has to explain to me the difference between debt and loans. but that is a different issue. Collateralized loan obligations are important. They are a good. thoughtful way to provide capital. By the way. most of them are used for leveraged buyouts. as the example we just heard. for leveraged buyouts. Now. you can argue whether leveraged buyouts to the extent they happen are good or bad. but that is what they are mostly used for. I also want to be real clear. Very. very. very few small. community banks have any CLOs. Over 70 percent of the collateralized loan obligations. both the ones that are allowed and disallowed. are owned by three banks. Over 70 percent are owned by three of the largest banks in the world. And by the way. almost all of those CLOs would be permitted to those three large banks. So what are we solving here? We are pretending to save some great investment tool. It is not under threat. We are pretending that no problems could ever happen. Those are the same discussions we had in 05. 06. 07. and 08. All the risk that was being assumed comfortably and successfully prior to 2008 was perfectly fine. Those regulators are just killing Americauntil the crash happened. from which we are still recovering. All we want to do is take a look at some of the riskier aspects of this financial aspect and simply say. whoa. it doesnt mean everybody cant do it. It simply means regulated banks cant do it. Private investors could still do every one of these things. Why would regulated banks be prohibited from doing only the most risky CLOs? Because they are protected by taxpayer dollars. because they are protected by the FDIC. and because we. as a society. have said that bank stability is important to the American economy. So lets be clear: CLOs are not being killed. They are being limited in a very small way only to target the most risky CLOs. Banks and others have already adjusted to those limitations by reinvigorating the CLO market in a way that has been and would be allowed under the existing rule. But yet we have a problem. We have a crisis that we have to solve. A handful of people will not be allowed to risk my mothers investment. That is what we are crying about. Well. I have heard that before. and it didnt turn out too well in 08. A little limitation is good for the American system. And. by the way. it is historically the system as it has been for a thousand years. I just want to end with a quote by Paul Volcker himself. I presume Paul Volcker knows more about the economy and the markets than most people in Congress. But maybe not. Maybe some people are smarter than him. This is what he said about this bill: This constant effort to get around the rule limiting banks investment in hedge funds on behalf of a few institutions who apparently want room to resume the financing practices that got us into trouble in the past really should end. CLOsstraightforward and plain vanillaare a good and important investment tool for the American economy. They should and will be allowed under the current rules. There should and will be time for people to move slowly and thoughtfully without a fire sale out of the handful of risky investments that are there. and even those people who love those risky investments will be able to do it still. just not through a subsidized bank. I know that I have not convinced anyone. I know that I am going to lose this vote on the floor. and I respect it. And I hope to God that my concerns are wrong and overblown. I hope that in a few years I come back and I apologize to the gentleman for my concerns. that they were overblown and unjustified. Because America will be better off if you are right. But if you are wrong. a handful of people will make a lot of money. but the rest of us will be dramatically and deeply hurt once again."
1130092438,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to thank Ms. GRANGER in particular for bringing this bill forward. I was proud to be a small part in supporting this and trying to help push it forward. I am glad we are here today. I want to be real clear. A lot of people think of war as nothing more than destruction. which that is the main function is to destroy your enemy. They dont think sometimes what it is all about. particularly in the case of World War II. In the case of World War II. it was about a way of life. It was about a whole set of societal values. One set valued art and culture. even the art and culture we may not understand. I am not understanding of many of the fine works of art. but I appreciate how difficult they are. and I appreciate others appreciating. In a war. it would be the easiest thing in the world to simply destroy everything. steal everything. and just move forward. In this particular case. the United States of America took the lead. but we werent alone. The Monuments Men was made up of people from 13 different countries simply trying to preserve a piece of our culture. our shared culture. The Monuments Men was not made up of warriors. yet they became warriors. They were made up of artists. they were made up of museum directors. they were made up of curatorspeople who had been taught the value and understood the value of fine art. They went to war to protect and preserve it. because without that continuing link of culture. you would have to ask: Wouldnt we be a little less than who we are today? Their memory today is very important. particularly those who still survive. The mention has already been made about how many pieces of art5 million pieces of art. They werent just pictures on a wall. They were also figurines. There were religious artifacts. across the board. Five million pieces protected. kept for future generations. recovered from people who would otherwise steal them for their own personal use. probably would have destroyed them when they saw the end of their own culture. I want to speak today of the one American who served in what I think is a pretty typical story of who these people were. The one American who was killed in action in this particular unit. his name was Walter Huchthausen. He was born in Perry. Oklahoma. educated at the University of Minnesota and Harvard University. where he earned a masters degree in architecture in 1930. He wasnt ROTC. He wasnt militarily trained. He was an instructor at RPI in Troy. New York. and then director of the department of design at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Boston. in my own district. from 1935 to 1939. Then he went to the faculty at the University of Minnesota until he enlisted in 1942not got drafted. enlistedyes. to protect America. but also to take his special expertise. to do something special in a difficult situation. He was killed in action when he was caught in a firefight. As usual. in many military actions. it wasnt supposed to happen then and there. I think that tells you something about who these people were. They were there trying to help the next generation and generations to come maintain that line of connection. and they did it. For that. they deserve this honor. they deserve our undying gratitude. With that. I want to add my thanks for their actions. my thanks to Representative GRANGER for allowing us do this. and I yield back the balance of my time.
1130092446,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. To be perfectly honest. I am shocked that Congress hasnt already done thisabsolutely shocked. This should have been done in 1943. The Doolittle Raid was the most important military event of its time. For those of you who dont understand it. right after Pearl Harbor. being attacked. at the time. by the strongest military in the world at the top of their game. they did catch us by surprise and destroyed our Pacific fleet. We were sitting back trying to regroup. trying to get it going. trying to get troops going. How do we hit back? How do we prove that we can do this? The Doolittle Raid was all about that. As you heard. a previous speaker said ""volunteers."" Now. they were professional military. but they volunteered for this mission. Why were they asked to volunteer? Because everyone saw this as a death sentence. Nobody really thought they would ever come back. Why? Because the planes they flew were bombers. heavy bombers for those dayssmall compared to what we have todayflying off of aircraft carriers that. again. in todays Navy wouldnt be anything. Small aircraft carriers. No one had ever taken a bomber off of an aircraft carrier prior to this raid. No one had ever done it. No one thought it could be done. They got within a certain mileage of Japan beyond where they were supposed to go. They were told bomb Japan. land in China. Not enough fuel to get back. Any mission. like anything else. especially in days before good navigational tools. a lot of fuel was burned that wasnt planned on. None of them made it to their fields. Most of them crashlanded. As you heard. several of them died. That raid took all of America and lifted our spirits. Well documented. That is why I am shocked that we are here today. Well documented. It took the entire country and made us feel like. we can do this. we can do it now. even when we are unprepared. If we can do this now. imagine what we can do when we get prepared. The Doolittle Raid gave us the courage and the commitment to win that war. Those men were true heroes in every sense of the word. The fact that we are here today is an honor for me. but honestly. I think it is something that is well long overdue. For those who are still living. I want to add my thanks to their bravery. Without them. I think it would have been a much longer war and a much more disheartening year or so before we really engaged in a military action that we could win. With that. I thank the sponsor of this legislation. and I reserve the balance of my time."

1130005593,"We know from polling that most Americans have no idea what ""sequester"" means at all. In fact. one of our colleagues said that she was talking to a constituent who said. Yes. I am all for sequester. Lets sequester all the Members of Congress in a room and make sure that they come up with a plan. Thats not exactly the idea. ""Sequester."" which most Americans dont know the definition of. actually means that for domestic discretionary spendingthe things that help ordinary people and communities and law enforcementthere will be about a 9 percent acrosstheboard cut. just a meatax approach. You cant even decide between cutting conferences or leave in the research into cancer at the National Institutes of Health. No. everything is going to be across the board. a real meatax approach. There will also be about a 13 percent acrosstheboard cut in military spending. Thats what were talking about. And if people arent following exactly what the definition is. theyre going to soon find out what it means in their ordinary life. In education. were going to see cuts that are going to require the firing of teachers. About 70.000 little children are not going to be able to have their Head Start programs. Small businesses are going to find that almost $900 million will be unavailable to them in loans for their small businesses. Were going to lose about 2.100 food safety inspectors. How will it feel if we dont know for sure if were going to have safe food available? And weve all been talking about the need for more mental health services around this whole issue of gun violence. yet its predicted that about 373.000 adults and children who need mental health services wont find them available. Military readiness will be affected. We got some data on every State. In my State of Illinois. approximately 14.000 civil Department of Defense employees are going to be furloughed under the sequester. and that means reducing the gross pay that comes to them. citizens of Illinois. by $83.5 million. Thats money that they wont be able to spend in our economy. Base operation funding for Army bases will be cut about $19 million in Illinois. and funding for Air Force operations will be cut by about $7 million. These are real cuts in military readiness. Vaccines for children. Does anybody really think that the way to save on our budget is to cut the availability of vaccines for little children? And does anybody really think that the burden of cutting the deficit should be on the backs of senior citizens? The median income for people over 65 years old is $22.000 a year. The average Social Security benefit is $15.000 a year and provides most of the income for most of the seniors in this country. Does anybody think there isnt one tax loophole that can be closed. not one more penny that can come from huge and profitable corporations that often pay no taxes? We have some of those huge corporations paying no taxes. outsourcing jobs. setting up their corporate headquarters in post office boxes in the Cayman Islands. Some of them are getting. actually. tax breaks. refunds from the government. Multimillionaires and billionaires cant pay a penny more. but we can cut the National Institutes of Health and research for finding cancer cures. that new drug approvals ought to be cut. that we ought to cut veterans services. that people ought to just wait longer at airports. We should even shut down some airports because were going to have to furlough the air traffic controllers. that we should cut Meals on Wheels for senior citizens. that thats really the preferable way to go. I have to tell you this is just a crazy way to do business in the United States Congress. particularly since we have sensible alternatives. We have not seen one bill from the Republican side of the aisle that says. Heres our idea instead of these meatax cuts that are going to hurt people. and the Democrats have several bills we should be hearing on this floor."
1130025759,"Madam Chair. I rise today to express my strong support for funding veterans programs. However. I am very concerned that this bill is part of a Republican budget that would shortchange other critical prioritieslike education. nutrition and housing assistance. healthcare and medical research. I voted in favor of H.R. 2216. the Military ConstructionVA Appropriations bill for FY 2014 because I believe it is critical that we keep our promises to our veterans. Todays legislation provides $157.8 billion for veterans programs and military construction in FY 2014. including the over $73 billion in advance appropriations for veterans health care approved in last years appropriations measure. It also contains $55.6 billion in advance FY 2015 funding for VA medical programs. Among other critical priorities. it provides over $290 million to help the VA eliminate the disability claims backlog by 2015. including funding for the VAs paperless process claims system. It provides $344 million for the Pentagon and the VA to implement a joint integrated electronic health records system. These funds are critical: the VA has nearly 900.100 Pending disability claims and. of those. 72 percent have been pending for over 125 days. That is unacceptable. the backlog is causing serious hardships for veterans and families throughout our country. and it is imperative that we work with the VA to ensure that the backlog is eliminated and all claims are processed in a fair and timely manner. While I am proud to support critical funding for those who served our nation. I have serious concerns about the implications this bill carries for the rest of the appropriations process. The Republican Budget sets the lowest cap on discretionary spending in a decade. Nondefense discretionary spending would be reduced even below the levels required under the sequester. Because of those limits. the adequate funding of this bill will result in inadequate funding of other spending bills down the line. Those other bills fund national priorities including education. nutrition and housing assistance. and programs to spur job growth. We cannot afford to abandon those important initiatives. The White House warned. in its veto threat for this legislation. that enacting this bill ""while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House Budgets top line discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014. would hurt our economy and require draconian cuts to middleclass priorities."" I couldnt agree more. We need to set a realistic spending ceiling so that all of our national priorities receive adequate funding."
1130045426,"Thank you. Representative POCAN. for leading us in this Special Order that really talks about so many Americans who are paid poverty wages. people who simply cannot afford to support themselves or their families on the kinds of wages that they are paid. and the role of the Progressive Caucus in helping them to highlight that. So. on August 29. I was proud at 7 in the morning to arrive at the RocknRoll McDonalds in downtown Chicago. Its one of the most profitable McDonalds. certainly. in our area. I saw a growing crowd of people wearing Tshirts. saying. Strike for 15. and signs that said. We are worth more. In Illinois. the minimum wage is $8.25. so some of them were chanting. We cant survive on $8.25. and they were engaged in this 1day strike. the demand being $15 an hour and the right to join a union. to form a union. $15 an hour to work at McDonalds? If you were to work at McDonalds for 40 hours a week. 52 weeks a yearand of course the average employee there works about 24 hours a weekyou would at minimum wage make the lavish salary of $31.000 a year. which starts heading you toward the middle class. but its certainly not a huge salary. Compare that with the CEO of McDonalds. a man named Donald Thompson. whose pay package last year in 2012 was $13.7 million for the year. If you divide that out. he makes an hourly wage of $6.611. and he earns more in the first 2 hours of work on the first day of the year than the workers I was standing with make all year long. Now. these werent kids. I was out there with some people who have worked at McDonalds for 10 years. 15 years. One gentleman was still making $8.50 an hour. He had climbed up from the minimum wage to $8.50 an hour. Unless you think that McDonalds isnt thinking about its workers. they actually put out a book. a little book. in conjunction with Visa. called ""Practical Money Skills."" which is going to help their workers figure out how to budget. They have a budget that lists income from a workers first job and his second job. admitting that you certainly cant plan to work at McDonalds and live on that. so you have to have a second jobso the first job and second joball totaling $2.060 for the month. Then they have recommended monthly expenses to help their workers budget. including $600 a month for housing. Now. I dont know about Madison. Wisconsin. or anywhere else. but in Chicago. unless you live with somebodyor with maybe a couple of somebodies$600 a month for two jobs and budgeting that way is not going to get you a decent place to live. Remarkably. they budget $20 per month for health insurance. and that exists only in some sort of fantasy world. These are workers who often turn to government assistance just to make ends meet. These are the people who have often been demonized by our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle for going for SNAP programs. maybe for housing assistance. for Medicaid. Lots of wealthy Americans and even some of our colleagues suggest we ought to test them for drug use or accuse them of being lazy. but I posit today that the real welfare kings are those fastfood giants and all those povertywage employers who refuse to pay a livable wage. a living wage. We. the taxpayersall the rest of the taxpayerssubsidize them because they dont pay a living wage. so their employees. who are often working their tails off. often have to come to the government for help. I would argue that its the Walmarts and the McDonalds that really depend on these welfare programs and that. if you want to divide the world into takers and makers. those companies and those CEOs are the real takers. If I have time. I want to give a couple more facts. This hasnt always been true in America. these poverty wages. Between 1948 and 1973. the productivity of U.S. workers rose 96.8 percent. and wages rose 93.7 percent. They went up together. Workers benefited from increases in productivity. and thats true of the wages of the managers and bosses and CEOs as well. Wages went up. Between 1973 and 2011. productivity rose 80.1 percent. but wages rose only 4.2 percent. So you saw that. even though productivity went up. wages stayed essentially flat. Median household income today. adjusted for inflation. is at 1989 levels. and its not coincidental that during that same time union membership dropped from about onethird of the private sector workforce to about 6.5 percent today. nor is it coincidental that almost all the growth in incomeand. yes. we are richer today per capita than ever before. We are at the richest point in our country. but that growth in income has gone. really. especially to the top .1 percent. to the very richest Americans. All of that growth in income has gone to the top. So I think this is not just bad for the workers that we were out with this summer. This is really bad for our economy. If we want to have a robust middle class. where people can go out and buy things and create demand and. thus. create jobs. they would be the real makers. They would be the people who could revive our economy. I think that the essentials here are a living wage and the rights of workers to be able to collectively bargain so that they can defend themselves together. represent themselves together and get a decent middle class life in this richest country in the world. which is at its very richest stage right now."
1130046607,"Mr. Speaker. I think each one of us 435 has to ask ourselves. Is this really what we were sent here to do. to take food out of the mouths of hungry people. nearly half of them children? Thats whats at stake this week when we are asked to vote on legislation that would cut $39 billion from one of our Nations most successful and important programs. the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. SNAP. It used to be called food stamps. As a Jew. we just came through the Jewish holidays. and we talked about what it means to be a human being in this world. in this country. Every major religion in this world and represented in this House teaches that you feed the hungry. Not as charity. but as a mandate. because thats what it is to be a human being in our world. All the religions have written letters and implored us not to do this. I participated three times in the congressional food stamp challenge in which we eat on $31.50 for an entire week. Im not complaining about it because I knew it was just a week and it would end. but thats the average SNAP benefit. You know what? You can get the calories. Thats pretty easy if youre lucky enough to live near a grocery store and not in a food desert. The reality for 48 million people is that you can get the calories. but its really hard to get the nutrition. By the time you get to the fruits and vegetables. which are quite expensive. its hard to do it. Its not comfortable to rely on SNAP benefits. and many people line up at the end of the month at food pantries that are everywhere in this country. including some of the richest districts. But the SNAP program. which has a bipartisan history. is the last line of defense between 48 million Americans and chronic hunger. The House already voted down a farm bill that included $20 billion in SNAP cuts. and it would have taken benefits away from up to a million children and would have prevented 200.000 hungry children from getting the school lunches that they rely on so much. Now this bill is back but on steroids. In addition to all of the devastating cuts that have been proposed. those that were rejected earlier. the new bill would prevent any ablebodied adult from getting more than 3 months of SNAP benefits during a 3year period. even if theyre unable to find work. Up to 170.000 of those who are veterans who served our country would be denied. This is at a time when unemployment among lowincome Americans is over 20 percent and the average time of unemployment is about 9 months. Those numbers dont add up. It means that passage of this bill could nearly starve those looking for work. and no one can deny that fact. I know how SNAP benefits my constituents. and I know what would happen if those benefits were lost. Ive attended several events at food pantries and community centers. and each time Ive heard resounding support for SNAP. In just one day. I received 242 postcards from my constituents urging me to oppose these dangerous cuts to the SNAP program. They have my vote. and Im imploring my colleagues that it should have the vote of every Member of this body to reject those cuts. A constituent who previously wrote to my office summed up her thoughts about the importance of funding the SNAP program this way. Heres what she said: Hungry thoughts every waking day are my constant companion here in the supposedly wealthiest country on Earth. Please have compassion for your lowincome and fixedincome constituents who are loyal. patriotic Americans and who are in dire need of nutritious and affordable food. A former SNAP beneficiary. a woman named Dresden Shumaker. described the program as a trampoline rather than a safety net. Because of SNAP. she was able to make ends meet for her young family during a period of time of great need. Her story is similar to most SNAP beneficiaries who no longer need food assistance within one year of receiving benefits. Im begging my colleagues. please. dont support these cuts. Lets be the valuedriven country that we are and vote ""no"" to the $40 billion cut to SNAP. SNAP"
1130050646,Mr. Speaker. well. today is a historic day in our country. Despite a Republicanled government shutdown that was completely unnecessary. we are celebrating the opening of the Affordable Care Act or. as I affectionately call it. ObamaCare. You know. after almost 100 years of fighting to expand universal access to health insurance coverage in the United States of America. in 2010. Congress finally passed. the President signed. and the Supreme Court upheld ObamaCare as the law of the land. And starting today. Americans will be able to learn about the health plan choices and the financial assistance that is going to be available to them. An army of inperson assisters have been trained and stand ready to help Americans understand their options and enroll in coverage that best meets their needs. Americans can go to healthcare.gov. or in Illinois. where Im from. getcoveredillinois.gov is up and running. Now I have heard from colleagues on the other side. all these scare things about how terrible ObamaCare is going to be for the country and for individuals. Let me read to you some constituent letters that I have received. This is from Gayle Weiss. She says: I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1997 and have consistently been denied affordable insurance since that time. I am so excited that our President has taken steps to help all Americans with access to health care. Its so fitting that tomorrow is my 59th birthday. and what a fantastic birthday gift. Finally. I wont have to worry about losing everything Ive worked so hard for if. God forbid. I suffer a catastrophic health issue. No one should have to risk their future for something they have no control over. like illness. I heard from David Zoltan. He is 34 years old. This is what he writes: One week before Lehman Brothers went under. I was laid off from my job at the time and spent the next 2 years without health insurance. As a diabetic. the scariest thing in the world is to go without health insurance. Insulin averages around $100 to $120 per bottle. and I need approximately three bottles each of two kinds of insulin every month to live. I had to rely on my doctors to help me apply for any charity care program we could find or beg for the very medicines I needed to survive on a daily basis. Even so. I had to visit the hospital emergency room several times just to get insulin when my doctors couldnt get me free medication. ObamaCare gave me the preexisting condition plan pools as a lifeline until better solutions were available. ObamaCare has done so much for me. and Im proud today to see the beginning of the largest expansion of health care in my lifetime. There will be problems to fix. but we are America. We will fix these problems. We will give the precious necessity of health security to our citizens. We will prevail. And then I also heard from Eva Strobeck. She said: I used to get insurance from my husband. who retires in January. I am one of those people for whom it is impossible to get insurance independently. I have three illnesses. ObamaCare makes it possible to get insurance at an affordable rate. which I cannot do without. My psychological medications alone cost about $5.000 per month. I cant survive without ObamaCare. It must be funded by Congress. So I want to say that this effort to defund something that will bring lifesaving health care to millions of Americans. about 30 million Americans who either have to go bankrupt. who have to pay exorbitant prices. or simply have to do without health insurance. who would be against that? Are there going to be glitches in the program? Of course there are. Medicare part D had news article after news article talking about the problems of this health benefit for the elderly. Lets get on with it and provide health care for all Americans starting today.
1130077680,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 4 minutes. My dear colleagues. this is the simplest of simple amendments. It asks of this House only one thing. to acknowledge the truth of these words: Greenhouse gas pollution is contributing to longlasting changes in our climate that can have a range of negative effects. Our country and this Congress are at a critical moment in the history of our small planet. We are privileged as leaders of the most powerful country on Earth to be in a position to lead the world in combating climate change. There is still time. If we act now. we can protect our natural resources. like water. promote job growth. and ensure that our descendants are able to live healthy lives on this planet long after we are gone. Making the right choice begins with accepting the fact of climate change. It is hard to ignore this reality. The 10 hottest years in human history all occurred since 1998. This time last year. we had just completed the hottest year ever in the United States. a full degree hotter in terms of average temperature than the previous record. Though we are dealing with cold in many parts of the U.S. this year. the scientists tell us global temperatures are continuing to warm. Micronesia. the Marshall Islands. and Palau. among others. will be submerged during this century unless meaningful action is taken. Here at home. we are seeing more and more severe droughts. wildfires. storms. and hurricanesoften all in the same year. There are tremendous economic incentives for the United States to take climate change seriously. In December. the Pew Charitable Trust estimated that the clean energy sector could generate $1.9 trillion in revenue from 2012 to 2018. We also know that there are three times as many jobs created per dollar spent on renewable energy than on fossil fuel. As we work to create an economy that supports 21st century jobs. how can we overlook one of the worlds fastestgrowing industrial sectors and the millions of jobs it would support? Large multinational corporations have joined environmentalists. scientists. and the vast majority of the American public who recognize the impact of carbon pollution on our world. For example. CocaCola has already suffered from a global water shortage that is driving up costs. and Coke has recognized climate change as a challenge to its future profitability. The business plans of ExxonMobil and other Big Five oil companies assume they will have to pay for the cost of carbon in the future. This Congress should recognize the same facts that these business leaders have accepted: climate change is real and requires a different game plan. History will not be kind to climate change deniers. The SchakowskyLowenthal amendment doesnt ask for much. It doesnt change the bills provisions. It simply asks us as 21st century leaders of the most powerful country in the world to say ""yes"" to this simple fact: climate change is real and can have negative consequences. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130084356,Mr. Speaker. there has actually been a debate on this floor by all of my colleagues. women. coming down from the Republican side. talking about how wonderful this bill is for women and how bad ObamaCare is for women. I want to make this point. which is that. before the Affordable Care Act was passed. there was gender discrimination against women. The standard body was clearly the male body because women were paying about 48 percent more for health care before this law went into effect. a law that said there would be no more gender discrimination. that women could not be charged more because things like pregnancy might take place. Women became among the biggest winners under the new Affordable Care Act. In talking about protecting women. it is interesting to me that the Republicans. including my women colleagues. oppose the raising of the minimum wage. Twothirds of minimum wage workers are women. They oppose the Paycheck Fairness Act. Isnt it time in 2014 that women get paid equal pay for equal work? They oppose the funding of preschool. They support a budget that would cut Pell Grants for colleges. They oppose making sure that the Affordable Care Act will provide contraceptives as a preventative service to women. I am also hearing about the economics of freedom. Under the Affordable Care Act. now you dont have to be locked into a job because you need the health insurance. That is what I call freedom. Suddenly. entrepreneurialism is unleashed because women. and men are able to say. I am going to take a risk. but I am going to still be able to find health insurance. The other thing I hear is that it is a job killer. Actually. H.R. 2575 would force 1 million people to lose their employerprovided coverage. and it would increase the number of uninsured up to 500.000. This is not a number that has come out of some Democratic think tank. This is a number that comes from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Ask the workers themselves. and this is what they will tell you. The National Education Association says. We oppose this bill because we believe it would create a disincentive for employers to provide health coverage. They act like we are changing what fulltime employment is. from 30 to 40 hours.
1130102285,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to H.R. 3301. My Republican colleagues argue that we need more bills like H.R. 3301 to transport oil and gas as quickly as possible. but building a modern energy infrastructure for the 21st century requires more than just drilling more wells. laying more pipelines. filling more rail cars with crude oil. and putting more tanker trucks on our highways. A modern 21st century infrastructure must address the threat of climate change. the biggest energy challenge we face as a country. Republicans can deny it all they want. but we cant have a meaningful conversation about Americas energy infrastructure without also having a conversation about climate. We have a rapidly diminishing window to act to reduce our carbon pollution before the catastrophic impacts of climate change are irreversible. In fact. we are seeing. today. the devastating consequences in many parts of our country. The International Energy Agency has concluded that. if the world does not take action to reduce carbon pollution before 2017. then dangerous levels of carbon emissions will be locked in by the energy infrastructure existing at that time. The energy infrastructure decisions that we make today will have a real impact on whether we can mitigate climate change in the future or lock in carbon pollution for generations to come. My Republican colleagues dont like to hear this message. and that is reflected in the bill we are discussing today. If enacted into law. H.R. 3301 would move us backward in our fight to address climate change. It essentially pretends that climate change doesnt exist. H.R. 3301 would rubberstamp permits for pipelines to carry tar sands crude from Canada into the United States. Tar sands crude is the dirtiest fuel on the planet. from a climate perspective. but this bill creates a permitting process for crossborder pipelines that makes it difficult. if not impossible. for the Federal Government to say no. The bill even allows the oil industry to make major modifications to its pipelines without getting any approval at all. That means. if a company wants to increase its pipeline capacity or reverse an existing pipeline to carry more tar sands crude from Canada into the United States. the company can just do it. no questions asked. Building new tar sands pipelines or expanding existing ones could have a profound environmental impact. but the bill allows for no meaningful environmental review. For a crossborder pipeline. the bill says the Federal Government can only examine the environmental impact of the crossborder segment of the project. It is almost hard to believe that that is what the bill does. but it is true. For a pipeline spanning hundreds of miles. the environmental review will focus on only a tiny part that crosses the U.S. border. That eliminates the possibility of any meaningful examination of the carbon pollution impacts of these pipelines. That is irresponsible. We know. from our examination of the Keystone XL pipeline. that it will facilitate the production of tar sands crude which is. on average. 17 percent more greenhouse gas intensive than the average crude refined in the United States. We should be examining the carbon impact of every pipeline before we approve it. not ignoring the problem altogether. That brings us back to Keystone XL. This bill gives TransCanada virtual assurance that Keystone XL will be approved. Even if President Obama finds that the Keystone XL pipeline is not in the national interest and denies the national permit. this bill allows TransCanada to simply reapply and approve it under the new rubberstamp process. with no consideration of the profound environmental climate. I want to remind my colleagues that this debate and this vote are part of the permanent record. Dont betray your grandchildren and their grandchildren by condemning them to a planet where it is hard to breathe and agriculture is affected. The future will belong to the country that builds an energy infrastructure to support a cleaner. lowcarbon economy. It is our responsibility to lead the country and even the world in that direction. This bill takes us backwards. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3301.
1130106893,"Mr. Chairman. all of us know that hardworking men and women in all of our districts are having a rough time these days. Many are paid low wages or wages that are not enough to meet their familys basic needs. Those problems are made even worse when workers are the victims of wage theft. Billions of dollars are actually stolen from workers through wage theft. and wage theft occurs when workers are forced to work off the clock. denied earned overtime pay. or paid less than the minimum wage. Workers can lose pay because of illegal paycheck deductions. be denied their final paychecks. or not be paid at all. Interfaith Worker Justice. based in Chicago. has been working to stop wage theft for years. In 2008. its executive director. Kim Bobo. wrote a book called ""Wage Theft in America: Why Millions of Working Americans Are Not Getting PaidAnd What We Can Do About It."" My amendment is one step we can take to do something about it. My amendment is simple. The idea is the same idea that has been offered on the House floor by my friend and colleague. Representative KEITH ELLISON. and is supported by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. It says that Federal contractors have a duty to pay their workers their legallyearned wages and that corporations that dont pay their workers their legallyearned wages shouldnt benefit from Federal contracts. Similar language has successfully been added to the Energy and Water and Department of Defense Appropriations bills. Wage theft has been documented. One study of workers in Chicago. Los Angeles. and New York City found that 26 percent were paid below legal minimum wage levels. 76 percent were denied earned overtime. and 70 percent were not paid for work outside of their regular shifts. The North Carolina Justice Center found that workers in that State lost $33 million in pay because of wage theft over the course of 5 years. The Economic Policy Institute found that ""In total. the average lowwage worker loses a stunning $2.634 per year in unpaid wages. representing 15 percent of their income."" This is a problem in many sectors. and that includes Federal contractors. A report by the Senate Health. Education. and Labor and Pensions Committee revealed that 32 percent of the largest Department of Labor penalties for wage theft were levied against Federal contractors. National Employment Law Project found that 21 percent of Federal contract workers were not paid overtime and 11 percent had been forced to work off the clock. Federal contract employees deserve to receive the dollars they have earned. the dollars that they need. the dollars they would spend in their communities. and the dollars that taxpayers awarded the contractors for those wages. All workers should be safe from wage theft. but my amendment is much more modest. It just says that a contract under this FY 2015 Appropriations bill cant be awarded to a corporation found to be in violation of wage requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act. It says that corporations that cheat their employees out of hardearned wages are not deserving of taxpayerfunded Federal contracts. It sends a clear message: obey the law. pay your workers the wages they have earned. or we wont give you the benefit of a taxpayerfinanced Federal contract. Allowing corporations to get away with violating the law is not just bad for their workers and taxpayers. it is unfair to the businesses that are competing for Federal contracts but wont engage in wage theft to get a competitive edge. Do we really want to tell corporations that they can violate the law and steal wages from their workers and still get a Federal contract. or do we want to take a small stand by saying that only companies that play by the wage rules we have enacted will be eligible? I hope we can agree that breaking the law in order to underpay workers is not acceptable. certainly should not be rewarded. and certainly not with taxpayer dollars. I urge my colleagues to help the workers who work for us. Support the Congressional Progressive Caucus amendment. I certainly urge a ""yes"" vote on the amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois ."

1130036345,"I want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina for his leadership in cosponsoring this particular amendment with me. We introduced this amendment because. with a nearly $17 trillion debt. the Federal Government can no longer continue to subsidize wasteful programs and policies. The programs that this amendment would eliminatesome of them in my own Statedo little to achieve their intended purpose of economic development. These are wasteful programs that the GAO. the Government Accountability Office. and even the Obama administration have found to be duplicative and possessing no track record of success. In his 2012 budget. President Obama eliminated Federal funding for the Denali Commission. for example. His argument. which I agree with. was that the Denali projects are not funded through a free market or a meritbased system. Additionally. the White House noted that there are 29 other Federal programs capable of fulfilling this commissions mandate. I would submit that this is also the case for a number of other commissionsfor example. the Appalachian Regional Commission. the Delta Regional Authority. the Northern Border Regional Commission. and the Southeast Crescent Regional Commissionfor which we reduced and eliminated the funding. Of particular note and concern is a recent report from the Denali Commission inspector general. which states that $100 million is missing from the Denali Commission bank accounts. In his 2012 semiannual report to Congress. the inspector general recounted his attempts to track down the lost fundsunsuccessfully. I might addand recommended that Congress not reauthorize the commission in light of this mismanagement. Like Citizens Against Government Waste. I seek to end the Federal appropriations for this commission as well as for the others that I mentioned. By reducing the appropriations to these programs. my amendment would save $90 million for American taxpayers. GAO analysis found numerous Federal programs that overlap and provide similar services. In these reports. GAO found no fewer than 80 Federal economic development programs administered by four different agencies. Year after year we hear about the inefficiency and waste that is occurring within these programs. This inefficiency. duplication and overlap have cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the years. These commissions were established for one purpose: economic development. Yet the CBO and other organizations have found no factual evidence that these commissions have created jobs or have improved education or health care. The inability to determine the success of these commissions is. in part. due to their overlap with other programs and agencies. In summary. there is a tremendous amount of duplication and overlap in each one of the programs that I mentioned. so they are better dealt with at the State and local levels. The officials there are much closer to these types of programs than is the Federal Government. The programs have no track record of success in doing what they were intended to do. which is to create economic development and job growth. It just hasnt happened. The GAO report. as I indicated. has stated that the programs are duplicative and that there is a tremendous amount of mismanagement. Taxpayers are fed up with wasteful spending in Washington. Its time we identified wasteful programs. These are truly almost the definition of ""wasteful programs."" and we need to cut them. I would urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130046257,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise today as a strong supporter and cosponsor of H.R. 2449. legislation to extend for 2 additional years the existing U.S.-South Korea civilian nuclear energy agreement. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. its my strong belief that passage of this legislation is in the national interest of the United States and also in the vital interest of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. Earlier this year. we held a hearing in our subcommittee to examine the facts behind the current nuclear energy agreement with South Korea and why it needs to be extended. Simply put. the agreement with South Korea strengthens Americas nonproliferation priorities. it helps to create American jobs in the energy sector. and its an important symbol of our long friendship with South Korea. I want to commend my colleague from California . the chairman of the full committee. and also the ranking member of the committee from New York. ELIOT ENGEL. for introducing this bipartisan legislation. Americas friendship with South Korea is stronger today than probably at any other moment in our history. Forged on the cold. dark battlefields of the Korean war. this years 60th anniversary of the U.S.-South Korea alliance marks a significant milestone in our evergrowing relationship. There is no doubt it has indeed become the cornerstone of peace and security in East Asia. In fact. it is the enduring. relevant. and forwardlooking qualities of our alliance that makes todays consideration of this bill. H.R. 2449. so important. Today in South Korea. a once wartorn nation has become a worldclass economy and leader in hightech innovation. Its commitment to democracy. human rights. and the rule of law in a region where these ideals are oftentimes hard to come by is a testament to the trust we have in our ally and friend. South Korea. I once again thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for putting this particular legislation together. I would like to join them in urging my colleagues to support this bill.
1130048574,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 1961. legislation that my colleagues and I introduced to save the Delta Queen steamboat. And I want to particularly thank the gentleman from MissouriSt. Louis. in particularmy Democratic colleague. LACY CLAY. for his leadership on this particular issue. This legislation is basically one line. It doesnt cost a penny. and it has two very important functions. It preserves an important piece of American history. and it supports American jobs. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1961 reinstates the Delta Queens grandfathered statusnot an earmarkthe grandfathered status from a law that prohibits wooden boatswhich the superstructure of the Delta Queen is. The hull of it is steelfor carrying overnight passengers. The Delta Queen is actually capable of carrying"" up to 176 passengers comfortably overnight. and under the law as it currently exists. 50 is the cutoff point. Congress granted the Delta Queen a reprieve from this law for the last 40 years. So for 40 years. the United States Congress granted this exemption. It did so because she was constructed before the law was in place and because the law was intended for boats at sea. not riverboatsboats. oceangoing vessels at sea. It was never intended for riverfaring boats like the Delta Queen. Thats why the Congress granted this exemption for 40 years. The Queens grandfathered status was uninterrupted for 40 years until management concerns stalled the continuation back in 2008. Since Congress revoked its ability to operate. the boat has been chained to a dock. Discord and disagreement won that day. but today. hopefully. it will be different. Today we have a renewed coalition of support. Democrats and Republicans have worked together on this issue. It passed by voice vote with no votes against it in the Transportation Committee. and maybe most importantly. the boats new management and union are working together to return this vessel and the jobs she provides to full operation. So this is a situation where management and the union are not fighting. They may have been back in 2008. Theyre not now. Theyre together on this. Theyre both requesting that we pass this particular legislation today so that the Delta Queen can once again ply the riversthe Mississippi. the Ohioand bring jobs to communities all up and down those rivers. With all the gridlock in Washington. this bill is a welcome show of bipartisanship for a change. I wish we had more of that around this place. But this really is a bipartisan bill. Its supported by the Seafarers International Union. by the American Maritime Officers. and by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. for example. Its cosponsored by a diverse list of Republicans and Democrats. including the entire Ohio delegation. including my colleagueand I want to thank him for his leadership on this issueBRAD WENSTRUP from the Second District. right next to my district. the First District. in the greater Cincinnati area. He has been a leader on this. as has Congressman MASSIE across the river. And as I mentioned before. Congressman LACY CLAY from Missouri and many other Members. It also has the support of Transportation Committee Chairman SHUSTER on the Republican side and Ranking Member RAHALL. And I would like to read a quote from the gentleman from West Virginia . the ranking member. who was unable to be here today. Actually. I think he is driving here and will be here for votes. but couldnt make the debate. But this is what he said back in the Transportation Committee itself. and I am quoting here from his testimony: ""Im in favor of preserving an icon of our American heritage. the Delta Queen. In light of the support that this bill has from the Seafarers""-the Seafarers Union-""and the fact that this means goodpaying jobs and that a unique part of Americana would be restored to service. I support the pending legislation."" Thats the bill that we are dealing with here today. And in the past. this effort was even cosponsored by two men who rarely see eye to eye. Senator MITCH MCCONNELL and thenSenator Barack Obama. Both of them supported this back in 2008. I owe thanks to every lawmaker who cosponsored this measure. And I owe a special thanks. as I mentioned. to the gentleman from St. Louis. Missouri"
1130048602,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I agree with certainly some of the comments of my colleague from California. Safety is paramount. Its paramount to us. just as it is to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle both in support and in opposition of this legislation. and it is also to the unions and to the merchants and a whole range of people. The Coast Guard will ultimately determine whether its safe or not. It cannot get a certificate to ply the waters of the Ohio or Mississippi unless the United States Coast Guard determines that its safe. We agree on that. Is the Delta Queen safe? Well. the Delta Queen has operated safely for more than 80 years. In all that time. theres never been a fire that required any passenger evacuationnot one in over an 80year period of time. As a riverboat. the Delta Queen. as I mentioned before. is never more than a mile away. This was the Safety at Seas Act. as our colleague from Kentucky mentioned. that were talking about. This legislation was supposed to apply to oceangoing vessels at sea. not the rivers. The Coast Guard more broadly brought in the rivers. And thats why Congress said. Look. we dont mean this to apply to rivers. So if it applies to any boats. any ships here on the rivers. then were going to give them an exemption. There was only one boat it applied to that was big enough to have over 50 passengers. That was the Delta Queen. because it has a steel hull and steel paddles in the back and a wooden superstructure. We have given this exemption for 40 years. From 1968 through 200840 yearsCongress gave the exemption because we considered it to be safe. Now. its going to be certified by the Coast Guard that its safe before it ever goes anywhere. The Delta Queen will still be required. as I said. to get a certificate from the Coast Guard in order to move. Now. let me read from a couple of those groups. Weve heard from Members of Congress here. This is the Seafarers International Union. who had been opposed to this back in 2008 and who is now solidly supportive. Heres what the Seafarers Union said: We write to express our support for H.R. 1961. This legislation would effectively permit the Delta Queen steamboat to return to operation as a riverfaring vessel. While there is still much restorative work ahead before the boat can return to full operation. securing the congressional waiver is the first and most critical step in that path. Thats what this is all about: the restorative workthe new boilers. the new steam pipes. We are talking probably $10 million worth of restoration. But in order for anybody to put money into that. to make the ship better. to make it safe. etc.. it needs this exemption in order to allow the private sector to get the money into the boat so that it can actually continue on the history that weve seen for many years in this country on this particular boat. Let me continue with the letter: This particular vessel has been a source of jobs for many merchant mariners over its tenure as an overnight cruise vessel. and it can be again. Unfortunately. absent the congressional waiver afforded by this legislation. these jobs will forever be lost. Thats what the Seafarers International Union said. The American Maritime Officers said: ""This legislation will help create the circumstances for the Delta Queen to return to operation as a riverfaring vessel. The owners of this vessel understand they will need to make investments to improve the ship before she receives first approval from the Coast Guard to begin operating in regular service again. Passing H.R. 1961 will give those parties the assurance they require to undertake those efforts""-to spend the $10 million on the boat. ""Bringing the Delta Queen back in operation status is a worthy effort. It will help create jobs through work that needs to be done."" These maritime officers wouldnt want to be sailing on a dangerous boat."
1130089501,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to thank Chairman GOODLATTE. Ranking Member CONYERS. and my friend from Tennessee for cosponsoring this legislation. This is simple. straightforward legislation. It clarifies the relationship between the Immunity from Seizure Act and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to encourage the foreign lending of art to the United States. Currently. artwork loaned by foreign governments is commonly immune to Federal court decisions and cannot be confiscated if the President finds that their display is in the national interest. However. foreign governments do not have immunity when commercial activity is involved. This bill seeks to clarify that artwork imported into the U.S. for temporary display is not commercial activity and should thus be immune from seizure. Specifically. my legislation would revise the United States Code and make clear that the import of artwork is not legally considered commercial activity if three elements are met: First. the United States. or an educational institute therein. and a foreign government must agree to the exchange of artwork. Second. the President must determine that such work is of cultural significance and the temporary exhibition of such work is in the national interest. And third. the Presidents determination must be published in the Federal Register. In enacting the Immunity from Seizure Act. Congress recognized that cultural exchange would produce substantial benefits to the United States. both artistically and diplomatically. Foreign lending should be allowed to continue to aid cultural understanding and increase public exposure to archeological artifacts. This bill reaffirms our countrys commitment to the foreign lending of artwork to American museums. However. for artwork and cultural objects owned by foreign governments. the intent of the Immunity from Seizure Act is being frustrated currently by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. A provision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act opens foreign governments up to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts for court actions if foreign governmentowned artwork is temporarily imported into the U.S. Similar to its Senate companion. this bill includes a Naziera exception which provides that immunity does not apply to cases in which property was taken in violation of international law. and those are things which are in question. and the action is based upon a claim that such work was taken in connection with acts of the German Government during the period of January 30. 1933. through May 8. 1945. According to the American Association of Museum Directors. current law has led to. on several occasions. foreign governments declining to exchange artwork and cultural objects with the United States for temporary exhibitions. In 2010. for example. the Russian Federation imposed a ban on stateowned art loans to American museums on the grounds that such works could be subject to legal action. As a result of this ban. several U.S. museums. which had loan agreements with the Russian national institutions. were forced to cancel longplanned Russian art exhibits. In order to keep the exchange of foreign governmentowned art flowing. Congress needs to clarify the relationship between these two acts that I previously described. This legislation does just that: ensuring that museums. like the Cincinnati Museum Center and the Cincinnati Art Museumboth in my districtand other similar museums all across the country. may continue to present firstclass exhibits and educate the public on cultural heritage and artwork from all around the globe. Through the enactment of this legislation. we can secure foreign lending to American museums and ensure that foreign art lenders are not entangled in unnecessary litigation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1130090224,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise today as a strong supporter and cosponsor of H. Res. 418. urging the Government of Burma to end the persecution of the Rohingya people and to respect internationally recognized human rights for all ethnic and religious minority groups within Burma. I want to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts . my friend and colleague. for offering this legislation. which is certainly timely. and we appreciate his leadership on this. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. I believe it is imperative that the U.S. and the international community raise awareness of this ongoing crisis in Burma and of the need for its government to respect the human rights of all of its ethnic and religious minority groups. which it is clearly not doing at this time. Last year. we held two hearings in my subcommittee to examine the deteriorating human rights situation and ethnic unrest in Burma. It has become abundantly clear that the political and social situation there is extremely fragile and that the continuing persecution of the minority Rohingya population is just. as was said. a profound crisis. Some 140.000 displaced Rohingya have been forced to live in camps described as openair prisons. Doctors Without Borders was forced out by the Burmese Government. and since then. nearly 150 Rohingya have died of medicallyrelated causes. This particular photo illustrates that the Doctors Without Borders clinic is shuttered. They are gone. The people are not getting the medical care that they are entitled to. and people are literally dying as a result of this. Further. mob violence has made a number of other international NGOs evacuate Burma for fear and for being. essentially. excluded by the government. They were doing good work for people who really needed it. who were in dire straits. The Burmese Government has taken few. if any. steps to forge a peaceful. harmonious. and prosperous future for the Rakhine State. It is complicit in extrajudicial killings. rape. arbitrary detention. torture. deaths in detention. and for the denial of due process and fair trial rights for the Rohingya. As these horribly repressed people who are afforded no identity by the Burmese Government have been forced into camps. the Burmese Government has confiscated their land. their homes. and property for redistribution to the Buddhist Rakhine majority. A recent report by the group United to End Genocide found that nowhere else in the world are there more precursors to genocidesigns that genocide may well happenthan in Burma right now. This is why I recently introduced H.R. 4377. the Burma Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2014. with my colleague from New York . a Democrat. This legislation would place conditions on providing International Military and Educational Training or for Foreign Military Financing assistance to the Burmese Government. In light of the Burmese Governments and militarys complicity in these ongoing human rights abuses against the Rohingya and other ethnic groups. it is much too soon for us to be engaging at a level that provides U.S. foreign assistance to Burmas corrupt and abusive military. It concerns me that the administration still refuses to cooperate or to detail what its strategy really is for the future of military engagement with Burma. Mr. Speaker. H. Res. 418 highlights its need for the U.S. and international community to continue pressuring Burma to end its blatant persecution and discrimination of the Rohingya population. I want to. again. thank Mr. McGovERN. Mr. FRANKS. Mr. PITTS. and Mr. SMITH for cosponsoring this resolution. I believe the passage of the resolution will send a strong message to the Burmese Government. and I would urge my colleagues to support this measure.
1130097223,Mr. Chairman. my amendment would reduce section 8 spending across the board by 10 percent. $3 billion. and place the savings in the spending reduction account. The section 8 voucher program. which was intended to provide temporary assistance for struggling Americans. has become. unfortunately. a way of life for far too many in this country. Many of our communities. like my community. Cincinnati. are struggling to deal with the programs unintended consequences in many instances in many neighborhoods. As a result. the program is in need of serious reform. For example. to help reduce dependency on the program. we should establish time limits for beneficiaries. except for the elderly or disabled. The payments should not go on basically forever. as they do under current law. To make certain that section 8 landlords are accountable to local communities. landlords should be required to comply with local laws and ordinances. and not be allowed to hide behind the HUD regulations when faced with complaints about their properties. To make the program safer for both its recipients and the neighbors of those recipients. we need to ensure that convicted felons and sex offenders are barred from participation in the section 8 program. If you are able to work. then you should have to work in order to be eligible for section 8 benefits. Until reforms like these have been implemented. spending more tax dollars on the Section 8 voucher program is akin to throwing good money after bad. Faced with a national debt that exceeds $17 trillion and. in fact. is around $17.5 trillion now. continuing this funding is something we simply cannot afford. Mr. Chairman. as we look for areas to reduce Federal spending. a broken program like section 8 that rewards government dependency with our tax dollars is a good place to start. Those other things that I mentioned are things that we have offered in the past and intend to offer in legislation in the future. But relative to this particular amendment. this would just cut the funding by $3 billion. which is approximately 10 percent of the section 8 program. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130116388,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5108. a bill to establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This bill has bipartisan support. I would like to thank the gentleman from New York. Congressman JEFFRIES. for his leadership on this issue. and I know that he will be speaking here on this matter shortly. It is my pleasure to be the principal Republican cosponsor of the bill which would make this successful pilot program available to law schools all across the country. This program was first established by the Patent and Trademark Office in 2008 and has allowed law students at 45 participating schools to practice patent or trademark law before the Patent and Trademark Office under the guidance of a supervisor. This practical experience is invaluable and is a worthwhile investment in our Nations future attorneys. Expanding this program will also benefit our Nations small businesses. Through this program inventors and entrepreneurs will gain access to quality legal services and protections that they otherwise often could not afford. Additionally. establishing this program will improve the quality of applications submitted to the Patent and Trademark Office thereby hopefully streamlining the review process. I am pleased to say that several universities from Ohio. my home State. were already selected to participate in the current pilot program. Those are Case Western Reserve University School of Law in the Cleveland area and the University of Akron School of Law. The CBO has examined and scored this bill finding that the costs are quite reasonable. about $200.000 a year to operate in all 45 participating schools so we are really getting a bang for our buck with this program. I look forward to following the successes of this worthwhile program as it unfolds. and I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Once again I want to thank the gentleman from New York for his leadership and the fact that this is a bipartisan bill. It is a good thing to see this type of bill move its way through the House. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130125354,"Mr. Speaker. I stand before you today a proud alumnus of Cincinnatis La Salle High School because. for the first time in the schools 54year history. the Lancers have won the Ohio State football championship. Last Friday evening the Lancers claimed the title with a 5520 victory. breaking the record for most points ever scored in an Ohio Division II championship game. La Salles offense was so strong this season that in each of their five playoff games they averaged nearly 50 points. Leading the offense was junior running back Jeremy Larkin. who ran over 2.500 yards in just 15 games. scored 42 touchdowns. and is now a finalist for the coveted Ohio Mr. Football Award. All season long. La Salle competed with the best of the best. finishing with 14 wins and one nailbiting loss to the St. X Bombers. including victories over such powerhouses as Moeller. Elder. and Colerain High Schools. Mr. Speaker. as I mentioned. La Salle is my alma mater. I graduated in 1971 and played football all 4 years. I played on the defensive line. And in my senior year. we won seven games. lost onecoincidentally. to future Speaker JOHN BOEHNERS Moeller High School. where he played football too. although he had already graduated 3 years earierand we tied Elder 00 in the Pit and tied St. Xs 1818. Mr. Speaker. I stand before you today a very proud alumnus of my high school. I also want to mention that my brother Dave. who is 10 years younger than me. also played football at La Salle. and he was a defensive back there. La Salle will always have a special place in my heart. I learned many of lifes most important lessons in her halls and on the football field. As a matter of fact. my political career got my start at La Salle when I was first elected to student council there. La Salle is a great school. I want to thank the coaches and the teachers and the staff and especially the parents who have made the sacrifices to pay the tuition there to make it possible for their sons to receive a tremendous education at La Salle. Mr. Speaker. boxing legend Muhammad Ali once said ""Champions arent made in the gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside thema desire. a dream. and a vision."" This season. the Lancers had the desire to make every practice count and play every game as if it were their last. They shared a dream that was strong enough to overcome the many distractions that high school kids often face in todays world. and their coaches gave them the vision that their hard work and sacrifice would pay off in the end. Mr. Speaker. Lancers roll deep. This season illustrated that to the team. the school. and the community. Congratulations on a season well played and a job well done. Go. Lancers."

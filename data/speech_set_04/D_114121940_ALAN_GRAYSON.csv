1140011171,"Mr. Chairman. my amendment would require the Secretary of Education to conduct an assessment of the impact of school start times on student health. wellbeing. and performance. It is supported by the National Education Association. the American Academy of Pediatrics. and the National Sleep Federation. In my district. some schools begin the day at 7 a.m.. and others begin at 9:15. I am sure we see similar disparities all around the country. As the father of five schoolage children. I believe that 7 a.m. is probably too early to get the best out of the developing minds and bodies of our young people. That being said. I want to make it clear that this amendment does not mandate any change to school start times in the least. It simply seeks a national study on this topic. Maybe that study will prove me right. maybe it wont. Either way. localities will remain free to continue to choose the start times for their schools that make the most sense for them. hopefully being better informed by this study. My amendment. should it be accepted. will make those decisions possible with more information than is currently available. According to research already available by the director of the Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of Minnesota. later school start times in Minneapolis and Edina. Minnesota. have led to increased attendance rates. improved graduation rates. increased GPAsin fact. in llth grade. the mean grade went from a B to almost an Aminusand significantly less depression among our students. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that insufficient sleep for young people leads to an increase in risky behavior. including increased tobacco use. increased alcohol consumption. and increased sexual activity. A recent study at the U.S. Air Force Academy even found ""significant negative effects""-that is a direct quote""significant negative effects"" every single year for those students who enrolled in the Air Forces early morning courses. A study on the Wake County. North Carolina. school district start times showed that students with a 1hour later start time gained on State assessment reading and math scores significantly and substantially. An analysis of SAT scores in Hingham. Massachusetts. showed that delayed school starts. a school start a little bit later in the morning. resulted in a 31 point increase in SAT scores for those students with no other change in their schedule or in their standards. With all these disparate localized research results. isnt it time for a national study to see if these trends might be replicable across the country and could give our students a better education? I hope that the information gained from such a studysuch as one that I am proposingwould be useful to students. I hope it will be useful to parents. and I hope it will be useful to State and local governments and school authorities as they consider and determine their appropriate start times. According to the Congressional Budget Office. this amendment would have absolutely no impact on direct Federal spending. Again. I want to reiterate that this amendment is not a mandate in any sense whatsoever. It only requires a deeper look at the effects school start times have on the health. wellbeing. and performance of students across America. Mr. Chairman. we should be eager to research anything that could possibly benefit our Nations K12 students. our own children. Toward that end. I urge support for this amendment. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1140030754,"Mr. Chairman. this amendment is akin to an amendment that was considered just a few moments ago offered by Mr. MEADOWS. This amendment is meant to address a problem that has arisen with trade agreements that has become visible to all of us as Members of this august body. What has happened is that the Trade Representative. for no apparent legal reason. with no apparent legal authority. has taken it upon himself to negotiate trade agreements like the TransPacific Partnership in secretnot entirely in secret. just in secret from us and from members of the American public. The corresponding provision. the TTIP provision. has been posted by the European Union. which is our negotiating partner in this on the Internet. The TransPacific Partnership itself has been negotiated in secret. but that has been posted by WikiLeaks. to the embarrassment of our government in an unnecessary manner. What we have seen over the past several years is that the Trade Representative has turned a deaf ear to our concerns as Members of Congress who must perform our oversight functions whenever we ask for information about what the Trade Representative is doing on behalf of the American people. Three years ago. we had the strange circumstance come up that over 100 Members of Congress. 100 Members of this body. wrote a letter to the Trade Representative saying: We hear you are negotiating something called the TransPacific Partnership. Would you please give us a copy? And the answer came back: No. We are not going to give you a copy. For the past 5 years. the TransPacific Partnership has been negotiated in secret. Only in the last few months. Members of Congress have been able to see it under the most extreme conditions imaginable. I was actually the first person to be able to see it. and the Trade Representative came to my office with his staff and offered to show it to me. but I couldnt take any notes. I couldnt discuss it with my own staff. I couldnt even discuss it with other Members of this body. And of course I couldnt make copies or otherwise help myself to record what I had seen. much less speak to my constituents about it. much less speak to the media about it. much less speak to the public about it. Respectfully. secret laws are unAmerican laws. secret agreements are unAmerican agreements. There is no such thing recognized under our Constitution as a ""secret statute"" or a ""secret treaty."" But that is. in effect. what we have been experiencing without any legal authority whatsoever on behalf of the Trade Representative. Now. I am not saying the Trade Representative needs to stop negotiating these agreements. not at all. What I am suggesting is that we lift the veil of secrecy that has been dropped over these negotiations so that we cant see them. the American people cant see them. but foreign governments can see them. Why is it that we have confidentiality? Why is it that we have a classified information system? Generally speaking. it is not to keep Americans from seeing this information. it is to keep foreigners from seeing this information. And here the world has been turned upside down. and we have a situation where foreigners get to see it. but even the highest members of our own governmentour Senators. our Congressmenwe dont get to see it. That is absolutely unacceptable. it is unAmerican. The only way to come up with agreements that satisfy the needs of this country is through an open. fair. transparent process. That is what this simple amendment will accomplish. It says: None of the funds made available in this act. which includes funds made to the Trade Representative. may be used to negotiate or enter into a trade agreement whose negotiating texts are confidential. It is time for a little sunlight. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. It is time for the Members of this body to take control of our constitutional responsibilities. not to let the Trade Representative or any member of the executive branch tell us to stuff it when we need to find out things in order to be able to do our jobs properly. Wouldnt it be a better system if we were able to tell a trade representative what we think. what our constituents think. what the members of the American public think about these documents before they are simply dropped on us? This is a simple commonsense amendment. There is no existing legal authority that allows the Trade Representative to do what he has been doing. I say the time is up and we should insist that these agreements. which will determine the course of economic history in America for the next 20 or 30 years. are agreements that are negotiated in public with our approval and with our input. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140030810,Mr. Chairman. this amendment has nothing to do with medical marijuana. It was passed last year by a vote of this body of 225183. in other words. it passed by a majority of 42 votes. The purpose of this amendment is to raise the possibility of a Federal shield law that corresponds to protections already in place in 49 States but not at the level of the Federal Government. Again. to be clear about this. 49 States have a Federal shield law. The Federal Government does notat least up to this point. A shield law is designed to protect a reporters privilege: the right of news reporters to refuse to testify on information and sources of information obtained during the news gathering and dissemination process. In short. a reporter should not be forced to reveal his or her sources under penalty of imprisonment. This issue has come up in court cases at the Federal level and the Supreme Court level. beginning with the 1972 case of Branzburg v. Hayes. In that case. a reporter wished to inform his readers about the nature of the drug hashish. and he realized that the only way to go about that was to actually find and interview people who had actually used the drug hashish. so he did that. After he published his article. relying upon two confidential sources. he was subpoenaed by the police to provide his sources so that they could be arrested. compromising their identity and compromising his journalistic integrity. So he was forced to choose whether he would conceal his sources and go to prison or he would reveal his sources and have them go to prison. simply because he wanted to inform the public about this matter of concern. Some of us may remember the case of Valerie Plame. who was publicly identified as a covert operative. Reporters were continually asked to name the sources used in their reporting. and one reporter was jailed for 85 days for refusing to disclose sources in that government probe. At this point. under current law. journalists are in a quandaryan unnecessary and unhealthy quandary. They realize that they need to protect their sources. but that right is codified only at the State level and not yet at the Federal level. So what I am seeking to do. as I did last year with the assistance of this House. is to offer the journalists the protection they should have in order to do their jobs properly. Freedom of the press is not just an important principle. but it is part of the foundation of American law. The Constitution and the First Amendment provide for freedom of speech and of the press. It is completely incongruous to say that we have freedom of the press. but the Federal Government could nevertheless subpoena sources and put reporters in prison if they dont comply. I think that we should have settled this issue years if not decades ago. We did settle it last year successfully in this body. but we are here today to try to address it once more. Respectfully. I submit this amendment as a muchneeded and long delayed clarification that the Federal Government treats the issue of freedom of the press just as respectfully and just as importantly as the great majority of our States do49 out of 50. I ask for support of this amendment from my esteemed colleague. the gentleman from the Seventh District of Texas. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1140038780,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Chairman CALVERT and his staff for working with me on this amendment. It simply seeks to decrease and then increase by the same amount within the $2.5 billion appropriation for the environmental programs and management account within the Environmental Protection Agency. More specifically. my amendment seeks to remove and then reapply $2.2 million from that account. The intent behind my amendment is simple. It is to put the House on record of supporting a final funding amount of $27.310.000 for the National Estuary Program and coastal waterways. Currently. the report accompanying this bill calls for $25.098.000 for the National Estuary Program and coastal waterways. which is $2.212.000 below both the Senates proposed appropriations level and the Presidents request for fiscal year 2016. Hence. the amount specified in my amendment. The National Estuary Program and coastal waterways subaccount within the EPA does important work. including work in my State. especially on the Atlantic Coast. It addresses ocean acidification. seeks to remove coastal watersheds. furthers the National Estuary Programs restoration goals. and assists in the implementation of the very important Gulf of Mexico hypoxia action plan. Mr. Chairman. there is an area. a large area called the dead zone off of Louisiana that literally stinks. It has no fish. It has no recreational opportunities. It has no fishing. It is. in fact. a scar on the face of the Earth. Part of the funding for this program is used to try to overcome the hypoxia situation that has arisen off the coast of Louisiana that threatens to spread not only to Texas. Alabama. and Mississippi. but also to the coast of my State of Florida. eventually. if we do nothing about it. The estuarine regions of the United States comprise just 12 percent of land area of the United States. but they contain 43 percent of the U.S. population and provide 49 percent of all U.S. economic output. The economic value of coastal recreation alone in the United Statesbeach going. fishing. bird watching. snorkeling. diving. and so onhas conservatively been estimated by NOAA to be between $20 billion and $60 billion annually. Clearly. the $2.2 million increase in funding for the National Estuary Program and coastal waterways that I am seeking will result in dramatic returns for the American economy. an enhanced quality of life for the American people. and eliminate that scar on the face of planet Earth that exists off the coast of Louisiana and should never be allowed to spread. Mr. Chairman. I know that you support this amendment. and I am thankful for your support. With that in mind. I will stop talking before I lose your support. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida .
1140046476,Mr. Speaker. 50 years ago this week. President Lyndon Johnson signed the law that created Medicare and Medicaidthe most important healthcare programs in our countrys history prior to the Affordable Care Act. With one stroke of his pen. President Johnson guaranteed both poor Americans and older Americans the right to highquality. affordable medical treatment. Thanks to Medicare. for 50 years now. our seniors have received the health care they have needed to stay healthy and to live full lives. but despite the success. there are gaps in Medicare coverage that need to be closed. The most glaring gap is the fact that Medicare does not provide basic medical coverage for seniors eyes. ears. and teeth. It is as though Medicare assumes that seniors dont need to see or to hear or to chew. We are not talking about exotic. hightech treatments. We are talking about no Medicare coverage for eyeglasses. eye exams. hearing aids. cavity fillings. and dentures. We are talking about no treatment for medical conditions that lead to blindness. deafness. lost teeth. and serious gum disease. which has been strongly linked to heart disease. It is unthinkable that we deny our seniors this elementary level of care. There are 2.7 million seniors in America who are blind. How many of them would be able to see today if they had received simple annual eye exams as part of their Medicare coverage? Medicare is a promise that we make to ourselvesthe young to the old. one generation to the next. The promise is that. after you reach your 65th birthday. your medical needs will be met. To keep that promise. our seniors have paid into the system. in some cases for a half a century. before they receive a single earned benefit. They deserve the best care we can provide for them. This week. to honor the 50th anniversary of this lifesaving program we call Medicare. I am introducing the Seniors Have Eyes. Ears. and Teeth Act. This bill will amend title XVIIIthe Medicare provision of the Social Security Actto repeal the arbitrary exclusion of eyeglasses. eye exams. hearing aids. hearing exams. and dental care from Medicare coverage. Two short lines in the U.S. Code have barred that coverage for 50 years. I simply delete those lines. I urge my congressional colleagues to enact this quick. easy. and necessary reform. Medicare should provide health coverage for every part of your body. including eyes. ears. and teeth. Over 50 million Americans enjoy Medicare coverage. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Medicare. lets guarantee to 50 million Americans the health care they need in order to look into the eyes of the ones they love. to see our Fourth of July fireworks each year. and to hear it when freedom rings.
1140063747,Mr. Chairman. my amendment would increase the number of Federal Reserve Districts from 12 to 15. The three new districts would be for northern California. southern California. and Florida. based in San Francisco. Los Angeles. and Orlando. No current Federal Reserve banks would be relocated as a result. Take a look at the map to my right and you will see a map that is over a century old. The Federal Reserve Districts have not been updated significantly since they were first established in 1913102 years ago. It is time to bring our Federal Reserve Districts into the 21st century. Right now. for instance. one district represents everywhere from Utah to the Pacific Ocean. including Alaska and Hawaii. The three new districts would be centered in three of the fastest growing regions of our country in terms of both population and economic growth. In 1913. the 12th district. based in San Francisco. had only 6 percent of the population of the United States. In 2000. it had 19 percent. or 65 million Americans. As you can see from the next chart. districts designed originally a century ago to have equal population have reached the point where one district has 10 times the population of another district. In the case of the Western district. it now includes a total of nine States jumbled together. California and eight surrounding States. Similarly. the district including Florida and the neighboring States has grown to 45 million Americanstwice the average. It combines Florida and five neighboring States. It is time for the Fed to recognize this change in where Americans live. A similar change has been made in the court systems over the year. The tenth circuit was taken out of the eighth circuit when the population increased to the point where it was no longer sustainable as a single circuit court. Similarly. the llth circuitmy circuitwas carved out of the fifth circuit for exactly the same reason. But the Fed districts have remained static now for a century. I am proud to introduce this amendment to modernize the Federal Service to more accurately reflect who we are as Americans and where we live and where we work. I yield to the gentlewoman from California .
1140086558,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to discuss something that may not otherwise be discussed this year in this Congress: the wretched state of racial relations in America today. We passed a bill here about a month ago in the House of Representatives to eliminate the term ""Oriental"" from the law books. I submit that eliminating a term does not eliminate the racism that embodies that term. and I think it is about time that we recognize what this problem is. the fact that it still festers in America. and give some thought to what we can do about it. I want to begin by relating two stories. both from my home State of Florida. The first one involves a 16yearold girl. She was White. She had an encounter with police officers who were also White. She lived on the Atlantic Coast. which is largely White. and I heard about this from a friend of a friend. What happened to her is that her parents got a call from the police officers late one night. They didnt tell her why they were calling. but they said: You have to come to this location. We need to talk to you about your daughter. She is here with us. The mother went to that location. spoke to the White police officers. They informed her that her daughter had been drinking in a car with her boyfriend. and they needed to take her home. She was shaken up a bit. so was the daughter. but everybody ended that night alive. Now I want to tell you a different story. It didnt end so nicely. This was on the Gulf Coast. the coast of Florida that is heavily African American. and on the Gulf Coast one night there was a theme park. you could call it a fairgrounds. that was open to all students without having to pay. They could go on the rides. enjoy themselves one day each year. This is done in Tampa. Now. teenagers being teenagers. some of them got a little bit out of hand. Many African Americans frequent that area. and they were out in force that night at the fairgrounds. There was a great deal of friction that night between the White police force and the African American teenagers who were there that night. Some of them actually started running around. might have bumped into a few other people as they were running around. Someone started to scream. You will notice that apart from that physical contact. nothing I described is actually against the law. like. for instance. drinking in a car with your boyfriend when you are 16 years old. A number of them. about a hundred African American youths. were arrested that night 2 years ago in Tampa. The White police officers insisted that they strip to the waist. That apparently was for the purpose. in the minds of the police officers. to see whether they had gang colors on their bodiesat least. that is what they said. Now. one of them. Andrew Joseph III. actually hadnt done any of that running around. any of that screaming. any of that casual bumping. He hadnt done any of that. but he saw his classmates being arrested. He came to see what was going on. He saw that one of them had his hat fall off his head. He went over and he picked it up. The officer said: I didnt say you could do that. They arrested him for picking up his friends hat. They took Andrew Joseph. a 14yearold boy. 2 miles away from the fairgrounds. and they pushed him out of the police car and said: You are on your own. A 14yearold boy who has parents who were reachable by a telephone. they pushed him out in a neighborhood he had never seen before. never been to before. had no idea where he was. He remembered that his father was going to pick him up at the fairgrounds. He felt pretty shaken up because he had just been arrested and was told to strip to the waist and. frankly. felt humiliated. He found his way. as best he could. back to the fairgrounds 2 miles away. He didnt call his parents because. frankly. he was scared. embarrassed. didnt want them to know. He almost got as far as the fairgrounds. He tried to cross the interstate highway to get to the fairgrounds. In the midst of traffic in both directions. he was struck by a car and died right on the spot. immediately. One 16yearold girl. White. alive today. one 14yearold boy. African American. dead. This is his picture. Andrew Joseph III. This is what this boy looked like. He was a good student. quite an athlete. had a wonderful future ahead of him. But not being White. his parents didnt get a call that night to say to come pick him up. I submit to you. this is not just one persons tragedy. It is not just the tragedy of these parents standing at his gravesite. It is the tragedy of America. We persist in being a country of sometimes casual racism. racism that sometimes goes unnoticed. If you say a bad word that begins with the letter N and there happens to be a recording device nearby. you will certainly be scolded and to some degree held accountable. that much is true. But institutionalized racism. racial profiling. redlining is not treated the same way because it is just too hard. It is much like the concept that. if we close our eyes to it. it will somehow disappear. A 1yearold. maybe a 2yearold might think that way. but a country of 330 million. why do we ever think that way? Now. I wish I could tell you that the story somehow had a happy ending. It doesnt. This kind of institutionalized racism goes on today. I asked the FBI to investigate whether there is racial profiling by the police force in Tampa. They are thinking about it. I dont know if they are going to say yes or they are going to say no. I cant tell for sure. That is their decision. not mine. I remember when I was a boy. a great man said he hoped to see a day in America where his four children were judged not by the color of their skin but by their character. I submit to you. this boy was judged by the color of his skin. and he is not the only one. We live in an America today. a country where 29 percent of White adults have college degrees. 18 percent of African Americans have college degrees. If Andrew Joseph III had lived. then his chance of getting a college degree would have been stunted. perhaps even forbidden. by the color of his skin. Now. if he had lived. whether or not he had gone to college. he would have grown up in a country where African Americans like him have an average household income of $37.000. Whites have an average income of $57.000. The color of his skin. you could say. if he lived. would have cost him $20.000 a year. That is our new poll tax. $20.000 a year. If he had managed to get across that highwayI imagine him being picked up safely by his father that night. whom you see here on my rightthen. as an African American male. his life expectancy would have been 73 years. The life expectancy of White males in this country. including me. is 78 years. Now. it is a great tragedya great. great tragedythat we stole 50 years of life from this one boy. but how much greater tragedy is it that we steal 5 years of life from 40 million? We are in danger at this point of becoming a society that is not colorblind. not blind to color. but. rather. a country that is blind to racism. There is an easy way to end this problem. It is called doing something about it. It is called pulling ourselves together in the same way that we began to do in the 1960s: acknowledging these differences. and then remedying them. I well recall that in the current Presidential election. the former Governor of my State. Jeb Bush. spent $125 million on his campaign and got four votesfour votes. convention votes. But I remember that it never came up that Jeb Bush wiped out. destroyed. eliminated. blew up affirmative action in my State of Floridaand now it is gone. So the question before us is. writ small: How do we acknowledge that Black lives matter? How do we acknowledge that a terrible tragedy took place here and robbed this good young man of his life? And. writ large. what do we finally dofinally. finally. finally50 years after the civil rights movement began. to end inequality in this country. end it? It starts with justice. and it ends with equality. Not just the pablum of equality of opportunity. that buzz phrase that we use in order to solve our consciences. but. rather. the equality of results: an America where an African American boy is just as likely to go to college as a White boy. an America where an African American is just as likely to earn as much money as a White. and. for Gods sake. an African American can live as long as a White man does. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140090628,Mr. Chairman. my amendment would ensure that first responders are included for membership on the Pain Management Best Practices Interagency Task Force. This is a commonsense amendment. First responders. like police officers and other emergency room staff. are the first on the scene when a person overdoses. And they are the first to administer emergency treatments and resuscitation programs. These are the people who have the first contact with victims of opioid overdose. It would make sense that if we are putting together a task force to address the terrible opioid problemand specifically pain management best practiceswe should include the views and opinions of those who are first on the scene and in the best position to save lives. Being first on the scene to overdose emergencies. first responders often interact with patients in pain. Yet. most first responders. especially EMS responders. have no pain management standards as part of their accreditation. The Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services does not include a pain management standard as part of its clinical assessment. nor is pain management a major part of EMS education. As a result. first responder attitudes vary. According to a 2012 Yale study. there is a widespread reluctance within the EMS community to administer opioids to those who legitimately need it out of a fearperhaps unfoundedthat patients could be addicts seeking drugs. First responders certainly do encounter people who are not prescription painkiller dependent. However. it is often not possible for paramedics to know with certainty if a patient is an addict or even whether the addict is also experiencing legitimate pain. This level of uncertainty and varying degrees of attitudes within the first responder community. along with the unique experience and insight into the opioid epidemic. warrants the inclusion of first responders to the Pain Management Best Practices Interagency Task Force membership. Mr. Chairman. this is very simple. we are putting together a Pain Management Best Practices Interagency Task Force. We should include police officers. We should include paramedics. We should include people who are on the front lines of fighting this battle every day that is a battle of life and death. I urge the support of my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140105202,Mr. Chair. this language strikes the antiabortion language in section 613. which restricts abortion coverage for those who participate in Federal Employees Health Benefit plans. In other words. Federal employees. Singling out abortion care and requiring its exclusion from health insurance plans is discrimination. Federal employees commit their lives to public service. and they should not be penalized because of the source of their health insurance and who their employer happens to be. Government employees contribute to the cost of their coverage. and they pay their outofpocket expenses. They deserve the same benefits and access to comprehensive health care as those in the private sector. This ban separates public servants from privatesector employees and treats them as unequal. All Federal employees should have equal access to health care that other employees receive in the private sector. Here. we are saying that one employer. the government. is free to deny care to its employees. something that we would generally not allow in the private sector. We are also prohibiting these Federal employee plans from covering abortions. and that constitutes political interference in a womans personal decisionmaking. Restricting abortion coverage in these plans is a bad policy that harms women. Sometime during the course of pregnancy. for instance. one might find out that the fetus is abnormal. That is a personal decision whether to terminate that pregnancy or not that should be made personally. and the government should not weigh in in one way or another in making that decision. If a woman does decideeither because her life is threatened or because of fetal abnormalities or some other reasonthat she wants to terminate the pregnancy. she could be looking at tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars of unreimbursed health expenses. We shouldnt pretend that we are covering peoples health coverage needs while allowing them to fall subject to a bill that could be tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now. lifting this ban does not mandate abortion coverage. It simply permits the Federal Employees Health Benefit plans to cover abortions. I think we need to get to the heart of the matter. which is this: the most fundamental right of anyone. a man or a woman. is the right to control your own body. and that includes a womb. If liberty means anything. if freedom means anything. that is what it means. That is true for me and it is true for you. It is true for men. and it is true for women. and that includes pregnant women and women who happen to be Federal employees. Abortion has to be fully legal or women are not fully equal. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.

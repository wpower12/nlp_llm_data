1130003830,Mr. Speaker. this past Sunday when I turned 70 years of age. I read in the North Carolina paper. known as the News and Observer. the article that I would like to quote: More than 100 family members. friends and uniformed servicemembers marched slowly and quietly Friday down a hill at Arlington National Cemetery following Army Sergeant Aaron X. Wittmans coffin. draped with an American flag and carried on a horsedrawn caisson. Mr. Speaker. there are probably not many Members of Congress or Americans who know that Sergeant Wittman became the first American to lose his life in Afghanistan in 2013. I do not know how many more Americans will have to die between now and the end of 2014. One American life is already one too many. We have done enough in Afghanistan. It will never change. as history has proven time and time again. Obviously. there is nothing more important than an American life. But there is a second part of this sad situation. and that is the $28 million a day we are spending to rebuild Afghanistan. We could use that $28 million a day to fix our own roads and our own schools right here in America. Yesterday on CSPAN. I heard the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction. John Sopko. speak about how much money we are spending in Afghanistan and the fact that it is impossible to give the American taxpayers an account of where the money is going. I think Mr. Sopko and his team are doing the best they can. but taxpayers are still being shortchanged. especially with the looming issue of sequestration and a pending continuing resolution. I hope that my colleagues in the House can join in the effort to bring our troops home by the end of 2013 and to put an end to the wasteful spending in Afghanistan. Most importantly. above all else. put an end to the loss of American lives. I will quote from my friend. former commandant of the United States Marine Corps: What do you say to the mother. father. wife of the last soldier or marine killed in Afghanistan? My question is. Was it worth it? My answer is. No. not one life is worth it to be lost in Afghanistan. It is time to bring our troops home. Mr. Speaker. this poster beside me shows a casket on top of a caisson getting ready to walk to the grave at Arlington National Cemetery. May God continue to bless our troops. our men and women in uniform. May God continue to bless America. And please. God. touch the hearts of those in the House and lets bring our troops home in 2013.
1130014195,"Mr. Speaker. on April 8. which was 2 days ago. 13 years ago. 19 marines crashed and burned in Marana. Arizona. It was a very tragic time. The Osprey. Mr. Speaker. is the plane that goes from a helicopter mode to a plane mode. At the time of the accident. it was actually in an experimental phase. Two years after the accidentI was here at the time the accident took placeI received a letter from the wife of Brooks Gruber. Hes on my far left. He was the copilot. At the time of the accident. Colonel John Brow was flying the plane. The sad thing about it is why they had 19 marines on the back. The families do not know. And quite frankly. the former commandant of the Marine Corps during the time of this accident. General Jim Jones. not a relation to me. but I think the world of him. he said to me. I dont know why in the world they did not have sacks of weight in the back instead of those 17 marines sitting back there. Mr. Speaker. the problem is the lawsuits are over. Ive spoken to the lawyer in Texas. Jim Furman. himself a helicopter pilot during the Vietnam war. and he represented the families of Connie Gruber and Trish Brow. In addition. Brian Alexander of New York represented 17 families. Mr. Speaker. I always believe thisI might be wrong because Im not an attorneythat when a substantial settlement is made. then somebody was seen as being at fault. The press release has created the problem. On July 27 of the year 2000. in the release. they make reference to a combination of human factors that caused the April 8 accident. Further stated by Marine Corps Commandant General James Jones: The tragedy is that these were all good marines joined in a challenging mission. Unfortunately. the pilots drive to accomplish that mission appears to have been the fatal factor. What the family and myself have been battling for since the year 2000 is that the experts have said that the pilots did not understand vortex ring state and how it impacts the V22. Vortex ring state is understood in most helicopters. but the V22 was new. and they had not done any testing at all. Mr. Speaker. I want to read the paragraph from Connie Gruber when she asked me to look into this. This was dated December 10 of 2002: With so many wrongs in the world we cannot make right. I ask that you prayerfully consider an injustice that you can help make right. I realize you alone may not be able to amend the report. but you can certainly support my efforts to permanently remove this black mark from my husbands honorable military service record. Military leaders continue to refuse to amend this report. but I am certain there must be other means of making this change. Given the controversy of this aircraft and the Marine Corps vested interest. surely there is an unbiased. ethical way to rightfully absolve these pilots. Please help me by not only forwarding my request but by also supporting it. When I received that letter from Mrs. Gruber. I called and told her that I am a strong man of faith. and there was some reason that God put my name in her letter and that I would do everything I could to clear the names of Colonel John Brow and Major Brooks Gruber. Im not a pilot. Mr. Speakerand I dont knowbut I cannot really understand being a pilot or a copilot in a situation where you have not been trained. where you didnt understand the vortex ring state and how it would impact the V22 and what you should do. Thats the fault of the United States Marine Corps. and thats the fault of BellBoeing. Again. the lawsuits are settled. and BellBoeing settled for big bucks. if I can say it that way. I want to give you just another idea. I have talked to so many people in 10 years that sometimes it gets confusing. but I think what Im going to read. Mr. Speaker. probably tells the story as well as anything. Its from a publication called ""V22: Wonder Weapon or Widow Maker."" Ill read: That the tests addressing flying qualities and a phenomenon called ""vortex ring state"" were reduced from 103 mandated test conditions to the 33 actually flown represents a cancellation of almost 68 percent of the tests in this key area. including the crucial two at 20 and 40 knots at high gross weight specifically applicable in this accident. This article further states: That aircrews were tasked with participating in that April 8 night operation without benefit of such highly relevant test results and experience represents realand what some might label criminalnegligence on the part of those NAVAIR and Marine Corps leaders who knew both the parameters of the missing tests and the nature of this nighttime exercise. Without this prior testing experience. data and subsequent analysis. these pilots should not have been flying such a mission. Mr. Speaker. what makes this so ironic is that. as Ive shared with you. Im in my 12th year of trying to get a letter from the United States Marine Corps that clearly statesand the facts support thisthat Colonel John Brow. pilot. and Major Brooks Gruber. copilot. were not prepared to handle vortex ring state in the V22 Osprey. Thats all the wives want. You would think that we were going to be sued or something. Ive got letters from the lawyers who say. No more suits. Its over. Trish has two young boys. Michael and Matthew. and Connie has a little girl who is just as precious as she can be. Its just one of those things that. as a man of faith. you just wonder: Where is the guilt of those who ordered that mission that night? It made no sense. Dick Cheney was opposed to the Osprey. and he was really trying to scrap the program. He was Secretary of Defense at the time. So the Marine Corps ordered a mission where these three planes would go to Marana. Arizona. and they would play that they were going to recapture some Americans being held by terrorists. Really. sometimes you just wonder: Where is the heart? Where is the feeling? These gentlemen. truthfully. were known as two of the best Osprey pilots that the Marine Corps had at that time. By the way. Mr. Speaker. I actually contacted the three marine investigators for the JAGMAN report. That is the official evaluation of the accident. Major Phil Stackhouse. Colonel Ron Radish. and Colonel Mike Morgan have all given me letters in the last year. Each one clearly states that nothing in the JAGMAN report should indicate that the pilots did anything in a deliberate way. because the pilots had not been trained. BellBoeing. after being sued. hired an experimental test pilot. Tom MacDonald. who is pretty well known in the area of planes. Tom MacDonald spent 700 hours studying one issue: What happens when the V22 gets in the vortex ring state? In 700 hours. he discovered how they should handle it. and he received a national award known as the Kincheloe. Ive talked to a lot of people in the 12 years on this issue. and the one thing that God has allowed me to understand is that His children deserve to be cleared. I am hopeful. We have back and forth sent a letter that the Marine Corps is reviewing and that the two wives have said they would be satisfied with. and our hope is that sometime in the next few weeks we will get that letter. I will go to the Secretary of Defense. Chuck Hagel. whom I know and have a friendship with. and I will ask him to assign someone on his immediate staff to work with me on this issue. I hope that the Marine Corps understands that I do not want to do that. because it would bring more peace to Trish and Connie if the Marine Corps writes the letter. Again. were probably talking about at most three sentences. Trish has said. for the public. I do not want my children. Michael and Matthew. to go on Google and read that pilot error was the cause of this accident on April 8 of 2000. Quite frankly. Mr. Speaker. that is what would happen if any of us on this floor tonight Googled ""Osprey"" and ""April 8."" you would see that. It indicates it was pilot error. Sometimes I have some kids in my office. as I did today from my district. some 4Hers. and they were asking about the things that a Member of Congress gets involved in. And I said not everything we get involved in should be or needs to be in the press. Some things that we get involved in. its simply because our heart tells us that if you dont do it. who is going to do it? Whos going to do it if you. Congressman WALTER JONES. dont take it up? I hope and pray that John Brow and Brooks Gruber and the 17 marines in the back will be able to rest in peace. Mr. Speaker. Voltaire said: We owe the living respect. we owe the dead the truth. Thats all were asking. is that these two marines can rest in peace. Mr. Speaker. I have said if this comes to be a reality. that I want to go to the gravesJohn is buried in Arlingtonwith his wife and their two boys. and say. Colonel Brow. its over. Then with Major Gruber. with his wife and little girlhes buried in Jacksonvilleis to go with them and say. Sleep. youre not at fault. Sleep. Mr. Speaker. I apologize for getting emotional. but I just feel so passionate about this. With that. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130023137,"Mr. Speaker. thank you very much. I am back on the floor again to talk about the failed policy in Afghanistan. This poster beside me. Mr. Speaker. is a cartoon that I got from the paper. and it says. ""CIA ATM."" Mr. Speaker. 2 weeks ago. The New York Times broke an article. a story that the CIA. over the last 10 years. has been giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Karzai. and I want to quote what Karzai said in that article. Karzai said he was assured that the CIA would continue delivering bags of cashbags of cashgoing to Karzai. the corrupt leader. in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker. what really makes this cartoon sad is in the background is an American soldier. and what he is thinking as Karzai is taking his cash money away from the CIA ATM machine. the solder is thinking. ""Id like @D Printed on recycled paper. to make a quick withdrawal from here."" I hope that during the debate in July on the appropriations bill dealing with the Defense Department that we will start passing amendments that say we need to stop this outofcontrol spending in Afghanistan with very little accountability. I am one that agrees with my party and some of the Democrats that we need to hold hearings on Benghazi and the Internal Revenue Service. But I have written to the leadership of the Armed Services Committee and the subcommittee chairmen asking for a hearing on this outofcontrol waste in Afghanistan. Not only did the CIA acknowledge that they have been giving tens of millions of dollars in cash to Karzai for 10 years. but. Mr. Speaker. we are also authorizing $8 billion a month to go to Afghanistan. We are holding no hearings on the waste. fraud. and abuse in Afghanistan. I hope that after we get through the appropriations process that we will start holding hearings. Its not fair to the American people that we borrow money from China to send to Karzai in Afghanistan. And. Mr. Speaker. we all know that Karzai is not going to survive. The Taliban. whom we are fighting. who are killing Americans today. will be the future leaders of Afghanistan. Every expert that Ive spoken to. military and nonmilitary. has said that the Taliban. which primarily is made up of Pashtunsthats the largest tribe of Afghanistanin time. they will be the leaders of Afghanistan. It is time for this Congress to wake up and join the American people. Seventyfive percent of the American people say. We want out of Afghanistan. We want to bring our troops home. We want to stop wasting money. So. Mr. Speaker. before I close. I would also like to reiterate this cartoon. Its Karzai standing at a CIA ATM machine. Hes got bags of cash down at his feet. and the little guy has a credit card that hes going to put into the machine. like we all do here in America to get money from our own accounts. But hes not getting it from his own account. hes getting it from the CIA account. And then I see this poor soldier standing behind him whos saying. ""Id like to make a quick withdrawal from here."" Mr. Speaker. I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform. I ask God to hold in His arms those families whove given a child dying for freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. I ask God to please bless the House and Senate. that we will do what is right in the eyes of God. I ask God to please bless the President. that he will do what is right in the eyes of God. And three times I will ask. God. please. God. please. God. please continue to bless America."
1130057125,Mr. Speaker. I am on the floor today in remembrance of the bombing of the United States Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. Lebanon. 30 years ago. On October 23. 1983. at approximately 6:20 in the morning. a truck packed with explosives broke security and detonated outside of the barracks. killing 241 Americans and wounding 128 more. Mr. Speaker. I believe it is appropriate that. on the 30th anniversary of this act of terrorism. we recognize the sacrifice of the individuals who lost life and limb. and join with the families and friends of the victims in mourning their loss. Furthermore. I believe that we should learn from the example of Americas leader at the time of the bombing. President Ronald Reagan. President Reagan appreciated the sacrifice made by our servicemembers and was deeply pained by the loss of life. While many other Presidents would have continued sacrificing young men and women for the sake of the mission in Lebanon. President Reagan acknowledged his mistake. I would like to take a moment to read a statement he made regarding the bombing: Perhaps we didnt appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the Middle East such a jungle. Perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to Paradise was so foreign to our own values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have. In the weeks immediately after the bombing. I believed the last thing we should do was to turn tail and leave. Yet the irrationality of Middle East politics forced us to rethink our policy. If there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die. we would be a lot better off. If that policy had changed toward more of a neutral position and neutrality. those 241 marines would be alive today. I have read these quotes from President Reagan to honor the sacrifice of the 241 marines and their families. They did not die in vain. but gave their lives to bring peace to a troubled area. The leaders of our country must learn from tragedies like Beirut that our men and women in uniform are very precious. Our foreign policy must be formed with a better understanding of the commitment and purpose in a mission before we risk the life of one single American. I believe sincerely that this was the point President Reagan was making as he remarked with remorse on the bombing of the marine barracks in Beirut. Lebanon. on October 23 of 1983. Mr. Speaker. I have the privilege to represent Camp Lejeune Marine Base and other bases in eastern North Carolina. and I have visited the Beirut memorial many times to look at the names. certainly people I never knew and probably would not have known. But the point is that our foreign policy continues today in Afghanistan. We have had six Americans killed in the last week. In the bill that passed recently to raise the debt ceiling. there was $30 billion for Karzai. who is a crook. I do not understand this Congress. why we continue to sacrifice our young men and women. and why we continue to send money that we do not have to a foreign dictator and we cut programs 9 Printed on recycled paper. for children and seniors who want to have a meal. With that. Mr. Speaker. in closing. I honor the 241 who died by saying I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform. to please bless the families of our men and women in uniform. And Dear God. I ask You to continue to bless America.
1130083269,"Madam Speaker. last week in a hearing of the Armed Services Committee. we listened to the concerns of Army Secretary John McHugh and Chief of Staff of the Army. General Ray Odierno. They appeared before the committee to tell us about the serious problems facing the United States Army. specifically. the difficult budget situation the Army is currently facing. It was my intention to ask the following question regarding the funding that is being cut from the Army: Why are we continuing to spend billions of dollars in Afghanistan when the money could be going to support our servicemembers? As I did last week. I would like to read a short paragraph from the World Affairs Journal entitled. ""Money Pit: The Monstrous Failure of U.S. Aid to Afghanistan."" The article states that. in 2012. the United States budgeted $11.2 billion for Afghan military training. with another $5.8 billion for 2013. The article goes on to say: In Afghanistan. a big problem is illiteracy. Almost 3 years ago. when Lieutenant General William B. Caldwell IV. took command of the NATO training mission. he noted that ""overall literacy"" among Afghan military and police stood ""at about 14 percent."" How can an illiterate policeman read a license plate. the General asked. how can a soldier fill out a form. read an equipment manual? Now. even though these concerns have been on the table for years. the special inspector general for Afghan reconstruction said in last summers report: The literacy rate of Afghan security forces as a whole is 11 percent. Again. I want to repeat that. in 2012. the United States budgeted $11.2 billion for Afghan military training. with another $5.8 billion for 2013. Madam Speaker. for the United States to continue funding these Afghan security forces would be a mistake. It would put our servicemembers lives in danger. and it would waste the American peoples hardearned tax dollars. Why are we. in Congress. not putting a stop to this abuse. especially considering this money flows freely overseas with little to no accountability? Last Friday. I had the privilege of speaking to around 100 people at an event in my district. and truly. almost everyone agreed with me that spending money we do not have in Afghanistan is a waste. Every nation that has tried to govern Afghanistan has failed. and this is no exception. It is my hope. along with my colleague. JIM McGOVERN. who has continuously worked with me on this issue. that the House leadership will allow debate on this failed policy in Afghanistan this spring or summer. We need to take the money that we are spending overseas. and we need it to benefit our own security forces and the problems facing the American people here at home. When I look at the bridges and the potholes and education and other needs in America and we are cutting those programs. why do we continue to borrow billions of dollars from foreign governments to prop up the Afghan leadership? It is nothing but a failed policy. In closing. I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform. to please bless the families of our men and women in uniform. and I continue to ask God to continue to bless America."
1130093481,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. I could not agree more. How in the world can the Congress of the United States. which has an obligation to declare war. continue to abdicate its right to debate our young men and women going to Afghanistan to die? We have already spent over $1.5 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan. Iraq was an unnecessary war. The previous administration intentionally manufactured the justification. It was absolutely unnecessary. And all we are askingand that is why I will vote against the rule. There is much in this bill that I will vote for. But as the gentleman from Massachusetts says. this is a bipartisan amendment. I have signed over 11.000 letters to families and extended families who lost loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan. This past weekend I signed four letters. I am not trying to single myself out. but I feel the pain of my mistake of giving the authority to the previous President to bypass Congress to send our young men and women to die in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. MCGOVERN is right. If President Obama believes it is necessary in the next couple of years to increase the numbers. then let him come to Congress so that we can meet our constitutional responsibility and vote either ""yes"" or ""no."" and then. with pride. know that we did what the Constitution required. Next Wednesday. I will go to Walter Reed at Bethesda to see three marines who were severely injured in Afghanistan in the last month. I dont know how severely they are. It might be legs are gone. It might be brain injuries. Yet. we. in Congress. continue to abdicate our constitutional responsibility to these young men and young women. I will tell you that the marines down at Camp Lejeune and Cherry Point. which is in my district. are sick and tired of this involvement in Afghanistan. One last point. The former Commandant of the Marine Corps has been my adviser for the last 5 years on Afghanistan. and he has said: Why doesnt Congress understand history? You will never change Afghanistan. No matter how much blood or money you send to Afghanistan. you will never change it. I am disappointed in the Rules Committee. So many. and every one of them. Republican and Democrat. I have the greatest respect for. But not to allow us to debate whether a young man or young woman from America should die or lose their legs. their arms. or their mind is a disappointment and a failure of this House of Representatives not to follow the Constitution. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for the time."
1130106590,"Mr. Speaker. I am on the floor today because I believe that Congress must put an end to the waste of American lives and taxpayer dollars overseas. Recently. President Obama requested $500 million to train and arm Syrian rebels. In his editorial. ""Congress Can Stop Obamas Ramp Up to War."" Pat Buchanan made an excellent point. saying: Before Congress takes up his proposal. both Houses should demand that Obama explain exactly where he gets the constitutional authority to plunge us into what the President himself calls ""somebody elses civil war."" Buchanan goes on to comment: Syria has not attacked us. Syria does not threaten us. Why are we joining a jihad to overthrow the Syrian Government? Mr. Speaker. Iraq is another country in which America has again become involved to the detriment of our best interests. A former commandant of the Marine Corps. who has been my adviser for the past 6 years. stated in a recent email to me. ""We should not put boots on the ground."" He went on to say that the situation in Iraq is ""a Middle East issue that needs a Middle East solution."" not more American troops. Unfortunately. there are currently 750 American boots on the ground in Iraq. with authorization from the President for up to 770 in the future. As our involvement in Iraq escalates. I am reminded of another important point made by Pat Buchanan: It is astonishing that Republicans who threaten to impeach Obama for usurping authority at home remain silent as he prepares to usurp the war powers to march us into Syria and back into Iraq. Last August. Americans rose as one to tell Congress to deny Obama any authority to attack Syria. Are Republicans now prepared to sit mute as Obama takes us into two new Middle East wars on his own authority? Mr. Speaker. Marine Lieutenant General Greg Newbold wrote an insightful editorial for Time in April 2006. titled. ""Why Iraq Was a Mistake."" From 2000 until 2002. General Newbold was director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and describes himself as ""a witness and therefore a party to the actions that led us to the invasion of Iraqan unnecessary war."" In closing. I would like to quote a paragraph from General Newbolds editorial regarding the distortion of intelligence that drew America into the Iraq war in the first place: In 1971. the rock group The Who released the antiwar war anthem. titled. ""Wont Get Fooled Again."" To us. its lyrics evoked a feeling that we must never again stand by quietly while those ignorant of and casual about war lead us into another one and then mismanage the conduct of it. Never again. we thought. would our militarys senior leaders remain silent as American troops were marched off to an illconsidered engagement. Its 35 years later. and the judgment is in: The Who had it wrong. We have been fooled again. Those are sad. sad words. We have been fooled again. Mr. Speaker. we in Congress have the responsibility. based on the Constitution. to never get fooled again. but too many times we do not uphold our constitutional rights. I believe the words of Pat Buchanan and Greg Newbold articulate the many reasons that no President should bypass Congress and the Constitution to send our military into combat. Mr. Speaker. before closing. I have a photograph from the Greensboro NewsRecord. Here we go again in setting up our men and women in uniform that possibly could get killed in a foreign country. Mr. Speaker. this is a group of Army soldiers bringing a flagdraped coffin off of a plane. Please. God. dont let us forget that those in uniform are our children. and we must protect them by meeting our constitutional responsibility. With that. Mr. Speaker. I will ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform. please bless the families of our men and women in uniform. and please. God. continue to bless America."
1130111954,"Mr. Speaker. to begin my short statement today. I would like to read you a recent headline from The Washington Times: ""Golden Hammer: U.S. squandered $34 million on failed Afghan soybean project."" The first few sentences of this report read: ""Call it the great American soybean heist. the latest tale of U.S. taxpayer abuse to emanate from Afghanistan. Despite clear evidence that Afghanistans arid soil was a bad place to grow soybeans. the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent $34.4 million tying to establish the crop in that country. according to the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction."" Mr. Speaker. here we go again. talking about the waste. fraud. and abuse of American resources in Afghanistan. Yesterday I spoke on the House floor in memory of three members of the United States Army who died as a result of their service in Afghanistan. The deaths of these three men represent my greatest concern with our servicemembers continuing to remain in Afghanistan: that more and more of our men and women in uniform will be killed and wounded. The loss of life and limb is far more important than the money that is being wasted. However. Mr. Speaker. our country is in a dangerous financial situation. In addition to the soybean report. I want to read three more headlines that accentuate the waste of our taxpayer money in Afghanistan. From CBS News: ""Is the Pentagon wasting taxpayer money in Afghanistan?"" From the Center for Public Integrity: ""The U.S. military was no match for Afghanistans corruption."" And from the World Affairs Journal: ""Money pit: The monstrous failure of U.S. aid to Afghanistan."" Mr. Speaker. how much more can the poor American taxpayer continue to spend on a failed policy in Afghanistan? I cannot emphasize enough that we have children. senior citizens. and veterans here at home that desperately need our assistance. yet we run out of money for their programs because we refuse to make cuts to the funds that are being funneled overseas. and especially in Afghanistan. I say to the administration and to Congress that it is time to fix Americas problems. not Afghanistans problems. and not the worlds problems. In closing. Mr. Speaker. I want. again. to mention the three Army soldiers who were killed last week on July 25: Staff Sergeant Benjamin G. Prange. PFC Keith M. Williams. and PFC Donnell A. Hamilton. Jr. Mr. Speaker. beside me. I have poster after poster of the cost of war. As a young kid named Tyler Jordanthis is actually from 2003. our early days in Iraq. a very unnecessary warhis father was a gunny sergeant named Phillip Jordan. and he was killed. and here is Tyler being given the flag that was folded after it was taken off his fathers grave. I dont know how many of these three names I just mentionedI know one family. he had two little girls. maybe they got a folded flagbut it is time for Congress to wake up. There is no need to have our young men and women overseas giving their life and limb and to see the money wasted overseas in fraud. waste. and abuse when we can use it right here to fix Americas problems. Please. God. continue to bless our men and women in uniform. and please. God. continue to bless America."
1130119045,"I thank Ms. Foxx for putting this together. Tonight is a sad night. but a very special night. I think. for those of us who have had the privilege to know HOWARD COBLE as long as I have. We go back to 1983. when I was a freshman Democrat in the North Carolina House of Representatives and he was a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives as a Republican. Why we met. I dont know. but eventually we became pretty good friends at that point. He then left the North Carolina House and came to Washington. D.C.. and my father. Congressman Walter Jones. Sr.. was chairman of the Merchant Marine Committee. Mr. COBLE. who came from North Carolina. was on that committee because he is a former member of the Coast Guard. He was a natural because of the work they did on that committee. My father became a friend of HOWARD COBLEs. Then I came to Washington. Mr. Speaker. as a Republican. and we have been friends for many years. This man. to me. is very special as a human being. I heard Mr. PRICE say the ""dean."" but I call him the ""leadah"". 1eadah. Mr. COBLE likes to tell people that is because those of us from eastern North Carolina dont know the word ""leader"" ends in er instead of ah. I did that because at the time we became the majority in 1995. it was a change in the House. for sure. and there was a Democrat for a number of years. and Mr. COBLE. being the kind of man he was. said. ""No. I dont want to be called the dean. As long as hes here in Congress. I want him to remain the dean."" I think that says a heck of a lot about who this person is. So. Mr. Speaker. I decided that he should be known as the ""leadah."" and therefore many people in the House of Representatives from both parties call him the ""leadah""-some with a northern accent. some with a west coast accent. but it still sounds the same. For me. personally. this night is sad because I have spent many nights in the last few years where Mr. COBLE and I have had dinner together at the Capitol Hill Club reminiscing about yesterday but also thinking about today. For me. this is a personal relationship that is like family. quite frankly. For me to know that I have been reelected for another term and to know that Mr. COBLE will go back home and enjoy the love and affection of the people of Greensboro. it still is sad for me personally. I do think that he has given so much not only to the State of North Carolina. but to our Nation. He has been a very effective leader of the House. He has been a great legislator. He has been able to get things done in the Judiciary Committee and other committees. He will always be remembered in my heart as a member of my family. To you. HOWARD COBLE. I love you as a brother in Christ. You are a special man who has given so much to not only North Carolina. but to America. You will always remain a member of my family. God bless you. sir."

1130004257,Thank you for giving us the opportunity to rise today to honor a true American hero. who is Chris Kyle. a retired Navy SEAL chief petty officer who was killed in Glen Rose. Texas. on February 2. Chris Kyle heroically defended his country through four tours of duty in Iraq. where he participated in major battles throughout the country. He was the single deadliest sniper in the history of the United States military. Chief Kyle was shot twice in the fighting and was in six separate IED explosions. However. he never received the Purple Heart because he didnt want to be separated from his unit while the paperwork was being processed. Chris Kyle fought for his country and saved the lives of many of his fellow Americans. but his accomplishments extended far beyond the battlefield. After 10 years of service as a SEAL. Chris retired from the Navy to focus on his family. He continued to train military personnel and security staff. and he wrote a book documenting his time in combat. which one of the Members talked about. Rather than keep the proceeds from the sale of the book. he donated the money to the families of two fellow SEAL members who had fallen in battle. On February 2. Chris and his friend Chad Littlefield were tragically killed by a veteran they had sought to help. This act of violence may have taken Mr. Kyles life. but it doesnt erase the powerful legacy he leaves behind. Mr. Kyle is survived by his wife and two young children. He lives on through his family. through the lives he saved through his heroism in combat. and through the veterans he helped. He continues to be a source of inspiration to all who know his story. On February 11. more than 7.000 people from around the country gathered in Cowboy Stadium for Chris Kyles memorial service. Hundreds more braved bad weather to line roads and highways to honor Chris by watching his funeral procession on the way to the Texas State Cemetery. It was a fitting tribute to a man who touched the lives of so many and who will continue to do so even after his death. This country owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to Chris Kyle for his selfless service to his country. both on and off the battlefield. His heroism and the heroism of all his fellow veterans will never be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife. his children. his family and friends. and especially with his teammates.
1130057866,"I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me time. Madam Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to and celebrate the life of an outstanding public servant. Bill Young. It is a true honor to have been able to know a man like Chairman Young and to be able to call him both a friend and a role model for all of us. There is no one who was more respected. decent. gracious. dedicated and humble. Everyone who crossed his path is richer for the experience. That is evident through the hundreds of people who attended his memorial service last week. His service was attended by over 30 Members of Congress. During a time of such partisanship. the respect for Chairman Young was illustrated through the attendance from both sides of the aisle. including leadership. The respect the military has for his lifelong advocacy for our national security and for our servicemembers was evident through the attendance and heartfelt eulogies of former Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. General James Amos. It was clear that the Department of Defense depended on him. Immediately before the service began. General Amos bestowed a very rare and appropriate honor by naming Chairman Young an honorary marine. I will never forget when I was first appointed to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. As one of the first women ever to serve on the subcommittee. I wasnt sure how I would be treated. but Bill immediately brought me in and treated me with respect and kindness. as he did to everyone. Gender didnt matter to him. he only cared about my commitment to the military and to our Nation. When John Wooden wrote ""the true test of a mans character is what he does when no one is watching."" he clearly was talking about Chairman Young. Over the years. we have all heard many. many stories about the personal interest and assistance that he and Beverly provided for our wounded soldiers. but we never heard these stories from him. He never talked about what he did. He was motivated by doing what was right for someone elses health and wellbeing. When Marine Lance Corporal Josh Callihan spoke at the memorial service. it was the first time that most of us had ever heard about the extraordinary efforts the Chairman and Beverly took to help this wounded warrior. Lance Corporal Callihan had been shot in the back and sustained significant damage to his spinal cord. With no family support system. he was in Bethesda injured both physically and emotionally. Then he met Bill and Beverly Young. and his life changed forever. They stepped in and became his family. helping him to recover. Today. Josh calls the Chairman and Beverly .mom"" and ""dad."" After many years of hard work. he is now married and expecting his first child. According to Josh. none of this would be possible without Bill Young. As I was thinking about what I wanted to say about Chairman Young. I realized it was impossible to do justice to such an extraordinary man merely through words. He was truly one of a kind. The best way we can honor this man is to redouble our efforts to our national security and to the treatment of our servicemembers and their families. I ask that all of my colleagues join me to make sure that we carry on his legacy. In closing. I want to let Beverly. their children. his friends and his staff. who were part of his family. know that you all remain in our thoughts and our prayers."
1130092434,"Mr. Speaker. I have been looking forward to this day ever since I first learned about the greatest untold story of World War II. and that was 8 years ago. For me. my journey with the Monuments Men began at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth. Texas. in 2006 when I met Robert Edsel. who had just published his first book. ""Rescuing Da Vinci."" and who later wrote ""The Monuments Men: Allied Heros. Nazi Thieves. and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History."" It was that evening when I realized how critical these men and women were in preserving European cultural history and how remarkable their task was during the Second World War. While death and destruction surrounded them. their mission was the complete opposite: to protect cultural treasures so far as war allowed. This special military unit was tasked with helping to locate works of art confiscated by the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. The Monuments Men and women were able to locate. preserve. and return almost 5 million cultural items. including many of the worlds greatest works of art. Today. there are only six surviving membersfive men and one womanof the Monuments Men. As Memorial Day approaches. I believe the veterans who participated in these daring missions are certainly worthy and deserving of the recognition of Congress highest expression of appreciation. Mr. Speaker. the medal authorized in this bill will be given to the Smithsonian for safekeeping and available for display. as well as available for loan as appropriate. In my view and that of many other Members. one very appropriate place would be the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. which is building a permanent exhibit on the Monuments Men and expected to open in 2016. Before I close. there are several people I want to thank who helped make this possible: of course. Robert Edsel for uncovering this story and sharing it with the world. Congressman MICHAEL CAPUANO for sponsoring this legislation with me. Congressman STEVE COHEN for his tireless efforts to help build the support needed to bring this bill to the floor for a vote. I also want to thank Senators RoY BLUNT and ROBERT MENENDEZ for taking the lead on this bill in the Senate. While we can never say thank you enough. I believe the Congressional Gold Medal is a worthy token of appreciation from a grateful nation to these members of the Greatest Generation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation."
1130112986,"Thank you. Mr. Chairman. for yielding. Madam Speaker. as we speak. unaccompanied minors continue to be sent from Central America through drug cartel smuggling networks across Mexico and through our southern border. Families are being lied to and manipulated by the coyotes. The $6.000 their families spend to send their children to the United States goes into the bank account of the most powerful drug cartels in the world. Since October. over 58.000 unaccompanied children have made the dangerous journey to the United States. and many more will continue to come unless we send a clear message that they will not be allowed to stay in the United States. I have seen firsthand the crisis that has unfolded at the southern border in places like the Rio Grande Valley and south Texas. I have seen the women and children sleeping on the floor of a bus station in Laredo. I have seen motherless infants being cared for by any stranger who is around. I have seen the children who are alone in detention facilities in McAllen. Texas. and I have seen the 1.200 children who are being sheltered at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. andmost disturbing of allI have heard the stories about the most Godawful journey anyone should ever have to experience. We are here today because we have a responsibility to stop this crisis. The President has failed to lead. so I firmly believe this Chamber must act. Doing nothing is not an option. Since June. when the Speaker asked me to lead a working group to provide policy recommendations on what we can do to address the crisis. I have been to the TexasMexico border twice and led a codel to Guatemala and Honduras. to see where the children are coming from and why. I will be returning to the border tomorrow for a third time. The members of the working group dove headfirst into this issue to understand this crisis and provide recommendations for a shortterm. immediate response. The policies we recommended are not an attempt for immigration reform. They are serious solutions to address this crisis. I want to take a moment to recognize the hard work of the members of the working group who have made policy recommendations to the conference and the expertise they brought to the table. I want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. BOB GOODLATTE. chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. MICHAEL MCCAUL. chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. JOHN CARTER. chairman of the Western Hemisphere Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. MATT SALMON. Congressman STEVE PEARCE from the Financial Services Committee. and MARIO DIAzBALART from the Appropriations Committee. One of our conclusions from the last several weeks is that Congress should not provide more resources to the administration without changing the policies that have led us to the situation we are in today. Administration officials and officials in the Central American countries have all said that we have to make changes to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. A month ago. it appeared there was a bipartisan consensus forming on this issue. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said from the White House podium just 3 weeks ago. when discussing changes to the 2008 law. that it is ""a priority of this administration. and if you listen to the public comments of Democrats and Republicans. it sounds like its a bipartisan priority."" I agree. and it is disappointing that the White House has backed down from their original statements on how we can immediately address this issue. We are not asking for a repeal of this law. We are saying we need to tweak the 2008 law so that all unaccompanied minors are treated the same as Mexican and Canadian children for removal purposes. The policy changes included in this bill ensure that children receive a prompt hearing within 7 days after they are detained and require that a judge rules no later than 72 hours after a hearing. Accelerating the hearing times requires more judges. I thank the chairman for including the necessary funding to hire 40 temporary judges until this crisis is under control. For repatriations. we are prioritizing last infirst out. That means the last child to go into United States Government custody will be the first one we send home. After families have spent between $6.000 and $9.000 to send their children here. this will send a strong message to the families in the countries of origin that their children will not be permitted to stay. This is a message of deterrence. I also note that Chairman ROGERS has prioritized funding for Central American countries to safely and humanely return these children. working with these countries as we return their children. as they have asked us to do. With the surge of children. there has been increased pressure on our Customs and Border Protection officials. This supplemental deploys the National Guard to assist hightraffic States. This will free up the Border Patrol to focus on their mission."

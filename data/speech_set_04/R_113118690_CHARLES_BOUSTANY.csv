1130035428,Madam Chair. this is a fiscally responsible bill. It cuts $2.9 billion below the fiscal year 2013 enacted level and it is $4.1 billion below the Presidents request. That is an impressive achievement working in this very difficult fiscal environment that we are in today. What I really find impressive about the bill and the work thats been done by the subcommittee chairman and the chairman and the Appropriations Committee is the fact that this bill sets some very good priorities. In fact. there is $2 billion for navigation projects and studies to advance American competitiveness in our ability to export. which is critical for growth in the U.S. economy. It includes $1 billion of appropriation from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. This is a record level. This is $200 million more than what we saw in fiscal year 2013. something that is absolutely critical. because we know that our Federal ports. our harbors. are essential if we are going to be able to ship goods overseas. Getting the dredging funds is absolutely necessary because we lose economic efficiency. In fact. on the Mississippi River. every time we lose a foot of draft it is about $1 million per ship. per day. in lost economic activity. If we are going to get this economy growing. create value. create jobs. we have to export. To export. we have to have the waterways that allow us to do that. According to the Army Corps of Engineers. nearly 1.000 Federal ports and harbors have not been adequately maintained due to inadequate budgetary allocations over time. This bill now takes a strong step forward to correct that. I want to thank Chairman ROGERS for this encouraging step forward for bringing attention to the fact that Americas infrastructureits ports. its locks. its dams. its inland waterwaysare old and have not received the appropriate investment and have often been ignored. It has cost us time. it has cost us money. it has cost us economic growth. and it has cost us jobs. Clearly. if we are expanding these trade agreements. looking at the Pacific with the TransPacific Partnership. looking at a transatlantic agreement. we have to have our ports. our harbors. our waterways working at maximum efficiency if we are going to grow this economy. Also. I want to compliment the chairman of the subcommittee and full committee as well for including language from my colleague. Congressman RODNEY ALEXANDER. This is language included in the bill requiring the Department of Energy to report on its plans to address the backlog of natural gas export applications. liquefied natural gas export applications. and to encourage the timely completion of this approval process. Given the fact that so many of these applicants have been waiting for well over a year to get a decision from the Department of Energy. it is just unacceptable to have this kind of a backlog at a time when this is going to help us expand trade. help improve our trade deficit. it will help create jobs. it will help us withactually. interestingly. help stabilize the price of natural gas so we will see more drilling. and help our energy security in the longrun. So expediting this process. getting the Department of Energy to be held to account on the backlog of these permits is critically important because these companies have invested millions of dollars in this permitting process. To be sitting in limbo is just simply unacceptable. I am very. very happy that Congressman ALEXANDERs language has been included in this base bill. and I want to thank the chairman for doing this. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130057416,Mr. Chair. I rise today to express my frustration. For many of us. the 2007 WRDA bill included the authorization for critical projects in our districts. Since the passage of that bill. the Army Corps of Engineers have begun interpreting the language and technical errors came to light. Last night. through the Rules process. I attempted to right 2 exact wrongs by making technical corrections to the specific language in the 2007 WRDA bill with 2 precise amendments at no additional cost to the American taxpayer. One of my amendments would have made a necessary technical change to the language of the Southwest Coastal Louisiana Feasibility Study to include the entire city of Delcambre. LA. As the study perimeters are currently written. they include only areas within 3 particular Parishes. However. there is one community. the city of Delcambre. LA that is divided by the Vermilion Parish line with half of the city and its structures in Vermilion. thus covered by the study. and the other half in Iberia Parish. not covered in the study. As the Corps began to move forward with study implementation. they made the decision to essentially cut the community. and structures. in half. This is not a sensible approach to ensuring a communitys protection from hurricane destruction. The second amendment would make a technical change to the Acadiana Gulf of Mexico Access Channel (AGMAC) an existing project. in order to reduce costs and improve the beneficial use of dredge material. AGMAC was designed to allow for more efficient marine access from the Port of Iberia and other Acadiana Ports to the Gulf of Mexico by enlarging the existing channel to a project depth of twenty feet. Congress authorized the AGMAC project in the 2007 WRDA bill. My amendment would propose removing the entire phrase related to Incidental Storm Surge Protection from the 2007 WRDA description of the project. The original authorization amount of the project in 2007 was $131 million. the current cost of the project is $310 million. The main reason for the radical difference in cost estimates. is the Incidental Storm Surge Protection language that was inserted at the request of one specific group. My amendment would remove this specific provision. with the understanding from the Corps of Engineers in New Orleans. that this change would allow the Corps to maintain the authorized spending level for this project. and most importantly. permit this suspended project to move forward. Unfortunately due to an improper overreach back in 2007. a critical project has been on hold. This amendment would stimulate job creation. and the Acadiana economy by more than $50 million a year. has been delayed and now is the time to get it back on track. Millions of federal and state dollars have already been invested in performing feasibility studies to ensure that the AGMAC project was worthy of authorization. With the change proposed in my amendment. we can ensure that these dollars are not wasted. but instead that this critical project is completed. It is important to note that CBO found both of these amendments to be budget neutral. The amendment maintains the authorized spending level for both projects found in the WRDA 2007. There is NO additional cost to the American taxpayers. Instead these changes would a.) ensure that an entire town. not just half. is better prepared when the next hurricane hits the Gulf Coast. and b.) restore consistency when determining the use of dredge material from a navigation project. Mr. Chair. I understand why we have a rules process. I understand why we no longer have earmarks. However it is inefficient and irresponsible to stop an amendment that makes a NECESSARY. technical. budget neutral language change. I look forward to working with the Chairman to devise a simple and time efficient strategy forward to fix these problems. The Corps will continue to interpret legislative language the way it sees fit. If it is to the detriment of our constituents. is it expected that I will shrug that off and not fight that mistake? Thats not what the people of South Louisiana elected me to do here in Washington.
1130075798,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to take a moment just to respond to some of the comments that my friend on the other side made. First of all. there are three ongoing investigations that are incomplete. There is the congressional investigation being conducted by multiple committees. incomplete. there is the inspector general investigation. still incomplete and ongoing. and there is a third. a criminal investigation. I ask. first off. the question: Why start regulating now when we dont have all the information? Lets let all this go to conclusion and then institute the proper reforms. I want to point out that in its report on targeting. the inspector general recommended the Treasury and the IRS provide guidance on how to measure political activitynot what constitutes political activity. how to measure it. The proposed rule has been in development since 2011. Internal IRS emails between Treasury and IRS show that they were developing the rule off planoff plan. That means beyond the sunshine of disclosure and out in the openoff plan. What do they have to hide? Why are they doing this? And this is actually before all the allegations came out. Then. when asked at the markup of H.R. 3865this legislationwhether the proposed rule answers the inspector generals recommendation for the IRS and Treasury to provide guidance on measuring political activity. Tom Barthold. the chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. nonpartisan. said: The proposed rule does not address the measurement issue. All we are seeking to do is to delay the implementation of this rule until we complete the investigation and we have all the facts. and then we can talk about what necessary reforms should be implemented. But I think it is a bit premature to start putting forth regulations that will infringe on First Amendment rights. It is a very blunt instrument and a very dangerous path to embark upon at this point in time. With that. I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania . my friend. a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
1130075812,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. There is no denying that we may need reforms in this. There has been a lot of debate about this. The gentleman from California and I have had those kinds of conversations. But I would point out that the investigations are not complete. and they need to be complete. The ranking member mentioned earlier in his comments money and donors as reasons for this rule. but neither the word ""donor."" ""money."" or ""contributions"" appears in the regulation. It has been cited by the former Commissioner of the IRS that there was confusion. A confusion narrative emerged. but it was on the basis of no internal investigation at the IRS. There has been no interview of the employees. no facts established. We are still doing this investigation. from our standpoint. as is the inspector general. We know from our investigation so far. having interviews with the Cincinnati employees. that they were not confused by the rules. They were processing the applications until interference came down from Washington. from higher up in the Exempt Organizations Division of the IRS. Employees then flagged Tea Party applications and others because of what they said were ""media interest."" not confusion. Within 24 hours of the flagging for media interest. these Washington. D.C.. officials at the IRS requested Tea Party applications. Unlike the IRS. the Committee on Ways and Means has been investigating this matter. and we have not completed this investigation. But committee investigators have interviewed nearly three dozen IRS officials. from frontline screeners to the former commissioner. We have reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents. It is nearing completion. but this investigation is being held up. A central figure in this investigation is Lois Lerner. We have not gotten the information that we have requested from Lois Lerner. We have put the newly confirmed Commissioner on notice that if he wants to move forward with reforms and do all the things he wants to do during his tenure at IRS. we have got to get this investigation done. We have to get the facts on the table. and this IRS has to come clean before the American people. This agency occupies a central part of every single Americans life. It affects every one of us. This agency has the power to destroy each and every one of us. And that is why the trust and the integrity needs to be restored. All this rule does is shuts down speech. It does nothing that these gentlemen. our friends on the other side of the aisle. have mentioned in terms of reforms and cleaning up the election system and all that. No. it does none of that. It just simply stifles speech. I dont think that is appropriate. We owe it to the American people and we owe it to the integrity of this institution to complete this investigation. put the facts on the table. and follow these facts wherever they may lead. This is not political. This is simply looking at the facts. Rather than a recently drafted cure for confusion. this proposed rule. like I said. simply focuses to silence some of these small groups. silence conservatives. As early as 2011. long before the inspector general audit. IRS officials in Washington. D.C.. began talking about the proposed rule. We have email from Treasury to IRS. off planoff plan. Now we are trying to get more of those emails because we want to know what they mean by ""off plan."" What was really discussed and why was all this talked about before the allegations even came forward from these various groups? This is not right. We need to get to the bottom of it. And rather than curing confusion. the proposed rule would simply silence these social welfare organizations and have a disproportionate effect on some of these rightleaning conservative groups that were subject. in the first place. to the targeting. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130080975,I applaud Chairman BRADYs leadership on this issue. He has been instrumental in getting us to this point. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this bill after 3 long years of working on the policy to actually get to a bipartisan. bicameral agreement on policy and divided government. It has not been easy. but we have managed to get an agreement on a policy to repeal automatic annual cuts to physicians. A 24 percent cut in just a matter of weeks is facing doctors under this flawed formula. Now. Congress first promised to repeal this formula more than a decade ago. Democrats repeated the promise when we were debating ObamaCare. They failed to put it in there. They failed to address it in ObamaCare. The passage of this important bipartisan legislation would finally honor that promise. that of protecting seniors access to doctors. A doctorpatient relationship is built on trust and high quality. It ensures quality measures going forward. and it creates certainty for physicians and seniors. I want to point out something because our friends have not given the full story here. We have agreed on the policy. but we have a problem in coming up with the payfors. It is a tough conversation. but the talks have broken down in a divided government. Senate leadership has refused to negotiate in good faith and to discuss responsible ways to pay for the bills $138 billion price tag. We are going to pass this bill to get those discussions started. Republicans proposed savings from the delay of ObamaCares very unpopular individual mandate. Now. I dont think it is acceptable to do nothing. and I dont think it is acceptable for the Senate Majority Leader and others in the Senate to just put their heads in the sand on this. I hope that the Senate will pass a version of H.R. 4015. giving us time to get together to hash out the differences. We are so close. We are on the goal line in this work that has been undone for years. It is time to get it done. The Presidents own budget lists bipartisan Medicare reforms that the President put on the table that could easily raise the bulk of savings needed to repeal the SGR. and we could do this without shifting more costs to our Nations credit card and without resorting to budget gimmicks or by imposing massive new cuts on hospitals and other providers. We have a clear path. We can get this done in a bipartisan way. Mr. Speaker. as a heart surgeon who has cared for thousands of seniors under the Medicare program. I urge my House and Senate colleagues to pass this bill. Lets get down to the negotiations of how we are going to pay for it in good faith. and lets finalize an agreement on how to fix this longstanding problem. which has been a thorn not only in the sides of doctors but which has been a real problem for Medicare access. a real problem for seniors seeking access to a highquality doctorpatient relationship. Mr. Speaker. I have had enough. It is time to get this done. Pass this bill.
1130104651,Mr. Chair. first of all. I want to compliment Chairman SIMPSON on all the work he has done on this bill. but also the work he has done with me to plus up the harbor maintenance account and the funds available for dredging. It is critically important. I am very proud to stand with my colleague from Louisiana in support of this very important amendment. As my colleague expressed. the Presidents fiscal year 15 budget creates even more of a shortfall. We have got a significant backlog in harbor maintenance. This is going to hurt American competitiveness. In fact. roughly $3 billion worth of coastal navigation operations and maintenance work could be done if the funds that are collected for this were actually made available to be used for it. Louisiana is a leading State in trade. international trade. with three of our top ten ports that conduct trade in goods and energy. More U.S. merchandise travels by oceangoing vessels than by airplanes. trucks. freight trains. and pipelines combined. That is why these funds are critical for American competitiveness. and that is why they are really important in facilitating U.S. foreign trade. Our waterways are vital economic pathways for our Nations commerce and the ability to move American goods to these foreign markets. Hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on thisjobs in Louisiana and across the United States. This infrastructure is vital. Our amendment would take a modest step. It would redirect $1 million from the Department of Energys administrative offices to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operations and maintenance account. I believe this was a simple. strategic. and commonsense approach to help prioritize necessary maintenance and move us in the right direction. The Federal Government has the principal responsibility for maintenance of these harbors and shipping channels. Lets make sure that the Corps has the tools to do the job with the money that is collected for that job. The President failed to do that in his budget request. We can make that change now. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
1130116974,Mr. Speaker. I want to put this in strategic context. We are seeing a onceinacentury upheaval in the Middle East. and the most virulent manifestation of that is occurring in Syria today with a very complex civil war raging over several years. On one side you have the brutal Assad regime aligned with Iran and Hezbollah. another terrorist group. and on the other side a panoply of Sunni groups of which the worst. the most barbaric. is ISIL. It is in Americas national interest. our national security interest. to defeat and destroy ISIL. period. hands down. This is going to require American unity. American resolve. And I can tell you. never. never in recent times has American leadership been more in demand. This is the time for us to step up. It will take a lot of work. It is going to take merging the fighting capabilities of the Kurdish Peshmerga with the Iraqi forces. and. yes. it will take the U.S. training and vetting moderate Syrian forces to deal with this. This is a necessary first step. and that is why I support this amendment. It is necessary. It is not sufficient. Again. we need a broader strategy that is going to involve a coalition. This first step will show that American resolve to friends and foes alike as well as those who are on the sideline. We will demonstrate that and pull this coalition together. This will help the President have the necessary leverage to do this and put this coalition in place to defeat this threat of ISIL. but also to get to a broader political settlement in the region. because what is going on in Syria. even beyond ISIL. is a national security threat to the United States. That is why this country. all Americans. must speak with a unified voice. A strong vote on this amendment is essential as a first step to putting this in place. My colleagues. Mr. Speaker. I urge the PresidentI urge the Presidentto put all diplomatic efforts into putting together a strong coalition and to ask for very specific deliverables on each of these countries. whether it is Turkey or Qatar or the Saudis. These countries have to step up if we are going to have a successful strategy in the long run. The President needs leverage. This gives him the first step. I would hope that he will come to the Congress for a broader authorization for the use of military force because I do believe that will give him all the leverage he needs to complete this diplomatic task in putting a coalition together. along with the military strategy with these allies in the region. to defeat the immediate threat of ISIL and to eliminate this major problem we are seeing with a failed state in Syria that has allowed ISIL and some of these other extremist groups to arise. This is the time for unity. This is the time for American leadership. This is a time that we step up.

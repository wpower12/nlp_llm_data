1140004918,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 246. a bipartisan bill I introduced which will help victims of child sex trafficking by decriminalizing their behavior. First. I would like to thank Chairman KLINE from Minnesota and Ranking Member SCOTT from Virginia of the Education and the Workforce Committee for bringing this important bill to the floor for consideration. I want to also thank Representative WALBERG. who is managing the bill. for his kind words and his leadership. He is managing the bill today for the Republicans. I also thank Congresswoman KAREN BASS and Congresswoman ANN WAGNER for their leadership and support. Also. I would like to thank Senator PORTMAN. who I partnered with on this issue last Congress and who introduced the companion legislation in the Senate. I look forward to working with him again during the 114th Congress to advance this legislation. Mr. Speaker. last Congress. the House passed this exact bill unanimously by a vote of 4090. Today. I hope that my colleagues in the House will again approve this legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support so we can better assist victims of child sex trafficking and ensure they are viewed and treated as victims. not criminals. Earlier this month. I had the opportunity to participate in Ohios sixth annual Human Trafficking Awareness Day. which was held in my district at the Ohio statehouse. It was standing room only. The event was chaired by State Representative Teresa Fedor from Toledo. who has spent a lifetime on this issue. There. we heard story after story from victims. survivors. and advocates. just like the ones we heard on the House floor earlier today. Almost every time I am home in my district in Ohio. I hear from people who are concerned about the victims of child sex trafficking. Constituents implore me to have Congress do more to protect those among us who are the most vulnerable. those who are being forced into what many deem modernday slavery. This is for a good reason. Human trafficking is one of the fastestgrowing crimes in the world. In fact. according to the U.S. State Department. human trafficking is the worlds second largest criminal enterprise. after the illegal drug trade. Criminals involved in trafficking trade prey on those children already at risk in our society. the children who fall through the cracks in our society. In the United States. some 300.000 children are at risk each year of commercial sexual exploitation. Mr. Speaker. many of these children are runaways. homeless. and in and out of foster care. These children deserve better. The average age of a trafficked victim in the United States is 12 years of age. Mr. Speaker. this is shameful. At 12 years old. children should be playing sports. participating in their school science fair. learning new languages. or just being children. They should not be for sale night after night. In my home State of Ohio. each year. there is an estimated 1.100 Ohio children who become victims of human trafficking. and over 3.000 more are at risk. Ohio is the fifth leading State for human trafficking because of its proximity to a waterway that leads to an international border and a system of interstate highways that allow an individual to exit the State within 2 hours to almost anywhere. The 175 corridor runs through Toledo. Dayton. and Cincinnati. It is infamous for subjecting children to the horrors of sex trafficking. with reports of victims being repeatedly abused. We know that no single system can successfully combat trafficking. Preventing. identifying. and serving victims of trafficking requires a multicoordinated approach across all levels of government. We need to encourage all people: when they see something. say something. How can concerned citizens report activities of suspected child exploitation? Currently. the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children operates a CyberTipline. which receives leads and tips regarding suspected crimes of sexual exploitation committed against children. This CyberTipline is operated in partnership with the FBI. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. the United States Postal Inspection Service. United States Secret Service. United States Department of Justice. as well as other State and local enforcement agencies. These reports are constantly monitored to help ensure children in imminent danger get first priority. More than 2.8 million reports of suspected child exploitation have been made to the CyberTipline between 1998 and October of 2014. Under current law. child sex trafficking is not identified as one of the types of sexual exploitation that should be reported to the CyberTipline. even though the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children encounters child victims of sex trafficking and currently uses this term on its Web site in order to encourage the publics reporting of these types of crimes. Instead. the statute uses the term ""child prostitution""-yes. child prostitution. Mr. Speakerwhich we know does not fully and accurately capture these types of crimes against children. My bill would add the phrase ""child sex trafficking. including child prostitution."" to section b(1)(p) of the Missing Childrens Assistance Act. This legislation was crafted in order to improve and update the law in order to reflect the current state of Federal laws and to reinforce that children who are sextrafficked or sexually exploited are victims and not criminals. Mr. Speaker. children in sex trafficking situations are often misidentified as ""willing"" participants. We know there is a widespread lack of awareness and understanding of trafficking. Take. for instance. a story I recently heard about Holly. who is a survivor of human trafficking. When Holly was 14 years old. she ran away from home with a man she had met at a shopping mall. Holly and this man exchanged phone numbers. He continued to pursue Holly over the course of many months. Convincing her to run away with him was not an overnight accomplishment. He got to know her. analyzed her troubles. and asked about her dreams. He did this so that when Holly was on her summer break from the eighth grade. the pressures of her 14yearold world boiled to the surface. With all this confusion and pressure Holly was feeling. this predator was able to convince her to flee towards what she thought was opportunity. possibility. and freedom. In reality. Holly ran right into the clutches of a sexual trafficking ring. Within hours of running away with what turned out to be a manipulative and threatening pimp. she was coerced into prostitution. Fortunately for Holly. eventually an officer on the street thought that she seemed underage. so he approached her and arrested her. She was soon recognized to be a victim and began the long journey toward healing. Today. I am proud to say that Holly is an advocate for stronger antitrafficking laws and greater protection for survivors of all forms of human trafficking. This bill. H.R. 246. is intended to protect young children like Holly. to rescue and restore them. By adding the term ""child sex trafficking. including child prostitution."" to the Missing Childrens Assistance Act. we will be able to continue to fight the perception that sex trafficking is a voluntary. victimless crime. and this will exclude them from prostitution. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation."
1140042583,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in honor of the ThirtyOne Gives Foundation that is a philanthropic arm of ThirtyOne Gifts. Inc.. which is the 17th largest direct selling company in the world. I am so proud to have both based in my Ohio Third Congressional District. The ThirtyOne Gives Foundation is an organization dedicated to celebrating girls. women. and families by providing them with the support and selfesteem needed to lead to successful lives. Since its first meeting just in 2012. ThirtyOne Gives has donated over $80 million in product and cash to nonprofit organizations committed to their same mission. They have proudly partnered with many wellknown national organizations. such as the Ronald McDonald House. Girl Talk. Salvation Army. the American Heart Association. the Girl Scouts. and the YWCA of Central Ohio to advance this philanthropic mission. Cleverly built around their name. ThirtyOne Gifts. with over 16.000 consultants. volunteer on the 31st day of every month with 31 days. Mr. Speaker. I salute their volunteers for providing services such as preparing and serving homemade meals to families staying at the Central Ohio Ronald McDonald House. helping to give stability and strength in these families homes away from homes. They volunteer also to serve meals at the YWCA Family Center of Central Ohio. which provides emergency shelter and critical services to stabilize homeless families. As a longtime advocate against human trafficking and one of the sponsors of legislation included in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. S. 178. which was recently signed into law by President Obama. I salute ThirtyOne Gives for assisting over 15.000 women in transition from human trafficking. domestic violence. and homelessness. Mr. Speaker. during my recent district job tour. I had the opportunity to visit ThirtyOne Gifts and meet the founder. CEO. and president. Cindy Monroe. Today I salute this incredible civic leader. selfstarter. and entrepreneur and her team for making a difference in the lives of others and presenting a unique solution to the emotional and economic empowerment of women locally. nationally. and worldwide. I look forward to welcoming and joining this inspirational organization on Sunday. July 26. when some 16.500 sales leaders from ThirtyOne Gifts travel to my congressional district for their annual national sales conference being held right in Columbus. Ohio. As the members of ThirtyOne Gifts know. when we all work together and give a little piece of our heart. we can make a huge difference.
1140052669,"Thank you so much. Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker. tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life and legacy of three civil rights leaders. Congressman Lou Stokes. Amelia Boynton Robinson. and Julian Bond. who dedicated their lives to making our Nation a better place. Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. We have come to these chambers tonight. Mr. Speaker. to continue their work as members of the Congressional Black Caucus. We call on Congress to immediately pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The American people deserve to have real voting rights. Thank you. Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE. not only for your leadership tonight. but for being a leader. for walking in their shoes. and for hosting the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order honoring three giants. This year is the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. Leaders espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today. words because of the work of these three giants. works like: We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue. if our will is strong. if our hearts are right. and if courage remains our constant companion. then my fellow Americans. I am confident we shall overcome. Our objective must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules. and all Americans play against the same odds. Who amongst us would claim that that is true today? Just last week His Holiness. Pope Francis. delivered a historic. profound. provocative address to the Joint Session of Congress. This address reminded us that the nation is ""considered great"" when ""it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters."" At the White House. he quoted from Martin Luther King. to use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King: ""We can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note. and now is the time to honor it."" These three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. Tonights roll call: Congressman Lou Stokes. I am honored to be the third African American from Ohio to follow in his footsteps. following my mentor and dear friend. Stephanie Tubbs Jones. my colleague. mentor and friend. Congresswoman MARCIA FUDGE. who said at his footsteps: I dont salute or get excited about a one hit wonder because Lou Stokes was far from that. Lou Stokes loved people. He loved the law. He loved the legislative process. He loved his family. And he loved Cleveland. Ohio. You have heard so much about him. I wont repeat it. I will submit it for the RECORD. Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE. if that is okay. But I will forever be grateful for his encouragement. his friendship. his wisdom. and his leadership. I cant think of a time or a decision in my life that I didnt pick up the phone and call Lou Stokes. Love you. Lou Stokes. Let me just briefly say we also salute Amelia Boynton Robinson. and much has been said about her. I stand on her shoulders. And then Julian Bond. another great civil rights icon. whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the Georgia Legislature. the NAACP. and the Southern Poverty Law Center. which he cofounded. His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us. and his legacy will guide us and the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. He. like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight. helped change this country for the better. Thank you. Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE. Thank you to all my colleagues with the Congressional Black Caucus for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness.

1140071361,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank my colleagues Congresswoman ANN KUSTER and Congressman FRANK GUINTA for leading this important Special Order Hour on opioid and heroin abuse and dependence. Todays theme. ""Faces of Addiction."" gives us a unique opportunity to the powerful addicting qualities of heroin and opioids. which have serious implications for every family impacted by its abuse. Some of you may have seen the 60 Minutes segment. ""Heroin in the Heartland."" which filmed in parts of my district. Let me share the story of Robbie. whose struggle stands out to me. Robbie was prescribed opioidsOxycodone and Oxycontin. among othersfor a chronic pain condition. Although he said he never intended to abuse these medications. Robbie became an addict. taking painkillers for 25 years as his doctors kept prescribing higher and higher doses to manage his pain. Robbie eventually stopped caring about anything except opioids and finding his next dose of medication. His marriage fell apart. He became estranged from friends. He gained 90 pounds and developed diabetes. heart disease. and arthritis. He lost his will to live and contemplated suicide. Ultimately. it was a pharmacist who put a stop to Robbies opioid use by refusing to fill his prescription. This abrupt end to the drugs led Robbie to connect to a new doctor. an addiction specialist. Robbie is not alone in his struggle with opioid dependence and abuse. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. over 100 Americans died from drug overdose deaths each day in 2013. 46 Americans die each day from prescription opioid overdoses. which is two deaths per hour or 17.000 deaths annually. In Ohio. according to the Ohio Department of Health. from 2000 to 2012. Ohios death rate due to unintentional drug poisonings increased 366 percent. and this increase in deaths has been driven largely by prescription drug overdoses. On average. approximately five people die each day in Ohio due to drug overdose. As these statistics illustrate. much work remains to be done toward resolving the problems of opioid abuse nationally as well as in my home state. We need an honest effort to integrate prevention. treatment. and enforcement. Ohio is adding a weapon to its arsenal in fighting drug abuse by providing doctors and pharmacists with a oneclick link to the state opiate tracking system. Ohio will become the first state to integrate its database. the Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System (OARRS). with electronic medical records already maintained by doctors and pharmacists. This database linkup is one of the latest tools utilized by state officials to combat the epidemic of overdose deaths. The opioid epidemic has been particularly devastating to our fight to end infant mortality in central Ohio. When a pregnant mother abuses drugs. her unborn baby isnt just an innocent bystander. The drugs can affect that child to the degree that the baby will likely suffer withdraw after birth. As of 2013. about 12 in every 1.000 babies born in Franklin County faced that uphill battle. Those numbers grow year after year and experts say heroin is fueling the increase. That is why at the federal level. I cosponsored and voted in favor of the Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015. which was signed into law This new law will help prevent and treat babies exposed to opioids in utero. It will also support efforts to collect and disseminate strategies and best practices to prevent and treat maternal opioid use and abuse. Finding solutions to this epidemic will require all of us to work together at the Federal. State. and local levels. Drug abuse certainly isnt a partisan issue and many Members of Congress are actively engaged on the matter. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to address this epidemic."
1140074051,"Mr. Speaker. it is an honor and a privilege for me to rise this evening as cochair. along with my distinguished colleague who represents the Eighth District of New York. Congressman HAKEEM JEFFRIES. for this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. an hour of power. addressing the state of our Union. Dr. Kings dream. and todays African American message. Congressman JEFFRIES is a scholar. a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee. He continues to be a tireless advocate for social and economic justice. working hard to reform our criminal justice system. improve the economy for hardworking Americans. and to make college more affordable for all. Most importantly. he is someone that I am proud to follow and he is my colleague. Today we come to educate and to discuss some of the many contributions and accomplishments in American history that African Americans etched into the cornerstone of this America. Mr. Speaker. that they helped change. The Congressional Black Caucus is and continues to be a part of that change. As we reflect on Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. whose holiday we recently observed. thanks to our Congressional Black Caucus colleague. Congressman JOHN CONYERS. the dean. who worked tirelessly to have the day observed as a Federal holiday. we pause to reflect on our progress and our history not only to remember. but to acknowledge. our unfinished work. Congressional Black Caucus members and other colleagues with constituents across the country participated in holiday services. programs. marches. and many other events last week. This was not a day off. Mr. Speaker. but a day on in the spirit of Dr. Kings legacy. Mr. Speaker. I had the opportunity to join some 4.000 constituents in my district in Columbus for the Nations largest Martin Luther King breakfast celebration. As I sat there. I was reminded of his words that we live by and that we are guided by: ""Faith is taking the first step. even when you dont see the whole staircase."" Later I had the opportunity to join hundreds of folks to march in freezing weather. singing ""We Shall Overcome."" Today we also mark the beginning of the observation of Black History Month. to celebrate giants in civil rights. in the civil rights movement. as well as labor and education. transportation. the arts. and the service movement. As we reflect on Dr. Kings dream. just a few weeks ago President Barack Obama from this House floor. Mr. Speaker. delivered his final State of the Union Address. In his address. the President delivered a speech filled with hope and optimism. reminding us that we. the peopleemphasizing all peoplewant opportunity and security for our families. It was a message of a better future. fairness. and democracy for all Americans because we rise or fall together. Mr. Speaker. President Obama continues to remind us that ours is a nation bounded by a common creed and that our American values of equality. fairness. and justice should be available to all. not just a fortunate few. Far too long people and communities of color continue to be left behind when we discuss equality. fairness. and justice. In the 48 years since his death. while we have made some strides in confronting injustices and ending unequal treatment. there is still work to be done. Our Nation is still plagued by the vestiges of segregation and unequal laws and policies. evident today in Flint. Michigan. and its lack of clean drinking water. in it being harder. not easier. to exercise the constitutional right to vote through voter disenfranchisement. Black men being killed in Ferguson. Baltimore. Chicago. and my State of Ohio. inequities in health care. poverty. and in our failing schools. But. Mr. Speaker. the time is now for us to work together to protect the most at risk among us. to defend the foundation of our democracy. and to expand opportunity for all people. However. Republican leadership fails to act and refuses to bring up Voting Rights Advancement Act. a bipartisan piece of legislation. for an upordown vote. Tonight. Mr. Speaker. we will hear from our Congressional Black Caucus colleagues on the state of our Union and where we go from here. I welcome the dialogue and the debate. Mr. Speaker. it is now my honor and privilege to yield to Congresswoman BARBARA LEE from the 13th District of California. We know her as a fearless advocate. fighting to eliminate poverty. We know her as someone who has a history of representing not only the people of her district but the people of America. I have had the opportunity to witness this firsthand. as I serve on her committee when she fights to end the War on Poverty. It is my honor to ask Congresswoman BARBARA LEE to bring her message to us tonight."
1140074888,Mr. Speaker. today I rise in support of the American Heart Associations Go Red for Women campaign. The Go Red for Women campaign is a critical public awareness platform that the American Heart Association uses to help promote hearthealthy lifestyles. More than 627.000 womens lives have been saved from heart disease since the Go Red for Women campaign was created in 2004. We have made tremendous progress. Mr. Speaker. in the fight against cardiovascular disease. but we still have a long way to go. Heart disease is the number one killer of women and is more deadly than all forms of cancer combined. Heart disease causes one in three womens death each year. killing approximately 1 woman every minute. Ninety percent of women have one or more risk factors for developing heart disease. Since 1984. more women than men have died from heart disease. Heart disease is. unfortunately. a silent killer. According to the American Heart Association. nearly half of all women are not aware that heart disease is the leading cause of death for women. For African American women. the risk of heart disease is especially great. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for African American women. Of African American women 20 years of age and older. 46.9 percent have cardiovascular disease. yet only 43 percent of African American women know that heart disease is their greatest health risk. In fact. I did not realize that I was at risk for stroke. In 1999. I suffered a cerebral brain stem stroke. Because of my personal experience. I decided to be part of the solution. As this epidemic continues. I decided to not sit on the sidelines. In 2000. I was elected to serve on the National American Heart Association Board of Directors. I was the only nonphysician or nonmedical professional on the board at that time. As a board member. I served as a leader. guiding the American Heart Associations mission. cultural sensitivities. and national efforts. Here in Congress. my advocacy continues. As a member of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition. my colleagues and I work to raise awareness about the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular disease. Last Congress. I introduced two pieces of legislation that raise awareness for stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. One. the Return to Work Awareness Act. would assist survivors of stroke and other debilitating health occurrences in returning to work. Both pieces of legislation had the support of the American Heart Association and the National Stroke Association. I will reintroduce. Mr. Speaker. these important pieces of legislation this month during American Heart Month. I encourage all my colleagues. Democrats and Republicans. to join me as an original sponsor. Mr. Speaker. you will notice that many of our colleagues today will be wearing the red American Heart Association pin. By wearing this pin. we help raise the awareness of cardiovascular disease in women and provide an important reminder that it is never too early to take action to protect our health. This month. American Heart Month. let us recommit ourselves to improving hearthealthy lifestyles and to continue to fight against this deadly disease for ourselves and our families. Lastly. Mr. Speaker. I want to recognize all the survivors of heart disease and those who are battling heart disease. I salute their family members and friends who are their source of love and encouragement to them as they fight this disease. as well as my friend. American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown. and all the healthcare professionals and medical researchers who are working to find cures to improve treatments. Please join us. Sign onto my bill and support a healthy lifestyle.
1140079447,"Thank you so much. Congressman JEFFRIES. It is certainly an honor and a privilege for me to join you this evening as coanchor for this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. Congressman JEFFRIES scholarship and distinguished talents as a member of the Judiciary Committee have not gone unnoticed. I thank him for leading by example in challenging us to initiate and follow through in sending a message on Senate Republicans refusal to act on the Supreme Court vacancy. In part. tonights Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. Senate Republicans: Do Your Job. does just that. As you reflected in your opening statement. Article II. section 2. of the Constitution expressly designates that the President has a duty to name and the Senate has a responsibility to advise and consent a nominee to fill the seat. President Obama takes this very seriously. He has stated: ""Its a decision to which I devote considerable time. deep reflection. careful deliberation. and serious consultation with legal experts. members of both political parties. and people across the political spectrum."" But Republicans have made a decision to completely refuse consideration of anyone that President Obama nominates to the Supreme Court. In fact. they have stated that they wont hold a hearing or a vote before the full Senate. Senate Democrats never acted so recklessly when faced with this situation in 1988. when there was a vote to confirm Justice Kennedy. There was no talk of doing nothing until after that years election because it was unthinkable then to leave the Court shorthanded for that long. And it remains so now. The power of the Court. Mr. Speaker. is reflected in the work it does. Its decisions often shape the policy as profoundly as any law passed by Congress or any action taken by the President of these United States. When we look back to our history. especially as African Americans. the importance of the decisions handed down by the Supreme Court cannot be overstated. For example. most of us are familiar with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. which reversed Plessy v. Ferguson and its ""separate but equal"" ruling. Striking down segregation in our Nations public schools provided a major catalyst for the civil rights movement and made advances in desegregating housing. public accommodations. and institutions of higher education possible. After Brown. the Nation made some great strides towards opening the doors of education to all students. Unfortunately. the promise of the Brown decision remains unfulfilled in many ways. More than 2 million Black students attend schools where 90 percent of the student body is made up of minority students. On average. schools serving more minority populations have less experienced. lower paid teachers who are less likely to be certified. A report from the Center for American Progress found that a 10 percent point increase in students of color at a school is associated with a decrease in perpupil spending of $75. In many ways. more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education school systems in the United States are still separate and unequal. And we are just not witnessing educational disparities at the elementary and secondary education level. College enrollment is racially polarized. White students are overrepresented in selective colleges. which have more resources to educate and to support them. while African American students are overrepresented in less selective institutions. Mr. Speaker and Congressman JEFFRIES. you see where I am going with that. This is also why the late Justice Scalias comments during oral arguments of the pending United States Supreme Court case. Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. were so disturbing. He stated. in part: Maybe the University of Texas ought to have fewer African Americans. These comments are inaccurate and insulting to me and to African Americans. They undervalue the historic achievement that African Americans have made. Thousands of Black Americans have excelled to the top tier of their universities. Many of them you will hear from tonight because they are members of the Congressional Black Caucus. They are scholars. They are the conscience of the Congress. They represent the diversity of Americas best universities and of Americas Historically Black Colleges and Universities."
1140081554,Mr. Speaker. I thank Congressman JOHN LARSON. As I was listening to him reflect on the wonderful program that we are all going to be able to participate in at the Library of Congressas I listened to his words. 51 years ago the President of these United States could recognize what the Nation needed. It disappoints me. as I stand here on this House floor and I think about voting rights and I think about the condition of this Nation today and where we are when we talk about casting our votes and who we are going to cast our votes for. I say thank you for Congressman JOHN LEWIS and Congressman SAM JOHNSON. As I was listening to the gentleman. I thought about so many of the things that Congressman JOHN LEWIS has said to us not only on this floor. not only in private moments. but in our Congressional Black Caucus meetings. He represents that sense of history of why we come to continue our work. why we come to continue to stand up for the voting rights. Because he has said to us on numerous occasions. Mr. Speaker. that the vote is the most powerful and most nonviolent tool that we have in a democratic society. We must not allow the power of the vote to be neutralized. We must never go back. So I thank Congressman LARSON for taking us forward. for taking us on March 15 on a journey that we will remember for a lifetime. because. you see. we stand on the shoulders of those individuals who came before us. Now our voters stand on our shoulders. Our voters. Mr. Speaker. are wanting us. are thirsty for us. to stand up for them so that their vote counts. Mr. Speaker. I would like to ask my coanchor to share some thoughts with us on why our work continues. why it is so important in the African American community for us to stand up for not only African Americans. but for our citizens who are discriminated against. those who. when we talk about social and economic programs. we see the disparities in what happens to them in education. in health care. in housing. the juvenile justice system. the criminal justice system. I could not think of any better coanchor or colleague. someone who is such a great orator. someone who. when he stands up. we listen. Please. Congressman HAKEEM JEFFRIES. share with us some of your thoughts. I yield to the gentleman from New York.
1140099796,Mr. Speaker. I rise this evening. along with my colleague. Congressman HAKEEM JEFFRIES of the Eighth Congressional District of New York. for tonights Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. Bridging the Divide: A Call to Action By the Congressional Black Caucus to Eliminate Racial Health Disparities. Mr. Speaker. tonight. the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to discuss our overarching goal of promoting equality for African Americans across the healthcare spectrum. Mr. Speaker. it is well known that poverty. socioeconomic status. and health disparities are closely linked and latched together. For example. individuals with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care and face greater financial barriers to affordable health care. oftentimes contributing to health disparities. Last week. Mr. Speaker. the House Republicans released their Conferences poverty plan called A Better Way. Unfortunately. but not unexpectedly. this Republican antipoverty proposal isnt a better way. Mr. Speaker. It isnt even a new way. Quite frankly. Mr. Speaker. it is the wrong way. It uses the same trickledown. discredited policies that House Republicans have put forth in the past. The House Republicans poverty elimination proposal would repeal the Affordable Care Act and undermine affordable. quality health coverage that millions of Americans are now enjoying. It would also cut Medicaid. the Childrens Health Insurance Program that we refer to as CHIP. and it would end the Medicare guaranteeprograms with proven successes. Mr. Speaker. in reducing health disparities. So this is. in part. why we are here tonight. We know that health coverage is the first step in securing better healthcare outcomes. and Medicaid and CHIP play a vital role in opening the doorway to the needed health care. especially for our children. As we address the most pressing challenges in achieving health equity and equality for African Americans. I want hardworking American families to know that they have voices in Congress that aim to protect their safety. invest in their future. and provide affordable health care for all. With the Affordable Care Act. which every member of the Congressional Black Caucus supported when it passed. we have improved access. We have improved affordability and quality of health care. So tonight. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank President Obama for moving the needle forward in helping American families and African American families across this great country and Nation to have the financial and health security that comes with health care. Mr. Speaker. we cannot repeal the ACA. We must continue to improve and strengthen it. and we will still have more work to do. The Congressional Black Caucus. from its very inception. has long been the voice for bridging the divide on racial healthcare disparities. No. Mr. Speaker. we have been the voice for standing up for American people. and especially individuals who are African American. against all disparities. We will not only come to this floor tonight. We will continue our fight and we will continue to come to this floor. Tonight. you are going to hear a lot of our members weave together our poverty plan. You are going to have members talk about gun violence. You are going to have members talk about all lives matter. If we dont end the gun violence. then we are not going to have a healthy nation. Tonight. I want to applaud my good friend and colleague. Congresswoman ROBIN KELLY of the Second District of Illinois. chair of our Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. I want to commend her for her report. the 2015 Kelly Report on Health Disparities in America. the official congressional analysis of the state of African Americans health in the United States. and her work on the 40 Under 40 Leaders in Health Awards. leaders under 40 who are physicians and medical professionals. And lastly. let me just thank her for her courage and her leadership for recognizing that all lives matter. We cannot come to this House floor and talk about poverty programs and health care and education and about finance if we do not bridge the gap with gun violence. I salute her for no longer standing up until we make a difference. So tonight. we are coming. Mr. Speaker. with a strong call to action for us to keep this wonderful America healthy. You will hear from Congresswoman KELLY momentarily. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina . chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. He is a chairman who has been a longtime advocate and voice for not only the Congressional Black Caucus. but for his constituents in his congressional district in North Carolina. Tonight. he speaks for us. Tonight. he speaks for the call of action of us to bridge the gap.

1140032500,"Mr. President. this Saturday will be the 71st anniversary of one of the greatest days in historyDday. June 6. 1944. the day that led to Allied victory in Europe in World War II. the preservation of Western democracy. no less. and freedom for generations to come. Few days in history belong to individuals. but this day. Dday. belongs to Dwight David Eisenhower. Ike came to this day. which forever established his place in history as a soldier. as a Kansan. and most of all as an American. I come to the floor today as a Senator. as a marine. and as Ikes fellow Kansan. Most of all. I come to share Ike with my fellow Americans and my colleagues in the Senate. There are days in history that change nations and the course of history itself. Dday. June 6. 1944. was one of those days. The events growing out of that day changed the course of millions of lives. preserved Western civilization. and led to victory over a ruthless tyranny totally dedicated to destroying democracy. The sacrifices and human losses were immense. Several weeks ago. on May 8. the whole of Europefrom Amsterdam to Moscowwas not only celebrating European victory in World War II but also remembering the special sacrifices of the brave young Americans who made victory possible when it seemed impossible. especially in June of 1944. when the whole of Europe and much of Russia was under the Nazi boot. These cataclysmic events were set in motion on Dday by the heroic decisionmaking of one man. a Kansan from modest origins and humble rootsDwight David Eisenhowerwho. at the direction of the President of the United States. carried individually the sole responsibility of supreme command of all Allied forces in Europe in World War II. The decision to launch the invasion was his alone. and the risk of failure was enormous. with huge human losses assured for America and all of its allies. Ikes decision. however. proved correct and was followed by the greatest demonstration of military coalition leadership ever seen in historybefore or since Dday. This brilliant leadership by General Eisenhower led to victory in Europe in 1945. followed by the defeat of Japan. Ike never let his gigantic role in history push his ego ahead of modesty. common sense. and humility. As he famously said in 1945. ""Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives acclaim earned in blood of his followers and sacrifices of his friends."" Ikes transcending humanity won not only his fellow citizens respect but also their affection. Indeed. he won the respect and affection of much of the world. and he is celebrated internationally to this very day. Currently. I am privileged to serve as the chairman of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission. Two giants of the United States Senate brought me to this role: Congressional Medal of Honor winner Danny Inouye and U.S. Army Flying Tiger pilot Ted Stevens. both combatdecorated World War II veterans who decided Ike. both as general and as President. should be nationally memorialized. They decided and convinced the Congress that the general and President Eisenhower should be nationally celebrated. And the day it all began was Dday. Senator Inouye from Hawaii and Senator Stevens from Alaska knew that Ike represented more than Kansas. more than America. but the entire world as well and that he spoke to the world. His identity was simple. basic. and convincing. In paying homage in 1945 to the British fathers and mothers of the soldiers. sailors. and airmen who had died under his command. he also said. ""I am not a native of this land. I come from the very heart of America."" It is a paradox of unfortunate irony that those members of the ""greatest generation"" who come on Honor Flights from all across our great Nation to the World War II Memorial cannot visit. reflect. and pay homage to a memorial to the general who led them to victory. Today. in the midst of a much different war and during a time when our Nation is searching for resolve. commitment. and leadership. I suggest and recommend that all of my colleagues reflect upon the unique leadership of Americas greatest general when the future of Western democracy was in grave peril. Time is of the essence. and now is the time to complete a lasting memorial and tribute to Americas greatest wartime general and President of the United States whose legacy was 8 years of peace and prosperity. The veterans of World War II and their families know this. and their counterparts all over the world know this as well. With the completion of the Eisenhower memorial. their children and grandchildren and generations to come will understand the tremendous commitment undertaken in defense of freedom. then and now. Now is the time. I yield the floor."
1140051407,Mr. President. I first want to commend the Senator from Iowa. Senator GRASSLEY has done a great job of a detailed report on why this bill is so extremely important. and I thank him for his comments. My remarks will be somewhat abbreviated. Today I rise to speak about this very important legislation. absolutely crucial legislation the Senate is considering tomorrow. Like so many Americans. I agree that we have a responsibility to protect those who cannot defend themselves. That is why I am a cosponsor of the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Actthis critical legislation which simply prohibits abortions after an unborn child reaches 20 weeks of development. Scientific evidenceSenator GRASSLEY reported about thathas shown that after 20 weeks. a childs brain has developed to a point where they can experience pain. With modern medical advances. even children born at this early stage have a chance to survive. It is appalling that the United States is one of only seven countries where elected abortions after 20 weeks are legal. How can our country take pride in protecting human rights when we continue to allow this practice to happen within our own borders? A poll conducted by the Quinnipiac University found that a majority of Americans now support the banning of this abhorrent practice. Representing the values shared by a majority of Americans should be a bipartisan effort. We need to work together to protect innocent life. So many Americans are troubled by the recent videos of Planned Parenthood employees selling fetal tissue for a profit. Those videos have helped the American people understand exactly what life at conception means. This legislation is a line of defense for protecting unborn children from Planned Parenthoods unconscionable practices. I commend the States that have stopped this practice in the absence of a Federal law. Thirteen States maintain prohibitions of abortion at 20 weeks. This includes my home State of Kansas. It is now time for the Senate to act and ensure that this practice is banned all across the Nation. I encourage my colleagues to unite on this issue and support this critical legislation.
1140061579,I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. President. I have been sitting here thinking about Missouri and Kansas and our past historiessome differences in politics. some differences in sports. big time. down through the years. What a great thing to happen when. yes. there is the Kansas City Royals in Missouri. I might be a little local here and say primarily filled by Kansas fans. but I will not do that. but it is a great day for both of our States and for people who live in our area. We are all proud of our Kansas City Royals. It was a hardfought World Series victory. but it was celebrated in Kansas from Goodland to Liberal. from Parsons to Troy. way up there on Highway 36 and everywhere in between. Yesterday we saw something amazing happen: Kansas fans and Missouri fans marching in a sea of blue in downtown Kansas City. There were more than onehalf million peopleno shoving. no pushing. no fires. no problems. There were young and old people from all walks of life. all races. all nationalities. and all Royals fans. The schools were closed. Workers took a break. The streets filled. The windows opened. and it was a gorgeous Royals blue day. Some are celebrating this kind of victory for the first time. Others are remembering 1985. George Brett and that team. and seeing that same excitement again. this time in their childrens eyes. You see. some of us really counted us outor some counted us out. We are. in fact. a small market team. a team with young but very talented guys. They said we havent had what it takes to be World Series champions. We didnt have the big name home run hitters or the big name flamethrower pitchers or a big park made smaller for home run hitters. What we did have was a team. players who kept the line moving. The stats made the difference. as indicated from my colleague and friend from Missouri. who went through a number of stats that are rather remarkable. In this postseason. the Royals strikeout rate was only 16 percent. just 81 strikeouts in 505 plate appearances. The Royals regular season average was better. just 15 percent. For baseball. that is really amazing and it was the best in baseball. The league average in the regular season was more than 20 percent20 percent strikeouts. one out of five. That is why people keep yawing. They dont yawn when they watch the Royals. These Royals had a manager who let them play as they were: young. fast. and aggressive. That is rather remarkable. Ned Yost let them choose whether or not to stealthat is amazing. He let them swing at the first pitch. Alcides Escobar hit that insidethepark home run in the first pitch in the bottom of the first inning of the first game of the World Series at Kauffman. That is a ball park for playing baseball: hitting. running. fielding. and a few home runs. He let them play the game. They were relentless. They kept the lines moving. went against unconventional baseball wisdomand oh was it fun to watch. We won. Kansas City won. and baseball won. Our celebration today is about the Royals. the joy of the game of baseball. but it is also about our identity as a city and a region. We were told that a small market team from flyover country would not be able to beat the New York Mets. We won because we kept the line movingjust like the Royals fans do in Kansas and Missouri every daythrough a couple of decades of postseason drought. proving our team. our fans. our kind of game is the best in baseball. I know I speak for the fans all over our State and the hundreds of thousands of fans that gathered to enjoy and celebrate a victory for our team and. yes. for our region. tooand I think for our country. Everybody adopted the Royals. Thank you. Royals. Thank you for showing the world what fun baseball can be if you play the game. if you keep the lines moving. The Kansas City Royals are the 2015 World Series champions. How about them apples? I thank my colleague.
1140062003,"Mr. President. I rise today regarding President Obamas most recent. egregious attempt to close the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base detention facilities and relocate enemy combatants. i.e.. terrorists. to the United States. Who are we talking about here when we say enemy combatants with regard to our national security and the problems that this may pose? We still have some highlevel terrorists at Gitmo. It reminds me of the five terrorists that we let out sometime ago in exchange for a Sgt. Bergdahl. These are highlevel terrorists. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed we know is the mastermind of 9/11. Abd alRahim alNashiri. the USS Cole bomber. I was a member of the Intelligence Committee when that happened. and I was concerned that we didnt connect the dots with regards to our national security and our national safety. That certainly was the case. We have Hambali. who is the Bali bomber. We have four coconspirators with Khalid with regards to 9/11Ramzi bin alShibh. Mustafa Ahmed al Hawsawi. Abd al Aziz Ali. and Walid bin Attash. These are folks that are still determined to do great harm to the United States. I dont think they changed their minds. The Presidents determined effort to close Gitmo began his first days in office when he signed Executive Order 13492. requiring the close of Gitmo within 1 year. Fortunately. for the security of the United States. the Congress stood up to this Executive order and stopped it. and the Presidents attempt to close Gitmo was also met by strong objections from all across the country. even in his home State of Illinois. Illinois turned its back on a plan to transfer detainees to a staterun prison. the Thompson Correctional Facility. More importantly. the Congress laid down its first marker on prohibiting the President from transferring or releasing detainees to the United States through the Supplemental Appropriations Act passed in June of 2009. Every year since then7 yearsthe Congress has maintained this prohibition. This years National Defense Authorization Act continues to enforce the will of the American people and the Congress. Yet just yesterday the Presidents Press Secretary announced blithely that the President is not bound by Congressand I would include the American peopleand the President will do what he wants to do by another Executive order if he determines that is the best approach. National Security Advisor Susan Rice has just been quoted as saying: ""I cant say with certainty that were 100 percent going to get there. but I can tell you were going to die trying."" That is a pretty bold statement. What the President wants to do doesnt equate with national security. I think he wants to fulfill his campaign promise and preserve his alleged legacy and simply close Gitmo. not taking a hard look at what may take place. Now I have gone headtohead with this administration on many issues but none are as close to my strong belief and commitment to protect the United States. the people of Kansas. and all Americans. It does not make sense to locate terrorists at Fort Leavenworth. KS. which is the intellectual center of the Army. and to pose a threat to that community. I have often said that the first obligation of any Member of Congress is to protect our national security. Allowing Gitmo terrorists to set foot in the United States is in direct violation. in my view. of that commitment. and we should not stand for this President or any future President to threaten our security by Executive order. It is regrettable that I have to be here making this speech at all in response to the administration and the news that suddenly appears in the Nations press that there were people visiting Colorado. Fort Leavenworth. and Charleston. SC. In September. in response to the administrations visit to Kansas. I placed a hold on the administrations nominee to serve as Secretary of the Army. I dont like doing this. I have no personal bias whatsoever with regard to this person politically or the ability to do the job. I did so with purpose and respect. I articulated this to the Army. I articulated this to my good friend and colleague John McHugh. who was the Secretary of Army. to the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense. During my conversations I was reminded that the administration could not implement any parts of this study without explicit authorization from Congress. So if and when a study is producedif there is a plan. and we dont know if there is a planthe administration would come before Congress to ask for that authority and the money. Guess what. no money can be spent on that. So it seems to me that is already a violation. The administrations threat to act by Executive order yesterday speaks to the exact opposite of the understanding that I have. Congress has listened to the American people and done what is necessary to uphold national security and prohibit this administration from behaving in an unleashed fashion. I know the President is resolute. He reminded us of that fact by signing 223 Executive orders during his Presidency. It is not so much the number of Executive orders but Executive orders that are in direct violation or in opposition to the intent of the Congress. I just dont think this should be determined by ignoring the Congress and simply issuing an Executive order. That is not the way to go. It just raises all this dust in opposition. and people like me come to the floor extremely worried about what this could bring. I remember before 9/11. when I made the statement that the oceans no longer protected us. Our threat level remains high today. The threat of ISIS grows. stability in Syria continues to erode. Russia is advancing in the Middle East. and Iran continues to churn its nuclear reactors. We cannot. it seems to me. we must not act politically. We must not take action simply because of ""legacy"" and a political campaign promise. Instead. we must act conscientiously. The only conscientious way forward on this issue is to maintain detention at Guantanamo Bay. To do otherwise would be a violation of U.S. law. not to mention a bullseye on Fort Leavenworth. where we have the intellectual center of the Army and the Army Command and General Staff College. That is not wise. That does not make any sense. Let me say that there is another issue the President has brought up. and that is the issue of recruitment. We hear this from people who honestly believe that if we close Gitmo. somehow it will take away the incentive for various terrorist groups to recruit other terrorists from this country and all across Europe. all around the world. saying: Oh my goodness. we have terrorists at Gitmo. and when will the United States close that so that we can close our recruiting? If we have terrorists located in the United States. it seems to me that the recruiting would simply be this: All right. Gitmo is closed. but we have our brothers at Fort Leavenworth. we have our brothers in Charleston. and we have our brothers in Colorado. What do you think would happen with regard to what they would do in response to that. not only to recruit people but to act? This goes back to the welfare of all Americans. not to mention those in Colorado. Kansas. and South Carolina. This is a bad ideaa very bad idea. I hope those of us in the Congress will maintain our vigilance and make sure that no money will ever be authorized or appropriated with regard to taking terrorists from Gitmo and locating them in the United States. We must not do it. It is the wrong decision. It is a bad decision. I dont know why the President is so stubborn about it. I yield the floor."
1140068616,"Mr. President. I rise to alert the Senate and all of my colleagues to yet anotheryes. yet anotheregregious action by the Internal Revenue Service. one that will affect every charity. every church. every nonprofit. and the communities they work so hard to serve. I emphasize ""another"" because it seems that the IRS continues a march toward regulations and practices that target and burden hardworking Americans. Let me just recap. First. we learned that the IRS had released confidential tax return information on companies the IRS believed opposed the administration. Then we uncovered that the IRS had illegally targeted groups whose views differed from the White House. followed by an extensive effort to hide information on these actionsi.e.. Lois Lerner. her socalled ""lost emails."" which werent ever really lost. It was true injustice to lawabiding organizations and American citizens. which is why I should not have been surprisedbut I wasto learn of the IRSs latest scheme. Hot off the press is a new IRS proposed regulation that needlessly targets charitable contributions. Right now. when you make a contribution of $250 or more. charities will send you a ""written acknowledgement"" confirming the details of the donation. including the amount of the donation. The taxpayer uses this acknowledgement to document his or her tax deductions should there be any question. Most charities take the time to send out a written confirmation of the donation as part of their thankyou to the donor. It is simple. it is inexpensive. and it builds good will. In short. it works for the taxpayer and also for the charity. That is ita straightforward. commonsense method to confirm a donation was made. and no one. not even the IRS. argues that it is not working well. But now the IRS has proposed a new method to substantiate donationsa method that could do great harm to the charitable sector and give the IRS more tools to go after taxpayers they may not like. as we know they have done before. The IRS wants to set up a new. more formal system where the charity would have to gather information about its donors. keep that information. andhere is the rubreport the information to the IRS. What type of information are we talking about? The return would include the charitys name and address. the donors name and address andhere is the scary piecethe donors Social Security number. Again. all of this new information would have to be sent to the donor and the IRS and kept on file by the charity at considerable cost. Even more disturbing. the IRS would store. maintain. and use this information in case the donor is audited. Although this is described as an option. given the IRSs recent track record. do we really trust the agency to store this information and not use it for other purposes? I. for one. do not. I dont think we can trust them with a new source of data on donors. We must do all we can to prevent the IRS from gaining access to this sensitive data. I am also alarmed at the thought of whether the IRS can properly safeguard this information because the agency has demonstrated zero capacity to keep similar data out of the hands of people who commit fraud. and thieves. Charities and churches that routinely receive thousands of dollars from their supporters now become greater targets for people to commit fraud. Earlier this year. the IRS admitted that it had been hacked and private taxpayer information had been compromised. If they can do it to the IRS. you had better believe they can do it to your local nonprofit. And while the IRS today says this rule as proposed would simply be voluntary. suffer no illusion: The IRS will eventually move to make this a mandatory requirement. Charitable organizations are also speaking out against the IRS proposal. They understand the chillingchillingeffect this would have on their donors. but. more importantly. on the communities they serve. Tim Delaney. president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits. recently wrote: The IRS proposal would open the door for scam artists. . . . Nonprofits have neither the financial resources nor sufficient staffing to combat hackers who will see an easy source for Social Security information. This also creates a liability nightmare for innocent nonprofits. . . . To be asked to share their address. their credit card number and their Social Security number all in the same place would be enough to scare even the most committed donor to decline to give. Tim Delaney has aptly summarized this pending and serious problem. He poses very legitimate concerns. especially regarding how scam artists might operate. explaining: Imposters phone scripts will go something like this: ""Hi ... Im working for several nonprofits here in Kansas to make sure that generous donors like you get full credit for your wonderful contributions .... The nonprofits asked me to thank you for your generosity and confirm your name and address. ... Also. the IRS has a new regulation that nonprofits need your Social Security number so we can send you a form confirming your contribution in case you get audited. Whats your Social Security number so we can send you the form?"" Sadly. many people who want to be sure to support their charity will give the scam artists exactly what they want. To protect the mission of our nonprofit community and the taxpayers who share their hardearned dollars with those in need. I have introduced legislation to block this regulation and to maintain current law. The Protecting Charitable Contributions Act would maintain current IRS rules governing the substantiation of charitable contributions. and prohibit the IRS from issuing. revising. or completing any new regulation that would alter the existing rules. This just makes sense. And I would think the IRS would agree when in their own description of the proposal they state that the present system works effectively. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to join me in stopping this dangerous and unneeded proposal from moving forward. I urge all those who play a role in supporting nonprofits to go to the IRS Web site before December 16 to provide written comments to the IRS about this proposal. Yep. the IRS would like to have your comments. Let me repeat that. I would urge all those who play a role in supporting nonprofits to go to the IRS Web site before December 16 to provide written comments to the IRS about this proposal. The message should be simple: No. This is one Christmas greeting you had better send. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140073551,Thank you to my colleagues. Senator ENZI and Senator MURKOWSKI. for their work on these important issues related to wildfire and forest management. I would like to echo their concerns and share with the rest of my colleagues that I agree with them entirely that this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Coming off the end of a catastrophic wildfire season with a record amount of acres burned. it is essential that the Senate turn its attention to finding a wildfire solution in 2016and through regular order. As chairman of the Agriculture Committee. it is my first and foremost priority that the committee serve as the platform for Americas farmers. ranchers. small businesses. rural communitiesand forest land owners and forestry stakeholders. a constituency sometimes forgotten. As chairman of the Agriculture Committee. we intend to serve and represent all of agriculture. of which forestry plays an important role. Last November. the Agriculture Committee held a hearing on the effects of wildfire and heard testimony from stakeholders on the budgetary impacts and threats to natural resources on Federal. State. and private forest lands. The message from that hearing was unanimous and clear: it is time for Congress to act and advocate for solutions that not only address funding fixes. but more importantly advocate for solutions that improve the management of our national forests. H.R. 2647. the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015. which passed the House last summer. has been referred to the Senate Agriculture Committee. This legislation. while not perfect. includes provisions that attempt to address both the funding mechanism and incorporate meaningful forest management tools which are the paramount issues in the overall wildfire debate. I recognize the challenges that remain ahead with crafting such a legislative proposal that satisfies all interested parties involved in this larger debate. With that being said. I stand ready to work with my colleagues to find areas where common ground and consensus can be achieved to address the overall wildfire issues facing us today. I look forward to working together with Senator MURKOWSKI. Senator ENZI. and others to provide the necessary tools to expedite the much needed work on not just Western forests. but also nationwide. encompassing Federal. State. and private forest lands.
1140082029,Mr. President. today is National Agriculture Day. and I wish to thank the farmers and ranchers of America. The Senate is considering legislation on an issue that is critically important to our Nations food supply. It affects everyone from our producers in the fields to our consumers in the aisles of grocery stores. Without Senate action. this country will be hit with a wrecking ballan apt descriptionthat will disrupt the entire food chain. We need to act now to pass my amendment to S. 764. This is a compromised approach that provides a permanent solution to the patchwork of biotechnology labeling laws that will soon be wreaking havoc on the flow of interstate commerce. agriculture. and food products in our Nations marketplace. and that is exactly what this is about. Let me repeat that. This is about the marketplace. It is not about safety. It is not about health or nutrition. It is about marketing. Science has proven again and again and again that the use of agriculture biotechnology is 100 percent safe. In fact. last year the Agriculture Committee heard from three Federal agencies tasked with regulating agriculture biotechnology: the Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. the Environmental Protection Agencyyes. the EPAand the Food and Drug Administration. the FDA. Their work is based on sound science and is the gold standard for policymaking. including this policy we are debating todayone of the most important food and agriculture decisions in recent decades. At our hearing. the Federal Government expert witnesses highlighted the steps their agencies have already taken to ensure that agriculture biotechnology is safesafe to other plants. safe to the environment. and safe to our food supply. It was clear our regulatory system ensures biotechnology crops are among the most tested in the history of agriculture in any country. At the conclusion of the hearing. virtually all Senate Agriculture Committee members were in agreement. What happened? When did sound science go out the window? Since that hearing. the U.S. Government reinforced their decisions on the safety of these products. In November. the FDA took several steps based on sound science regarding food produced from biotech plants. including issuing final guidance for manufacturers that wish to voluntarily label their products as containing ingredients from biotech or exclusively nonbiotech plants. More important. the Food and Drug Administration denied a petition that would have required the mandatory labeling of biotech foods. The FDA stated that the petitioner failed to provide the evidence needed for the agency to put such a requirement in place because there is no health safety or nutritional difference between biotech crops and their nonbiotech varieties. regardless of some of the rhetoric we have heard on the floor of the Senate. Thus. it is clear that what we are facing today is not a safety or health issue. despite claims by my colleagues on the Senate floor. it is a market issue. This is about a conversation about a few States dictating to every other State the way food moves from farmers to consumers in the value chain. We have a responsibility to ensure that the national market can work for everyone. including farmers. manufacturers. retailers. and. yes. consumers. This patchwork approach of mandates adds costs to national food prices. In fact. requiring changes in the production or labeling of most of the Nations food supply for a single State would impact citizens in our home States. A recent study estimates that the cost to consumers could total as much asget this-$82 billion annually. which comes to approximately $1.050 per hardworking American family. This Vermont law. which is supposed to go into effect in July. will cost each hardworking family $1.050. Let me repeat that. If we fail to act. the cost to consumers could total as much as $82 billion annually and will cost each hardworking American family just over $1.000. Now is not the time for Congress to make food more expensive for anybodynot the consumer or the farmer. Todays farmers are being asked to produce more safe and affordable food to meet the growing demands at home and around a troubled and very hungry world. At the same time. they are facing increased challenges to production. including limited land and water resources. uncertain weather patterns. and pest and disease issues. Agriculture biotechnology has become a valuable tool in ensuring the success of the American farmer and meeting the challenge of increasing their yields in a more efficient. safe. and responsible manner. Any threat to the technology hurts the entire value chainfrom the farmer to the consumer and all those who are involved. I also hearand I do understand the concern from some of my colleagues about consumers and available information about our food. Some consumers want to know more about ingredients. This is a good thing. Consumers should take an interest in their food. where it comes from. and the farmers and ranchers who also produce their food. I can assure you the most effective tool consumers have to influence our food system or to know more about food is by voting with their pocketbooks in the grocery stores and supermarkets. This legislation puts forward policies that will help all consumers not only find information but also demand consistent information from food manufacturers. However. it is important. as with any Federal legislation on this topic. for Congress to consider scientific fact and unintended consequences. The committeepassed bill created a voluntary national standard for biotechnology labeling claims of food. I have heard concerns that a voluntaryonly standard would not provide consumers with enough information. even though there is no health. safety. or nutritional concern with this biotechnology. So we worked out a compromise to address these concerns by providing an incentive for the marketplace to provide more information. This legislation will allow the markets to work. However. if they do not live up to their commitments and information is not made available to consumers. then this legislation holds the market accountable. Under this proposal. a mandatory labeling program would go into effect only if a voluntary program does not provide significant information after several years. The marketplace would then have adequate time to adjust and utilize a variety of optionsa menu of optionsto disclose information about ingredients. along with a wealth of other information about the food on the shelves. Simply put. the legislation before us provides an immediate comprehensive solution to the unworkable StatebyState patchwork of labeling laws. Preemption doesnt extend to State consumer protection laws or anything beyond the wrecking ball that we see related to biotechnology labeling mandates. and we do ensure that the solution to the State patchwork. the one thing we all agree upon. is effective. It sets national uniformity that allows for the free flow of interstate commerce. a power granted to Congress in the U.S. Constitution. This labeling uniformity is based on science and allows the value chain from farmer to processor. to shipper. to retailer. to consumer to continue as the free market intended. This ensures uniformity in claims made by manufacturers and will enhance clarity for our consumers. Increasingly. many Americans have taken an interest in where their food comes from and how it is made. Lets keep in mind this is a good thing. We want consumers informed about food and farming practices. but at the same time we must also not demonize food with unnecessary labels. This debate is about more than catchy slogans and madeup names for bills. It is about the role of the Federal Government to ensure the free flow of commerce. to make decisions based upon sound science. all the while providing opportunity for the market to meet the demands of consumers. This is not the first time this body has addressed this issue. In 2012 and 2013. Members of the Senate soundly rejected the idea of mandatory labeling for biotechnology. That is right. Both times more than 70 Members voted to reject mandatory labeling. This body then stood up for sound science and common sense. and I trust my colleagues will continue to stand up and defend sound science again. Time is of the essence for not only agriculture in the food value chain but also consumers who work together. face the wrecking ball of this patchwork of StatebyState mandates. This legislation has the support of more than 650 organizations. We never had 650 organizations contact the Agriculture Committee about any other bill. any other piece of legislationmore than 650. My staff now tells me that number is over 700. large and small. representing the entire food chain. and that number continues to grow every day. That is quite a coalition. They are here in Washington trying to say: Look. this is not going to work with regard to StatebyState regulation. As I have said. never before in the Agriculture Committee have we seen such a coalition of constituents all united behind such effort. Their message is clear: It is time for us to act. It is time for us to provide certainty in the marketplace. I appreciate the bipartisan support of those on the committee who joined me to vote out our committee bill. The vote was 14 to 6. We made significant changes to address the concerns of others. Now we must carry this across the finish line. I urge my colleagues to support this compromising approach and protect the safest. most abundant. and affordable food supply in the world. I yield the floor. Upon close inspection. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1140082337,Quoting from the article. Ms. Borlaug said: I am glad to see my grandfathers work praised. . . . Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts . . . has put forward a bipartisan proposal that would establish national standards for food made with geneticallyengineered ingredients. The Biotech Labeling Solutions Act would prevent a costly statebystate patchwork of labeling mandates. It would also help ensure that providing greater information could go handinhand with providing greater education at a national level about the safety and importance of GMO crops. . . . Sixteen years ago. my grandfather wrote that the world would soon have the agriculture technologies available to feed the 8.3 billion people anticipated in the next quarter of a century. The more pertinent question is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use these technologies. I rise again to discuss my amendment numbered 3450 on biotechnology labeling solutions. There has been a lot of discussion about this amendment and this topic in general. That is a good thing. We should be talking about our food. we should be talking about our farmers and producers. and we should be talking about our consumers as well. It is importantextremely importantto have an honest discussion and an open exchange with dialogue. After all. that is what we do in the Senate or at least that is what we are supposed to do. We are here to discuss difficult issues. craft compromised solutions. and finally vote in the best interest of our constituents. That is what we are doing here today: exercising our responsibility to cast a vote for what is in the best interest of those who sent us here. Lets start with discussing difficult issues. The basic issue at hand is agriculture biotechnology labeling. If you have heard any of my previous remarks. you have heard me say time and time and time again that biotechnology products are safe. but you dont have to take my word for it. The Agriculture Committee held a hearing late last year where all three agencies in charge of reviewing biotechnology testified before our members. Over and over again the EPA. the FDA. and the USDA told us that these products are safesafe for the environment. safe for other plants. and safe for our food supply. This is the gold standard on what is safe with regard to agriculture biotechnology. Not only are these products safe. but they also provide benefits to the entire value chain from producer to consumer. Through biotechnology. our farmers are able to grow more on less land using less water. less fuel. and less fertilizer. but the difficult issue we are debating today is about more than recognizing the fact that biotechnology is safe. No. today our decision is about whether to prevent a wrecking ball from hitting our entire food supply chain. The difficult issue for us to address is what to do about the patchwork of biotechnology labeling laws that will soon wreak havoc on the flow of interstate commerce. agriculture. and food products in every supermarket and every grocery store up and down Main Street of every community in America. That is what this is about. It is not about safety. it is not about health. and it is not about nutrition. It is all about marketing. What we face today is a handful of States that have chosen to enact labeling requirements on information that has nothing to do with health. safety. or nutrition. Unfortunately. the impact of these decisions will be felt all across the country. Those decisions impact the farmers in the fields who would be pressured to grow less efficient crops so manufacturers could avoid these demonizing labels. Those labeling laws will impact distributors who have to spend more money to sort different labels for different States. Those labeling laws will ultimately impact consumers who will suffer from higher priced food. It will cost $1.050 per year for an average family of four. That is right. If we do nothing. it is not manufacturers that will pay the ultimate price. it is the consumer. A study released this year found that changes in the production or labeling of most of the Nations food supply for a single State would impact citizens in each of our home States. The total annual increased cost of doing nothing today. such as not voting for cloture. could be as much as $82 billion every year. That is a pretty costly cloture vote. That is 1.050 bucks tacked onto each familys grocery bill. and that is a direct hit to their pocketbooks. Let me repeat that. If we fail to act todayif we do not have cloture and get to this compromise billthe cost to consumers would total as much as $82 billion a year or 1.050 bucks for hardworking American families. I dont think that is what my colleagues want. I dont think they want to be responsible for that: a cloture vote with an $82 billion price tag? Come on. This is the difficult issue we must address and the question is. How do we fix it? That is why we have crafted a compromise solution and put it on the floor for debate and action. The amendment before us today stops this wrecking ball before any more damage can be done. Two weeks ago. the Agriculture Committee passed a bill with a bipartisan vote of 14 to 6. I am very proud of that legislation. It stopped the StatebyState patchwork and provided a national voluntary standard for biotechnology food products. For the first time. the Federal Government would set a sciencebased standard allowing consumers to demand the marketplace provide more information. Consumers are growing more and more interested in their food. and that is a good thing. We. as consumers. should learn more about where our food comes from and what it takes to keep our food supply the safest. the most abundant. and the most affordable in the world. However. the role of government in this space is to ensure that information regarding safety. health. and nutritional value are expressed directly to consumers. but the information in question today has nothing to do with safety or health or nutrition. so the responsibility and opportunity to inform the consumers falls on the marketplace. If consumers want more information. they demand it by voting with their pocketbooks in the aisles of the grocery store. As our bipartisan bill has come to the floor. I have heard concerns that this voluntary standard is not enough for our consumers. Yet again we worked with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The legislation before us goes further than the committeepassed bill. This legislation addresses concerns with a voluntaryonly approach by providing an incentive for the marketplace to provide consumers with more information. To my friends on this side of the aisle. this legislation allows the market to work. To my friends on that side of the aisle. if the marketplace does not live up to their commitments. if information is not made available to consumers. then this legislation holds the markets accountable by instituting a mandatory standard. It is not just any mandatory standard. it is a standard that provides the same options and mechanisms for compliance as outlined and stated publicly by our Secretary of Agriculture. Tom Vilsack. Simply put. the legislation before us provides us an immediate and comprehensive solution to the unworkable StatebyState patchwork labeling laws. As chairman of the sometimes powerful Senate Agriculture Committee. I believe this is a true compromise. Like any bill. it is not perfect. and I know that. but to those who criticize this legislation in one breath and say they want a compromise in the next breath. I ask: Where is your plan? Where is your solution? We have heard the distinguished Senator from Oregon many times on this floornot a stranger to this floorcriticizing this compromise. I appreciate. and I am sure we all appreciate. his passion. I disagree with his views. but I appreciate that he did put his plan into a bill and put it out for public debate. What I dont understand is why he doesnt want to vote on it. Why would you put a bill out there and decide not to vote on it? Why would you not vote for cloture so you can get to a vote on your bill? We could have voted on his legislation today. Yet when he was presented with the option to take a vote. he declined. I have read the press release where he described the compromise as maintaining the status quo. If the truth be known. this compromise achieves just the opposite. In fact. voting no today is the only way that maintains the status quo. Voting no today does nothing to stop the wrecking ball. Voting no today ensures that the instability in the marketplace continues. Voting no today puts farmers and all of agriculture at risk. Voting no today negatively impacts the daily lives of everybody in the food chain from the farmer who will be forced to plant fence row to fence row of a crop that is less efficient to the grain elevator that will have to adjust storage options to separate the types of grain. to the manufacturer that will need different labels for different States. to the distributor that will need expanded storage for sorting. and to the retailer who may be unable to afford offering lowcost. privatelabel products. and. finally. to the consumer who will be forced to pay for all this additional cost to the tune of $82 billion. Now we come to our final task as elected officials of this body taking a vote. But before we do. we should all know that never beforenever before in my experience as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and all the years I have had the privilege to serve on both committeeswe have never seen a bill in the Agricultural Committee with so much support. never. Over 800 organizations all across the food and agriculture perspective have a stake in this bill. It is at the national and State and local levels. They all support the bill. The bill has the support of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. the American Farm Bureau. and many. many more. Virtually every farm group is in town. I just talked to the American Soybean Association this past week. One farmer said: Hey. if I cannot have agriculture biological crops with regard to increasing the yield that I plant. what am I going to do? Am I going to plant fence row to fence row? Am I going to lose in this situation when farming income is declining and farm credit is getting tighter? The fundamental role of the Agriculture Committee is to protect American farmers and ranchers who provide a safe. abundant. and affordable food supply to a very troubled and hungry world. So I will be voting yes to do just that. and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. Voting no today means telling your constituents next week that you are raising their grocery bill by over $1.000. Good luck with that. It is a pretty simple vote. You are either for agriculture or you are not. I yield the floor.
1140105423,"Mr. President. I come to the floor to talk about a topic and a bipartisan bill that will affect what consumers pay for their food. the grave threats of worldwide malnutrition and hunger. and the future of every farmer. every grower. and the future of every rancher in America. That topic is agriculture biotechnology. We have all heard about our growing global population. currently at 7 billion and estimated to reach over 9.6 billion in the next few decades. Tonight. 1 in 9 peoplethat is roughly 800 million peopleworldwide will go to bed hungry. Around the world. impoverished regions are facing increased challenges in feeding their people. Show me a nation that cannot feed itself. and I will show you a nation in chaos. Goodness knows. we have had enough of that. We have seen too many examples in recent years where shortfalls in grain and other food items or increases in prices at the consumer level have helped to trigger outbreaks of civil unrest and protests in places such as the Middle East and Africa. In light of these global security threats. todays farmers are being asked to produce more safe and affordable food to meet the demands at home and around the globe. At the same time. farmers are facing increased challenges to their production. including limited land and water resources. uncertain weather. to be sure. and pest and disease issues. However. over the past 20 years. agriculture biotechnology has become an invaluable tool in ensuring the success of the American farmer in meeting the challenge of increasing yield in a more efficient. safe. and responsible manner. For years now. the United States has proven that American agriculture plays a pivotal role in addressing food shortfalls around the world. We must continue to consider new and innovative ways to get ahead of the growing population and production challenges. In addressing these issues. we must continue to be guided by the best available science. research. and innovation. If my colleagues have heard any of my previous remarks on this topic. they have heard me say time and again that biotechnology products are safe. My colleagues dont have to take my word for it. The Agriculture Committee held a hearing late last year where all three agencies in charge of reviewing biotechnology testified before our members. Over and over again. the EPA. the FDA. and the USDA told us that these products are safethat they are safe for the environment. safe for other plants. and certainly safe for our food supply. Since that hearing. the U.S. Government reinforced their decisions on the safety of these products. Last November. the FDA took several steps. based on sound science. regarding food that is produced from biotech plants. including issuing final guidance for manufacturers who wish to voluntarily label their products as containing ingredients from biotech or exclusively nonbiotech plants. More importantly. the Food and Drug Administration denied a petition that would have required the mandatory onpackage labeling of biotech foods. The FDA maintained that evidence was not provided for the agency to put such a requirement in place because there is no health safety or nutritional difference between biotech crops and their nonbiotech varieties. A recent report from the National Academy of Sciences ""found no substantiated evidence of a difference in risks to human health between current commercially available genetically engineered crops and conventionally bred crops."" Just last week. 110 Nobel laureates sent an open letter to the leaders of Greenpeace. the United Nations. and all governments around the world in support of agriculture biotechnology. and particularly in support of golden rice. Golden rice has the potentialhas had the potential and has the potentialto reduce or eliminate much of the death and disease caused by a vitamin A deficiency. particularly among the poorest people in Africa and Southeast Asia. These worldrenowned scientists noted that ""scientific and regulatory agencies around the world have repeatedly and consistently found crops and foods improved through biotechnology to be as safe as. if not safer. than those derived from any other method of production."" Furthermore. the laureates said: There has never been a single confirmed case of a negative health outcome for humans or animals from their consumption. Their environmental impacts have been shown repeatedly to be less damaging to the environment. and a boon to global biodiversity. There has been a lot of discussion about agriculture biotechnology lately. and that is a good thing. We should be talking about our food. We should be talking about our farmers and producers. and we should be talking to consumers. It is important to have an honest discussion and an open exchange of dialogue. After all. that is what we do in the Senatediscuss difficult issues. craft solutions. and finally vote in the best interests of our constituents. The difficult issue for us to address is what to do about the patchwork of biotechnology labeling laws that soon will wreak havoc on the flow of interstate commerce of agriculture and food products in every supermarket and every grocery store up and down every Main Street. That is what this discussion should be about. It is not about safety or health or nutrition. it is all about marketing. If we dont act today. what we will face is a handful of States that have chosen to enact labeling requirements on information that has nothing to do with health. safety. or nutrition. Unfortunately. the impact of those State decisions will be felt across the country and around the globe. Those decisions impact the farmers who would be pressured to grow less efficient crops so manufacturers could avoid these demonizing labels. Those labeling laws will impact distributors who have to spend more money to sort different labels for different States. Those labeling laws will ultimately impact consumers. who will suffer from much higher priced food. When onpackage labels force manufacturers to reformulate food products. our farmers will have limited biotechnology options available. This will result in less food available to the many mouths in our troubled and hungry world. It is not manufacturers who pay the ultimate price. it is the consumerat home and around the globewho will bear this burden. unless we act today. I am proud of the critical role the Department of Agriculture has played and will continue to play in combating global hunger. Farmers and ranchers in Kansas. Michigan. and all across this country have been and are committed to continue to doing their part. And those of us who represent them in the U.S. Senate should do our part to stand up in defense of sound science and innovation. We should stand up to ensure that our farmers and ranchers have access to agriculture biotechnology and other tools to address these global challenges. The proposal put forth by my distinguished ranking member Senator STABENOW and me provides that defense of our food system and our farmers and ranchers. while at the same time providing a reasonable solution to consumer demand for more information. That is what the bill does. Our amendment strikes a careful balance. It certainly is not perfect from my perspective. It is not the best possible bill. but it is the best bill possible under these difficult circumstances we find ourselves in today. That is why. I say to my colleagues. it is supported by a broad coalition of well over 1.000 food and agriculture industries. and that sets a record in the Senate Agriculture Committee. They include the American Farm Bureau Federation. Grocery Manufacturers Association. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. just to name a few. I urge my colleagues to not merely support cloture on a bill this afternoon but to support your broad range of constituents who benefit from its passage. Passing this bill benefits farmers and ranchers by providing a mechanism for disclosure that educates rather than denigrates their technology. Passing this bill benefits manufacturers by providing a single national standard by which to be held accountable. rather than an unworkable system of many more State standards. Finally. passing this bill benefits consumers by greatly increasing the amount of food information at their fingertips but does so in a way that provides costeffective options to avoid devastating increases in the price of food. Passing this bill is the responsible thing to do. It is time for us to act. I urge my colleagues to join us in doing just that. I yield the floor."

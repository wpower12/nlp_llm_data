1130015636,"Mr. Speaker. in November 2012. Puerto Rico held a referendum on its political status. The results demonstrated that a clear majority of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico want to end the islands current territory status. that a supermajority prefers statehood among the possible alternatives. and thatfor the first time in historymore voters favor statehood than the current status. As I have remarked before. not a single one of my stateside colleagues in Congress would accept territory status for their own constituents. So they must recognize and respect that the American citizens of Puerto Rico no longer accept it either. I also trust that my colleagues who represent States will credit my constituents for aspiring to have the same rights and responsibilities as their constituents. Last week. the President took an important step. As part of the proposed budget the administration submitted to Congress. the Justice Department is seeking $2.5 million to conduct the first Federally sponsored vote on Puerto Ricos political status in the 115 years that the territory has been under the U.S. flag. The funding would be granted to Puerto Ricos Elections Commission to conduct objective voter education and a vote on ""options that would resolve Puerto Ricos future political status."" Key congressional leaders in the House and the Senate. Republican and Democrat alike. have already issued statements of support for the Presidents action. calling it an appropriate response to the local referendum. Mr. Speaker. my constituents may not have a vote in the government that makes their national laws. but they do have a voiceand they made that voice heard loud and clear in November. A budget reflects ones priorities and values. I support the Presidents budget because it shows respect for the democratically expressed aspirations of the U.S. citizens who reside in Puerto Rico. And it demonstrates a clear desire to move forward on this complex but critical issue. As the budget request states. the Federally sponsored vote is to be among options that would resolve Puerto Ricos political status. The only way to resolve the islands status is through statehood or national sovereignty. Puerto Rico cannot resolve its status by maintaining the same undemocratic status that my people have endured since 1898 and that they soundly rejected in November. The current status is the root cause of Puerto Ricos political. economic. and social problems. so it cannot also be the solution to those problems. In addition. the budget language clearly states that the Department of Justice shall not provide funding until it certifies that the ballot and voter education materials are consistent with the Constitution. basic laws. and policies of the United States. The purpose of this language is to ensure that the ballot does not include impossible status proposals that have been repeatedly declared unworkable as a matter of both law and policy by the Federal Government. I am pleased that the administration understands that true selfdetermination is a choice among options that can be implemented. not an exercise in wishful thinking. The Presidents request represents one path forward. but it is important to underscore that it is not the only path forward. In the coming weeks. I will introduce standalone legislation on the status issue that will both complement President Obamas request and reflect the undisputable fact that statehood won the November referendum. Puerto Rico stands in a far different place today than it did six months ago. A historic referendum was held. the President responded to the results. and Congress now has a responsibility to act. Those who seek democracy. equality. and progress for Puerto Rico are on the forward march. while those who support the failed status quo are in retreat. We drive the debate. while they merely react to the debate. And. in the end. mindful that the arc of history is long but that it bends towards justice. I am confident we will prevail."
1130021263,"Mr. Speaker. today. joined by a bipartisan group of my colleagues. I am introducing the Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act. This bill is a response to the results of a referendum held in Puerto Rico in November. The first question asked voters if they support Puerto Ricos current territory status. which deprives my constituents of the most fundamental democratic rights. Fiftyfour percent said ""no."" The second question asked voters for their preference among the three alternatives to the current territory status. Of those who chose an option. 61 percent favored statehood. More voters said they want Puerto Rico to become a State than to maintain the current status. which is unprecedented. The White House has recognized the importance of the results. which is why the President is seeking an appropriation to conduct the first federally authorized vote in Puerto Ricos history. intended to ""resolve"" the territorys future status. The legislation I am filing today is consistent with the Presidents budget request and serves as a blueprint for how the vote conducted pursuant to that appropriation could be structured. After outlining the rights and responsibilities of statehood. the bill authorizes a ratification vote on whether Puerto Rico should be admitted into the Union as a State. If a majority of voters affirm Puerto Ricos desire for statehood. the bill provides for the President to submit legislation to admit Puerto Rico as a State after a reasonable transition period. The bill also expresses Congresss commitment to act on such legislation. Now. I want to speak directly to the men and women who voted for statehood in November. Our movement has become a predominant force in Puerto Rico. Every day. we grow stronger. Like you. I believe that justice delayed is justice denied. And. like you. I find it difficult to be patient. But we fight with our heads as well as our hearts. Perfecting our Union requires passion. but it also demands perseverance. There are no shortcuts on the path to statehood. and politicians who suggest there are are leading us to a dead end. The statehood movement is powerful because we are united by a single principle. the principle of equality. The November vote has fortified our spirit and renewed our sense of purpose. We will not shy away from a fight. History teaches that once a people have chosen democracy. selfgovernment and progress. they are unlikely to reverse course. Rest assured. now that the people of Puerto Rico have withdrawn their consent to secondclass citizenship. the question is not whether. but when. Puerto Rico will obtain equality through statehood. To my colleagues who represent States. I know you will respect my constituents for seeking the same rights and responsibilities as your constituents. This respect must take the form of concrete action. The U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico have made their choices heard. and they deserve a meaningful response from their national government. There is overwhelming evidence that territory status has affected Puerto Ricos political. economic. and social development. and it has become clear that the status quo does not serve the national interest. either. The U.S. succeeds when Puerto Rico succeeds. when the island is strong. stable and secure. and when its residents do not feel obligated to relocate to the States to achieve their dreams. From the U.S. perspective. a robust and resilient State of Puerto Rico would advance the national interest. The position of every President since Harry Truman has been that their administration would accept whatever status choice is made by a majority of Puerto Ricos voters. The U.S. Government is a champion of democracy and selfdetermination around the world. and it must adhere to those principles with respect to its own citizens. This is essentially true in light of the service that generations of men and women from Puerto Rico have rendered to this Nation. most notably in the Armed Forces. but in so many other ways as well. In a very real sense. Puerto Rico has earned the right to be equal. and equal we will become. Puerto Rico has been called the shining star of the Caribbean. The time has come for our star to shine. alongside the others. on the Flag of the United States of America."
1130031539,Mr. Chair. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii. Ms. GABBARD. This amendment establishes a coffee plant health initiative to be led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. with the goal of addressing the pressing needs of the coffee industry in the United States. The U.S. coffee industry is principally based in my district. Puerto Rico. and in the State of Hawaii. given that both jurisdictions offer natural conditions ideally suited for cultivation of the coffee crop. The industry in both Puerto Rico and Hawaii is increasingly threatened by a nonnative insect commonly known as the coffee berry borer or the Broca del Caf6 in Spanish. This agricultural pest arrived in Puerto Rico in 2007 and in Hawaii in 2010. The insect has emerged as the primary threat facing the coffee industry. adversely impacting both the yield and the market value of coffee crops. The insect damages coffee plants by boring and depositing eggs into the berries. The larvae then hatch inside the berries and feed on the coffee beans. destroying them by creating holes. The Agricultural Research Service estimates that the coffee berry borer has caused over $500 million in losses worldwide. In Puerto Rico. production of coffee has recently fallen to an historic low. and the coffee berry borer is partially responsible. Annual coffee production in Puerto Rico is now valued at $21 million. less than half of what it was just five years ago and about a third of what it was at its peak in the mid1 990s. Most hard hit are the rural and mountainous municipalities where coffee has traditionally been a cash cropAdjuntas. Lares. Utuado. Maricao. Jayuya. Yauco. Orocovis. Ciales. Las Marfas. and San Sebastian. Why should we care about this situation? Because without a coffee berry borerfree and controlled environment in which to plant coffee trees. our agricultural economies in Puerto Rico and Hawaii are in jeopardy. This means higher unemployment. reduced exports and increased reliance on imports. Simply put. we must protect the U.S. interests in this worldwide commodity. So research on the coffee berry borer should be made a high priority at the USDA. This amendment is relevant not only to residents of Puerto Rico and Hawaii. but also to millions of coffee consumers around the country. who should be able to enjoy Americanmade coffee. such as Puerto Ricos 58 gourmet brands or the world famous coffee from the Big Island in Hawaii. Economically speaking. the United States benefits if we can increase the worldwide market share and quality of coffee that is produced in Puerto Rico and in Hawaii. The latest statistics available reveal that my constituents consume about 30 million pounds of coffee each year. Local production in Puerto Rico. though. is roughly 10 million pounds. leaving 20 million to be importedtypically from countries in the Caribbean and Central America. Since the berry borer emerged as a threat in Puerto Rico and Hawaii. the local governments in these two jurisdictions have worked diligently with farmers and the extension agents of our land grant universities to control the spread of the insect and to mitigate its impact. However. more must be done. Now that the insect is affecting more than just one jurisdiction. a Federal response is especially appropriate. The amendment requires USDA to develop and provide sciencebased tools and treatments to combat the coffee berry borer and to establish areawide integrated pest management programs in Puerto Rico. Hawaii. and anywhere else in the U.S. that the coffee berry borer may affect. USDA would be authorized to collaborate with the landgrant universities of Puerto Rico and Hawaii. as well as with the state governments and outside organizations. to carry out scientific research and to develop and implement the integrated pest management programs. For years. USDA has sponsored applied research targeted toward the Nations most challenging agricultural pests and diseases. Targeted research has spanned the range of commodities and crops. The needs in tropical and subtropical agriculture are many. and the needs facing our coffee industry are pressing. Cutting edge research continues to be conducted at the U.S. Tropical Agriculture Research Station in Mayagiez. Puerto Rico. and at the U.S. Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Hilo. Hawaii. by a cadre of dedicated scientists. technicians. and agronomists. This amendment is designed to buttress their mission and to give them the authority in law they need to expand their work to help local producers. The amendment also improves the capacity of the landgrant universities to address the problems presented by the coffee berry borer. Finally. I would note that the research conducted at the ARS research stations and by the landgrant universities in Puerto Rico and Hawaii has national application. The techniques and technology developed there have proven their utility for increasing food production and controlling agricultural pests in the U.S. mainland. The research that stands to be enhanced through this amendment has a high probability of application benefiting agricultural production beyond coffee and beyond Puerto Rico and Hawaii. For these reasons. I urge adoption of the amendment and I thank my colleague. Ms. GABBARD. for her leadership in bringing it forward for consideration. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma . The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
1130040779,Mr. Chairman. this budgetneutral amendment. which I offer with Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. would enable DOD to remove unexploded ordnance from land in Culebra. Puerto Rico. which was used as a military training range for seven decades. In 1974. Congress enacted legislation directing the Navy to cease operations in Culebra. A provision stated that the present bombardment area shall not be utilized for any purpose that would require decontamination at the expense of the United States. In 1982. the Federal Government conveyed land in Culebra to the Government of Puerto Rico. including a 400acre parcel within the former bombardment area. The deed provided that. in accordance with the 1974 act. the Government of Puerto Rico would not hold the Federal Government liable for decontamination of the land. Four years later. in 1986. Congress enacted SARA. which amended the 1980 CERCLA law. SARA states that DOD is responsible for cleaning up contamination it caused on current and former military sites and established the Defense Environmental Restoration Program for DOD to carry out these responsibilities. That program is funded by the bill under consideration today. SARA directed DOD to clean up former defense sites conveyed to third parties prior to 1986. These sites are eligible for Federal funding. even though there were no specific authorities enabling their cleanup at the time they were decommissioned and conveyed. Nevertheless. DOD contends that the 1974 law and the 1982 deed that tracks it prohibits the use of Federal funds to decontaminate the 400acre parcel on Culebra. and these prohibitions were not superceded by SARA. As a result of this restrictive interpretation. Culebra is the only former defense site in the Nation that DOD contends it is barred by statute from decontaminating. This makes no sense. The 1974 act and the 1982 deed may have been consistent with Federal policy at that time since there was no legal framework in place that would have enabled the Federal Government to pay for the cleanup of the conveyed property. However. theyre now squarely at odds with Federal policy that has been in place for more than 25 years under SARA. Accordingly. theres no principled basis to treat Culebra differently from thousands of other former defense sites conveyed out of Federal hands prior to 1986 which the Federal Government is obligated to decontaminate. The status quo poses a threat to human safety since this parcel contains beaches. walkways. and campgrounds visited by over 300.000 people a year. A recent DOD report found that since 1995. there have been 70 incidents in which members of the public encountered unexploded munitions that could have caused great harm. In fact. in March of this year. a young girl visiting a Culebra beach suffered burns after she picked up an artillery shell containing white phosphorous. The FBI responded and found six other munitions which it detonated and removed. This potentially tragic incident underscores the need for congressional action. This amendment would ensure that the 1974 act ceases to function as an obstacle to implementation of current Federal policy. as reflected in CERCLA and SARA. The amendment simply ensures that Culebra will receive the same treatment as other former defense sites in the FUDS program. The citizens in Culebra sacrificed so our military could receive the training it needed. Congress. in turn. should take this small step to remove the barrier that is preventing DOD from addressing safety hazards that remain on the island. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130057148,"Mr. Speaker. Monday marked the 10th anniversary of the passing of Luis Ferre. I rise this morning to pay tribute to this giant of a man whom The New York Times called the ""dominant force in the politics. economy and culture of Puerto Rico. for much of the 20th century. In a real sense. Don Luis personified his beloved Puerto Rico. embodying both its progress and its struggles. He was born in Ponce in 1904. a few years after Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory. was a teenager when island residents were granted American citizenship in 1917. served as a delegate to the convention that drafted Puerto Ricos local constitution in the early 1950s. was elected as the islands governor in 1968. served as a member of the Puerto Rico Senate. including as its president. in the late 1970s and early 1980s. and remained engaged in public life as a revered elder statesman well beyond his formal retirement from politics. Don Luis lived to age 99. but it was the fullness of his life. not its length. that is so remarkable. Trained as an engineer at MIT and as a classical pianist at the New England Conservatory of Music. Ferre was a true renaissance man. He loved ideas. intellectual debate and culture. founding the renowned Ponce Museum of Art. but he was also at home in the practical world of business. taking a small company and transforming it into one of Puerto Ricos most successful conglomerates. He published a newspaper. now called El Nuevo Dia. which is run by his grandchildren. and has the largest circulation of any periodical on the island. Don Luis was also a committed philanthropist. who took to heart the biblical axiom: to whom much is given. much is expected. In 1991. Ferre was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. the Nations highest civilian honor. by President George H.W. Bush. who called Ferre ""a public servant of the first order"" and an ""extraordinary leader in the life of Puerto Rico."" On a personal level. Ferre refuted the notion that great men are seldom good men. Like any effective leader. he was tough when he needed to be. but he was also kind. warm and generous. inspiring affection and loyalty as well as respect. Don Luis was a gentleman through and through. He was ""old school"" in the best sense of the term. Few. if any. Puerto Ricans have accomplished as much in their lives as Don Luis or have left behind such a lasting legacy. A proud Republican and founder of the local New Progressive Party. Ferre did not live to see his goal of statehood for Puerto Rico realized. but he encouraged and mentored a new generation of leaders who understand that Puerto Ricos ""colonial status."" as Don Luis called it. deprives island residents of political and civil rights. hinders their economic progress and harms their quality of life. As I and other prostatehood advocates work to perfect Puerto Ricos union with the U.S.. we are guided by Don Luis example and draw strength from his memory. Ferre once described himself as revolutionary in his ideas. liberal in his objectives. and conservative in his methods. Thanks to Don Luis and others. statehood is no longer a revolutionary idea. It has become the predominant force in Puerto Rico politics while support for the status quo continues to decline and support for separate nationhood remains slight. Last November. a clear majority of voters in Puerto Rico rejected territory status. and more voters expressed a preference for statehood than for any other status option. I wish Don Luis had been alive to witness this historic event. When Puerto Rico does become a state. as I know it will. we will look back upon Luis Ferres life and say that this man. as much as any other man. was responsible for this crowning achievement."
1130060328,"Madam Speaker. Monday was Veterans Day. when our Nation pays tribute to those who have served honorably in the Armed Forces. Today. I rise to express my gratitude to the soldiers. sailors. airmen. and marines from Puerto Rico. both those who are living and those who have left us. Since World War I almost a century ago to Afghanistan today. American citizens from Puerto Rico have built a rich record of military service. If you visit any U.S. base. you will see warriors from Puerto Rico fighting to keep this Nation safe. strong. and free. They serve as officers and enlisted personnel. as special operators. in infantry. artillery. and armored units. as pilots and aviation technicians. in intelligence. on ships and submarines. in combat support positions. and in every military specialty. In his book. ""Puerto Ricos Future: A Time to Decide."" former U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh observed: Historically. Puerto Rico has ranked alongside the top five States in terms of per capita military service. In the forward to that book. former President George H.W. Bush noted: This patriotic service and sacrifice of Americans from Puerto Rico touched me all the more deeply for the very fact they have served with such devotion. even while denied a vote for the President and Members of Congress who determine when. where. and how they are asked to defend our freedoms. As I address this Chamber. men and women from Puerto Rico are serving in harms way in Afghanistan and other locations. Since the attacks of 9111. island residents have deployed about 35.000 times in overseas contingency operations. Many have deployed on multiple occasions. Each time they go. they leave behind spouses. children. and parents. As veterans will tell you. military life requires enormous sacrifice from their loved ones. those quiet heroes who support our uniformed personnel who must live and work in their absence and who pray for their safe return. On Veterans Day. we honor not only those who fought. but their families. as well. There is a frame on my office wall containing photographs of servicemembers from Puerto Rico that have fallen in the last 12 years. I often look at those photos. row after row of young faces. usually posing in their dress uniforms against the backdrop of the American flag. Those images make me sad. but they also give me strength. They inspire me to keep working for my people. They remind me what courage is and what sacrifice means. And they help me remember why representing Puerto Rico in Congress is the greatest honor I have ever known. I have met many veterans from Puerto Rico. I have found that they value deeds over words. They expect their elected leaders to produce results. or at least to work tirelessly towards that end. I am proud of the record we have compiled on behalf of veterans from Puerto Rico. We have obtained funding to renovate the VA hospital in San Juan. to improve existing clinics and build new clinics throughout the island. and to provide vehicles so that residents of our State veterans home can visit their families and travel to medical appointments. We also achieved Puerto Ricos inclusion in a Federal initiative to encourage the hiring of unemployed veterans. And I am working to honor a military unit that perhaps best exemplifies the service that residents of Puerto Rico have rendered to this Nation. Congressman BILL POSEY of Florida and I have introduced legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the 65th Infantry Regiment known as the Borinqueneers. a unit composed mostly of soldiers from Puerto Rico that overcame discrimination and won admiration for their performance in the Korean war. Our bill has nearly 160 bipartisan cosponsors. and there is a companion bill in the Senate that has also garnered strong support. I hope all my colleagues will join me in honoring this special group of veterans. This Veterans Day. I renewed my commitment to fight for the men and women who have fought so valiantly for us. and I thank them from the bottom of my heart for their service. I do so again today."
1130076250,"Mr. Speaker. yesterday. the junior Senator from Mississippi and the junior Senator from West Virginia spoke on the Senate floor about Puerto Ricos political status. Because Puerto Rico is a territory and not a State. we have no Senators who can respond to these two Senators on the Senate floor. So. as the only elected representative in Congress of the 3.6 million U.S. citizens that live in Puerto Rico. I respond now. The Senators discussed the referendum that was held in Puerto Rico in November 2012. However. neither Senator mentioned that. on the first question in that referendum. 54 percent of voters said they do not want Puerto Rico to be a territory. which means that my constituents no longer consent to the current status. Likewise. neither Senator noted that. during a Senate hearing on the referendum held last August. the senior Democrat and the senior Republican on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources agreed that it was indisputable and clear that the people of Puerto Rico oppose the current territory status. Finally. in their remarks yesterday. neither Senator acknowledged that in the referendum. statehood received more votes than any other status option. including the current status. In short. the Senators discussion of the historic referendum was clearly deficient. In addition. both Senators expressed opposition to the Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act. which I introduced last year in the House and which was introduced earlier this month in the Senate. The two Senators have every right to oppose this legislation. which calls for an upordown vote in Puerto Rico on the territorys admission as a State and outlines the steps the Federal Government would take if a majority of voters favor admission. But to argue. as the Senators did. that the bill excludes other options other than statehood makes no sense. A binary vote. by definition. is not exclusive. Those who support statehood can vote ""yes."" and those who oppose it can vote ""no."" This was precisely the format of the votes that led to Hawaii and Alaska becoming States. I ask the Senators: Do you believe those earlier votes were unfair or exclusionary? In any event. there are now 132 Members of the House and Senate who have cosponsored the Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act and. therefore. disagree with these two Senators characterization of the bill. Both Senators sought to contrast their opposition to the Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act with their apparent support for a Puerto Ricorelated appropriation that the President included in his fiscal year 2014 budget request at my urging. and that recently became law. Under this appropriation. funding would be provided for the first federally sponsored vote in Puerto Ricos history. to be held among one or more options that are consistent with U.S. law and policy and that would ""resolve"" the status issue. Contrary to the suggestion made by both Senators. a vote on Puerto Ricos admission as a State is a perfectly valid and logical way to structure the federally sponsored plebiscite to be held pursuant to this appropriation. Both Senators also expressed the view that the status debate is a ""distraction"" from efforts to tackle Puerto Ricos economic and fiscal challenges. This argument is familiar. but it is false. The reality is that Puerto Ricos economic problems are structural in nature and are rooted in the territorys unequal and undemocratic status. No wonder my constituents are relocating to the States in unprecedented numbers. I look forward to the day when the men. women. and children I represent have the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow U.S. citizens residing in the States that the two Senators represent. We do not seek special treatment. We seek equality. and we intend to achieve it."
1130093811,Madam Chair. I rise in support of my amendment to enable DOD to remove unexploded ordnance from certain areas on the island of Culebra. Puerto Rico. which was used as a military training range for decades. Under the FUDS program. the Army Corps of Engineers is decontaminating limited areas of Culebra. However. DOD asserts that a 1974 law prohibits the use of Federal funds to decontaminate land that constituted the bombardment zone. Approximately 400 acres of this land were conveyed to the government of Puerto Rico in 1982 for use as a public park. DOD contends that the 1974 law has not been superseded by Federal cleanup authorities enacted in 1986. As a result of this rigid interpretation. Culebra is the only former defense site of several thousand across the United States that DOD claims it is barred by statute from decontaminating. The resulting state of affairs poses a direct threat to public safety. since this land encompasses popular beaches. campgrounds and a trail. In a congressionallyrequired study. DOD reported that there have been many incidents where members of the public encountered unexploded munitions that could have caused serious harm. My amendment would authorize the Corps of Engineers to decontaminate those areas within the 400acre parcel where the risk to public safety is the greatest. It will ensure that the 1974 Act ceases to serve as an obstacle to implementation of current Federal policy. which provides that the federal government is responsible for cleaning lands that were contaminated as a result of its actions. The amendment ensures that Culebra will be treated the sameno better and no worsethan other formerly used defense sites. The U.S. citizens living in Culebra sacrificed so that our military could receive the training it required. Congress. in turn. should now take this small step to enable DOD to remove unexploded munitions from the island. I thank the Committee leadership and. in particular. the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. WITTMAN. for working with me on this issue.
1130109087,"Madam Speaker. I rise to provide an update on Puerto Ricos political status. which is an issue of national significance. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. Territory status is undemocratic. Although Puerto Rico is home to more American citizens than 21 States. island residents cannot vote for President. are not represented in the Senate. and have one nonvoting Delegate in the House. Territory status is also unequal. As a recent GAO report confirms. Puerto Rico is deprived of billions of dollars each year because it is treated worse than the States under a range of Federal programs. Every objective observer understands that territory status is the underlying cause of the economic. fiscal. and demographic crisis that has enveloped Puerto Rico. History teaches a simple lesson: no people have ever reached their potential while being deprived of political rights and denied equality under the law. Puerto Rico is no exception to this rule. If the people of Puerto Rico wish to discard territory status. there are twoand only twopaths forward. The territory can become a State on equal footing with the other States. or the territory can become a sovereign nation. either fully independent from the U.S.. like the Philippines. or with a compact of free association with the U.S. that either nation can terminate. like the Republic of Palau. If Puerto Rico becomes a sovereign nation. future generations of island residents would not be American citizens and would receive reduced Federal support. In a 2012 referendum sponsored by the Government of Puerto Rico. a majority of my constituents expressed their opposition to territory status. which means that Puerto Rico is being governed without its consent. Statehood received more votes than territory status. which is unprecedented. And statehood obtained far more votes than either of the two nationhood options. which demonstrates that Puerto Rico has no desire to weaken or break the bonds forged with the United States over nearly 12 decades. At my urging and in response to this landmark vote. the Obama administration proposed an appropriation of $2.5 million to fund the first federally sponsored referendum in Puerto Ricos history with the stated goal being to resolve the territorys status. Earlier this year. Congress approved this appropriation with bipartisan support. Although the law does not specify how the ballot should be structured. it does require the Department of Justice to ensure that any option on the ballot is compatible with the Constitution. laws. and public policy of the United States. Therefore. the ballot cannot contain the status proposal known as ""enhanced commonwealth"" that one political party in Puerto Rico has consistently put forward over the years and that Federal officialsincluding the Obama administration. Senators WYDEN and MURKOWSKIhave just as consistently rejected as impossible. Moreover. the ballot should not contain the current territory status as an option because it was rejected in the 2012 referendum. It is the primary source of Puerto Ricos problems. and it does not resolve the islands status since. as long as Puerto Rico remains a territory. it has the potential to become either a State or a sovereign nation. Last week. the Governor of Puerto Rico announced his intention to use the $2.5 million to conduct a federally sponsored vote by the end of 2016. I have proposed that the Federal funding be used to hold a yesorno vote on whether Puerto Rico should be admitted as a State. just as Alaska and Hawaii did. This approach would yield a definitive result that nobody could reasonably question. and it has broad congressional backing. garnering support from 135 Members of the House and the Senate. If the Governor of Puerto Rico resists this approach. he will face a problem. The party he leads has never been able to agree upon a status proposal that does not conflict with U.S. law and policy. But let me be clear. If a vote does occur. statehood advocates will show up in force. Any time. any place. an army of men and women will be there to seek equality and justice. and we will prevail."

1140001889,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today. along with my colleagues. to honor the life and legacy of Governor Mario Cuomo who passed away on January 1 at the age of 82. When we think of Governor Cuomo. we think of him along with his sonnow Governor Andrew Cuomoand then his counsel Tim Russert from Buffalo driving in a car. riding from the airport to the Moscone Center in San Francisco. still writing new sections of his historic keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention which catapulted him forever as a prominent figure within the Democratic Party. Less remembered than his speeches but just as admirable were his writings. He wrote extensively on the American Dream his immigrant parents achieved. and the numerous causes that he cared about. ""Diaries of Mario M. Cuomo."" ""Reason to Believe."" Why Lincoln Matters."" and ""More Than Words."" which is a collection of 31 speeches he wrote going back to 1974. As a student of government. a teacher of government. and now as a practitioner. in 2006. I went to see Governor Cuomo. former Governor Cuomo. who was practicing law in Manhattan at a place called Willkie. Farr. and Gallagher. Remember. I had 15 minutes scheduled with him and left 2 hours later. I told him that his writings. going back to 1974. were as relevant today as they were when they were written. They were timeless. they were classics. My favorite story is the one that he told about how he came to edit the book. ""Lincoln on Democracy."" In 1988. Governor Cuomo met in Albany with a delegation from the teacher section of Polands Solidarity Union. which was the leading advocate for bringing democracy to Poland when it was under Communist rule. The teachers told the Governor that they were building an archive of influential and insightful writings on democracy. They asked if he could recommend writings by American thinkers that had influenced his approach to public service and democracy. Cuomo immediately identified Abraham Lincoln as his favorite source of wisdom. The Polish delegation said. ""Governor. Lincolns writings and speeches are not available in Poland."" In fact. they were banned. Cuomo promised to give them the speeches that they needed in order to appreciate what he had come to appreciate in Lincoln. Cuomo says. ""Delegation. come over here."" He pulled out the 378page index of the collected works of Abraham Lincolnnot one mention of democracy in those works. so together with Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer. he wrote. edited. and published ""Lincoln on Democracy."" a book that to this day is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the uniquely American approach to democracy and governance. True to his word. the Polish version of the book appeared in Warsaw in early 1990 before its English version was available in the United States. Mario Cuomos gift was that he forced us to think for ourselves. He forced us to consider our history. and he forced us to recognize our responsibility to build a foundation that is better than the foundation that those who came before us built for us. That is the true meaning of the American Dream. and it was embodied by a unique individual who was an unlikely successful lawyer. an unlikely Governor of New York. Mario M. Cuomo."
1140008351,I thank the gentleman from California for bringing this issue to the House floor. underscoring the urgency of investing. through the National Institutes of Health. proper funding to find a cause and. thus. a cure for Alzheimers. As the gentleman said. 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimers. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Death from Alzheimers increased 68 percent between the years 2000 and 2010. while deaths from other major diseases decreased. The cost to the United States is over $200 billion a year. Without a breakthrough. treatment will cost $1 trillion a year by the year 2050. We are still seeking an adequate level of funding. For every $100 that the National Institutes of Health spends on Alzheimers research. Medicare and Medicaid spend $26.000 caring for those who have the disease. In Congress we have two pieces of legislation: the Alzheimers Accountability Act. which would ensure that Federal priorities and goals for Alzheimers research actually reflect what scientists believe is needed. and the HOPE for Alzheimers Act. which would provide Medicare coverage for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimers disease and for care planning of newly diagnosed Americans. But all of this. as the gentleman from California pointed out. becomes localized and becomes very personal. The origins of Alzheimers are unknown. but the end is absolutely certain. It ends in losing your cognitive ability. your dignity. and. ultimately. your life. In western New York. we have approximately 130.000 people who are impacted by Alzheimers: 32.000 people who are afflicted. and 96.000 who love and provide care for the afflicted. That number is expected to triple by 2015. The Alzheimers Association of Western New York works yearround to highlight the effect of Alzheimers disease and to help people and caregivers touched by this disease. One of the people who was touched by this disease is Nancy Swiston. a constituent who lost her mom. Grace Swiston. who bravely fought the disease for 10 long years. Today. Nancy volunteers with the Alzheimers Association of Western New York to be a voice for those suffering from the disease and the families who care for those with Alzheimers. Nancys story is one of too many families across the Nation we share. but we commit to fighting with her to raise awareness in funding for a cure that we will all embrace one day. I thank the gentleman from California again for committing us to this important issue.
1140056195,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. and rise in support of H.R. 3493. Securing the Cities Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker. the Securing the Cities program is a grant and technical assistance program administered by the Department of Homeland Securitys Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. Since its inception nearly a decade ago. the Securing the Cities program has provided thousands of first responders with the tools they need to detect radiological and nuclear threats. Started as a pilot project in 2006 in the New York City. Newark. and New Jersey metropolitan areas. the program has grown to include Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2012. and the Washington. D.C.. Federal district in 2014. This year. the program has identified Houston and Chicago as highpriority areas for expanding the program. Under the program. the initial grant award is generally used for planning and analysis at a regional level. with subsequent grants going towards equipment. training. and exercises. Importantly. through the Securing the Cities program. the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is able to channel subjectmatter expertise. training coordination. and technical support to all the identified highrisk metropolitan areas. H.R. 3493. like the bill I introduced that will be next to be considered. is targeted at bolstering the security of our communities from the threat of a nuclear attack. As such. Mr. Speaker. I urge support of H.R. 3493. We have an opportunity today to take action to bolster our defense against rogue actors and terrorists who would seek to detonate a nuclear device on U.S. soil. The disclosure in recent weeks of a thwarted plot by Moldovan operatives to provide smuggled nuclear materials to terrorist organizations with ambition to attack the United States has crystallized the need for action. Today. we can take such action. By approving H.R. 3493 and authorizing the Securing the Cities program. we will be enhancing the Nations ability to detect and prevent a radiological and nuclear attack in cities facing the highest risk. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140056206,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 3350. the Know the CBRN Terrorism Threats to Transportation Act. Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. KING of New York. Chairman MCCAUL. and my ranking member. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. for their support of my bill. H.R. 3350. the Know the CBRN Terrorism Threats to Transportation Act. would direct the Department of Homeland Securitys Office of Intelligence and Analysis to conduct a terrorism threat assessment of the risks associated with transportation of chemical. biological. nuclear. and radiological materials. Terrorists and militant groups have expressed an interest in using weapons of mass destruction. especially those utilizing chemical. biological. radiological. and nuclear. known as CBRN. agents or materials. In fact. according to a recent Associated Press investigation. the FBI uncovered a plot by rogue Moldavian operatives to sell nuclear material to foreign terrorist organizations that have an interest in targeting the United States. Next year the Department of Energy plans to allow the transporting by truck of highly enriched uranium from Canada to South Carolina. As a costsaving measure. the planned shipment would be in liquid form. These trucks are scheduled to enter the United States via the Peace Bridge in Buffalo. New York. An attack or an accident involving one of these trucks crossing the Peace Bridge could have devastating consequences. The Peace Bridge is the busiest passenger crossing on the northern border and the second busiest cargo port of entry. Closing the bridge for an extended period of time would cause great economic harm to the region and national economies. Further. an attack could contaminate the Great Lakes. which contain 84 percent of North Americas surface freshwater. with highly radioactive material. Despite these risks. the Department of Energy approved this route. relying on an analysis of this route that is 20 years old. and did not anticipate carrying such highlevel waste. In other words. the Federal Government is about to begin importing highly radioactive material. which has never been shipped in this manner. using outdated. pre9/11 information that does not reflect the threats we face today. To ensure that all relevant Federal agencies. including the Department of Energy. have the information they need to make decisions and develop policies that are informed by the terrorism threat picture. my bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security to share its assessment with Federal partners. Mr. Speaker. I urge Members to support H.R. 3350. a measure that will not only help ensure the Department of Energy has the information it needs with respect to transporting dangerous material through highrisk areas throughout the United States. but that other Federal agencies who are faced with similar questions are able to make better informed decisions. Many of the routes used for the transport of CBRN materials were approved nearly 20 years ago and. as such. reflect a pre9/11 mindset with respect to the threat and consequences of terrorism. My bill will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security assesses and shares threat information with the Department of Energy and other Federal agencies to ensure that they have the information needed to reach complicated decisions about transporting dangerous nuclear material throughout our communities. Enactment of my legislation will send a message to citizens at risk in Buffalo and beyond that we care about keeping them secure and ensuring that Federal policy is informed by the best information we have on terrorism threats. With that. I ask for my colleagues support. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140056218,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 3572. the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Reform and Improvement Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker. the Department of Homeland Security was established in 2003. when 22 agencies were folded together in what was the most substantial reorganization of Federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947. Since that time. the Department of Homeland Security has faced an everevolving range of threats and has taken on more missions and responsibilities. most notably with respect to cybersecurity. Even as the Department of Homeland Security has risen to the operational demands of the post9/11 world. departmental integration and coordination of key activitiessuch as policy development. acquisitions. and human capital managementhave been a challenge. As a result. the comptroller general and the Department of Homeland Security inspector general have repeatedly found instances where decisionmaking at the component level has resulted in performance failures that have wasted limited Department of Homeland Security resources. H.R. 3572 is designed to drive improvements at all levels of the Department and to codify key departmental management directives that were issued in recent years. Specifically. H.R. 3572 would strengthen the under secretary for management. authorize and realign central offices within the Management Directorate. bolster the Office of Policy. including its management of DHS overseas personnel. and address the Departments employee morale issues. Importantly. H.R. 3572 codifies the Departments acquisition policies. promoting management practices designed to deliver needed capabilities while actively managing risk. This bipartisan measure was introduced by Chairman MCCAUL on September 18. and Ranking Member THOMPSON was his original cosponsor. The degree to which this bill is a bipartisan product was further underscored by the acceptance of 13 amendments offered by Democratic members at the full committee markup held on Mr. Speaker. H.R. 3572 is in line with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnsons Unity of Effort initiative. For example. it streamlines how the Department conducts outreach with Homeland Security stakeholders. including businesses and local government agencies. and integrates that process with the Departments policymaking. Additionally. in an effort to address chronic morale issues and build bridges between Department of Homeland Security components. H.R. 3572 directs the Department to establish a rotational program for its workforce. Finally. the bill elevates the Assistant Secretary for Policy to an under secretary level. a move that successive DHS leaders have sought. By doing so. the bill seeks to not only improve departmentwide policymaking. but to also advance the goals of the initiative. With that. Mr. Speaker. I urge passage of H.R. 3572. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140096330,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR for their work on this bill. Mr. Chairman. my amendment would prohibit the shipment of dangerous. highly radioactive liquid nuclear waste. which the Department of Energy plans to begin shipping by truck later this year in a series of over 100 shipments from Ontario. Canada. to South Carolina. The department wants to transport this liquid waste. which is far more radioactive than spent nuclear fuel. across the northern border at the Peace Bridge and through downtown Buffalo. In contrast to spent nuclear fuel in solid form. which has a history of being shipped by land. this would constitute the first ever shipment of liquid nuclear waste by truck in a transportation cask that was never certified for this purpose. Its liquid form. if spilled. could make containment nearly impossible. The route crosses the Great Lakes. across the busiest passenger crossing at the northern border. and through a highdensity metropolitan area. In the event of an attack or an accident. the consequences could be devastating. In spite of these concerns. the Department of Energy failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act by not commencing with a new Environmental Impact Statement. instead. relying on old. outdated infor mation. The evolving threat picture since 9/11 requires that the Department of Energy reassess the manner in which it ships such dangerous materials. Proceeding with the shipments would also ignore the will of the House. which unanimously passed legislation requiring the Department of Homeland Security perform a terrorism threat assessment regarding the transportation of chemical. biological. nuclear and radiological materials through the United States. To reiterate. my bill would only impact one type of nuclear waste shipment. and other shipments of spent nuclear fuel would not be affected. I urge support for my amendment. which would prohibit these shipments until the Department of Energy performs a full and thorough review process. Proceeding without doing so would seriously compromise public safety. Mr. Chairman. I urge support of my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR . The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York .
1140109128,Mr. Chairman. at the outset. I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this appropriations bill. While not perfect. the bill funds the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative at $300 million so that critically important work to clean up the Great Lakes can continue. My amendment would prohibit funds in this act from being used by States in violation of the Great Lakes Compact. an agreement among the eight Great Lakes States outlining how this precious and nonrenewable resource is to be managed. The compact prohibits water from being pumped to areas beyond the drainage basin. and sets strict criteria for any diversion request. To that end. a municipal government outside the basin recently had its application approved to divert up to 8.2 million gallons per day from Lake Michigan. most of which will be returned after being treated. This diversion request was only approved after conditions were met lowering the volume of water to be withdrawn as well as reducing the service territory it would be provided to. Going forward. it will be important to ensure that the approval of this request does not set a precedent that will threaten to deplete this resource by encouraging further diversion requests that do not uphold the strict water management standards outlined in the compact. As freshwater supplies in other parts of the country and the world dwindle. the desire to divert water by tanker or the construction of pipelines could become a greater threat to the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are a nonrenewable source. Less than 1 percent of the water is renewed annually through rainfall and snow melt. The onslaught of climate change will likely cause water levels to decline in the future. Irresponsibly diverting water from the basin could threaten the fragile ecosystem. putting fish and wildlife at risk by degrading water quality and damaging habitats. This amendment is supported by the Alliance for the Great Lakes. the National Wildlife Foundation. and Citizens Campaign for the Environment. [From Citizens Campaign for the Environment]

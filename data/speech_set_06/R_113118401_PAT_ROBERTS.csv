1130001794,"Mr. President. I am rising to submit a resolution making it absolutely clear that Congress. and only Congress. has the authority and responsibility to set the Federal debt limit. I should not even have to submit a resolution such as this. but I feel it is absolutely necessary. Raising the Federal debt limitthe limit we place on government borrowingas everybody knows. has been a hot topic around Washington. It is a key issue for the start of the 113th Congress. It is another case where if we could just maintain regular order. regular authority to address our problems. that is the best way for us to approach the task of getting our fiscal house in order. I know there is a lot of dispute over what breaching the limit means. There is a lot of talk about that. It is clear a great deal of the public and our financial markets are extremely concerned about the Federal Governments ability to meet its financial obligations once we do hit the limit. The President has asked for a very large increase in the debt ceiling. and some in the administration have called for no limit at all. Others of the administration and in the House are calling for Congress to give up its authority to set the debt limitrather amazingthus giving the executive branch unilateral authority to borrow. This is not a good idea. If the Federal Government does not collect enough revenue to pay for all its spending obligations. it must borrow to make up the shortfall. Everybody knows that. We are borrowing now about 42 cents of every $1 we are obligated to spend. This is clearlyI think everybody would agree on either side of the aisle and the publican unsustainable situation which will only get worse if we do not begin meaningful discussions over our spending priorities. includingincludingentitlement spending to strengthen and preserve those programs for future generations. The national debt is growing. Everybody has seen that chart. It is about $16.4 trillion. The total public debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter just passed was $16.07 trillion. That is up from $15.86 trillion reported in June 2012. We are on the wrong path. The Federal debt is now equivalent to at least 73 percent of the Nations gross domestic productnearly double the level as a percentage of GDP that we had back in 1990. That is not too long ago. According to some measures. there has been a 60percent increase in the debt limit since 2009. At the rate we are going. in a few short years we will be spending more to pay interest on the debt than we will on all discretionary programs outside of defense. Even defense now is going through a very difficult time with the sequester and has already been cut about onehalf trillion dollars. Let me just say that means no money for education. That means no money for agriculture. That means no money for the environment. That means no money for health care. It all goes to pay off interest on the debt. The Federal debt is the accumulation of this borrowing. including all bills. notes. and bonds issued by the Department of the Treasury. The current statutory debt limit is $16.394 trillion. which was established on January 28 of last year. 2012about 1 year agounder the procedures of the Budget Control Act of 2011. According to the Department of the Treasury. as of December 31just last monthtotal debt outstanding subject to the limit was only $25 millionmillion. it used to be a lot of moneybelow the current limit. Once the amount of outstanding debt reaches the debt limit. the government can no longer issue additional debt to cover the cash shortfalls needed to fund government operations and meet legal obligations. Similar to the power of the purse. Congresss powers over borrowing are firmly rooted in our constitutional traditions. The Founders understood the potential danger of permitting the executive branch to unilaterally incur new public debt. Article I of the Constitution empowers onlyonlyCongress ""to borrow money on the credit of the United States."" The debt limit is the means by which CongressCongressexercises this critical legislative responsibility. I can remember well that lesson. that lecture. if you will. from Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. the institutional flame of the Senate. who would have repeated that Congress cannot give debt limit authority to the executive. should not. cannot. It is not constitutional. To implement this congressional prerogative. the amount of money the Federal Government is allowed to borrow is subject to a specific statutory limit. From time to time. Congress considers and adopts legislation to change this limit and has done so more than 100 times since the first modern debt limit was set way back in 1939. and we will do so again shortly. We have to. So preserving this role and establishing the debt limit is vital to encourage deficit reduction and to uphold our constitutional tradition of legislative control over borrowing. Not only does the debt limit provide an essential check on executive borrowing. it provides public accountabilityeverybody is talking about transparencyfor Congresss borrowing and debt management practices. We cannot duck that responsibility. We cannot pass this debt limit simply to the Executive and duck our responsibility and the public accountability. In other words. debates over the debt limit. as difficult and as contentious as they areand they are. I know thatshed the light of day on the overall financial condition of the Federal Government. Precluding these discussions by removing Congresss authority over the debt limit would lead to a less wellinformed decisionmaking over fiscal policy. That is probably the understatement of my remarks. It is a nice way to put it. We can do this. In the past. legislation to raise the debt limit has frequently been coupled with legislation to reduce the overall Federal debt and deficit. That is the way we should do it. These extensions. often approved on a bipartisan basis. have been important catalysts for fiscal reform. In this respect. the debt limit is a strong mechanism. a strong tool. a way for Congress to evaluate fiscal policy and to maintain control over such policy. Abdicating this role would fundamentally alter the checks and balances embedded in the Constitution. This is a power that should not be bargained away. The necessary and critical battle to control spending is far from over. I view the debt ceiling debate as a critical means in what has to be an ongoing effort to tighten the governments fiscal beltif we can just do that. But we cannot settle our national finances by fundamentally altering the constitutional structure and processes governing those finances. We cannot cavalierly give up one of our most important tools in evaluating and reining in the Federal Governments runaway spending. Equally clear. we cannot keep spending what we do not have. We must continue to fight for spending cuts. for debt reduction. and against tax increases and. I might add. the tidal wave of regulations that continue to pour out of Washington. In response to calls to give up this vital congressional authority over debt issuance. I am submitting today a simple resolution. Lets put the Senate on record. The Congress holds the sole authority to borrow money on the credit of the United States and cannot cede this power to the President. I invite everybody to cosponsor this important measure and look forward to passage of this resolution. This should be a bipartisan effort. and it is absolutely necessary."
1130011468,"Mr. President. I thank my distinguished colleague. the ranking member of the Budget Committee. the fully declared champion of fiscal responsibility. defender of hardpressed taxpayers all across the country. doing a splendid job here as a Senator who actually asked to be on the Budget Committee to try to meet these challenges. and I credit him for his leadership and example. I rise today to speak on my Democratic colleagues proposed budget resolution upon which they have just been waxing poetic before the Senate. I have mixed feelings about this budget. I have mixed feelings even being here on the Senate floor in that I am bereft of charts. What on Earth am I going to do making comments about this budget without the appropriate charts? Everybody has charts. Look at these stands around here. My colleagues across the aislewho have now left the Chamber since I began speakinghave displayed charts. I wonder if the Parliamentarian could inform this speaker if we could turn off the lights and I have a PowerPoint and a laser pointer? I will not ask that. But I dont have a chart. I just have some remarks that I would like to put together about the challenge we all face. I am pleased. everybody is pleased. finally. that the Senate has again. finally. taken up its constitutional responsibility to consider a budget in regular orderor at least some framework of regular order. However. I have the temerity to suggest that after 4 years. this budget resolution does not cut the spending muster and. from a constitutional responsibility. I fear it has indeed been very irresponsible. At the same time. I look at this budget and I ask: Is this all we waited for these past 4 years? In the words of the famous song. ""Is That All There Is?"" Or better put. is this more than all there is? And it certainly is more. There is an old saying that if you want to be remembered by your children. leave a lot of debt. Well. if this budget is passed and it sticks. then there are going to be a whole lot of people who vote yes who will certainly be remembered. The solution was. indeed. to return to regular order. return to the regular process: Examine the Presidents budget. pass a budget resolution. and provide clear directives to the authorizing and appropriations committees to develop legislation to reflect the tough decisions made in the budget. A lot of words. None of it is very easy. but that is called regular order. That is what we should have been doing the last 4 years. We have not been doing that. We havent been doing that at all. Everybody knows the process around here. What happens is we have a major bill to do. we have our obligations to do. we have our constitutional responsibilities to do. We try that. We ask for amendments. we dont get amendments. We file cloture. they dont get 60 votes. and the bill fails. Or we have a continuing resolution. some giant body of legislation that is the worst way to do businessor a sequester. the same kind of thing. And people back home scratch their heads. People on that side of the aisle perhaps have an issuenot a bill. but they might have an issue. Then the blame game starts. I think the American people are tired of it. None of it is easy. I understand that. But it works much better. much better than lurching from crisis to crisis as we have done and experienced in the last 4 years. So I am pleased that we are slowly returning to some aspects of regular order. but I remain deeply concerned about the daunting fiscal challenges we face and the fact that we are not answering these challenges. The Federal balance sheet is now truly frightening. Today. almost 1.500 days since we last considered a budget resolution on this Senate floor. we are fast approaching $17 trillion in debtand beyond. It is climbing. Our perperson share of that debt is now more than $53.000. This is why I am so frustrated. and many of our colleagues are frustrated and disappointed by the budget resolution we are about to consider. Yes. again. we have brought this resolution through regular order. I appreciate that. But the recommendations fail. They fail to begin to meaningfully address the key fiscal issues that we are all generally agreed are sustainable. I dont have a chart. but I think people can understand this. The numbers are startling. Since 2009 we have added nearly $6 trillion to the national debt. Under the proposed budget resolution. despite a massive new tax hike proposal. new debt will risesince I dont have a chart. just sort of imagine it here-$7 trillion over 10 years. I hasten to add. that is on a projection by the Congressional Budget Office. and I think it is probably low. Spending will increase another $645 billion above the projected growth over 10 years. including $162 billion in the next year alone. The deficit will increase in the next fiscal year by $95 billion above current forecasts. I could have a chart with a big zero on it. It is not a soft drink. This is something pretty serious. Zero. That is right. zerozero real deficit reduction through spending reductions. It would never and doesnt pretend to try to balance the budgetprecisely what the Senator from Alabama has been pointing out. In my view. this resolution would further damage our fiscal condition over the long haul. exactly what we dont want to do. We do not want to kick the can down the road any further. We cant do it. We have reached that point of no return. And here is the kicker for me. The budget resolution includes a proposed $1.5 trillion in new taxes. That is on top of the $600 billion tax hike that was just enacted in January. This would include a $923 billion reconciliation instruction to the Finance Committee. I am a member of that very prestigious committee. I look forward to trying to achieve tax reform. but I worry about a $923 billion reconciliation despite the negative impact this would have on critically needed progrowth tax reform. The budget also includes about $500 billion in unspecified loophole closers to increase spending on infrastructure and to replace the current sequester. Loopholes. Loophole closures. Boy. is that in the eyes of the beholder. I am concerned about it. No doubt the Gatling gun kind of criticisms we heard in the past campaign. singling out tax reform targetsand I always want to add. you always want to worry about what lurks under the banner of reform of whatever banner someone is waving. Time after time I heard the President talk about fat cat corporate jets. Boy. am I tired of hearing about that. That is business aviation. That is 1 million jobs. That is a great number of aircraft that is adding to our exports. The President has said: Lets double our exports. and still we hear this pejorative of fat cat corporate jets. Also. oil and gas subsidies. two major industries of Kansas. even those are critical. successful industries with all the hallmarks we should want in an industrygood. hightech paying jobs. Sure I am for tax reform. and sure I want to reach the specified numbers that we could all agree onif we could all agree on a specified number. But policy counts. and you dont want to do anything terribly counterproductive. The call for a gigantic tax hike to pay for more spending is misguided and will harm our chances for tax reform. It will do little to place our budget on any sustainable path. Not only that. this budget is a job killer. The Tax Foundation analysis I just read today indicates the legislation in its current form will result in the loss of 800.000 jobs over 10 years. It is a job killer. Why on Earth would we be considering a budget resolution that will result in the loss of 800.000 jobs? In Kansas. that hit would be about 10.000 jobs. That is low. I have no doubt this number understates that problem. We all know the time is long past for us to reform our overly complex. costly. anticompetitive tax system. That is a given. We know that. I might add that the Finance Committee. under the chairmanship of MAX BAUCUS and the ranking members leadership. ORRIN HATCHall of us on the Finance Committee have been meeting as Republicans and Democrats together. We can do this job. Give us 6 months to do it right. Give us a flashing light at the end of the room saying ""Do No Harm."" and we can get this done. The current system is a drain on individual and business resources. It is one of the main causes of our sluggish economic growth. We need to put in place a Tax Code for the 21st century. one that recognizes the nature of the international trade system in which we competeand there is competitionand one that recognizes the changes to our domestic business environment. We also need to lower corporate rates so the United States no longer has the highest rate in the developed world. It is critical that Congress encourage economic growth and private sector job creation by putting in place a tax system that is simpler and fairer to all taxpayers. a tax system that doesnt change every year or two. one that provides certainty. We need to provide certainty by establishing a permanent Tax Code that will allow families to plan for their future and give businesses the confidence to expand and create jobs. Adopting a fair and simple tax system that lowers marginal rates. encourages economic growth. promotes our competitiveness. and eases complianceread regulatory reform. read a Katrina of regulations that now affects virtually every business endeavor in the country. read all thatthat is the most powerful step we can take to improve our economy. While I support considering a budget through regular orderthank goodness we are finally achieving thatwe are presented with a profoundly disappointing document. a budget that includes a massive jobkilling tax increase. increases spending. raises the deficit and debt. and all but kills prospects for tax reformjust what the doctor did not order. After 4 years of deliberate inaction. my colleagues and I had hoped for better. I yield the floor."
1130024306,Mr. President. I rise today in advocacy for each of my colleagues to come to the floor this afternoon and vote in support of Senate Resolution 65. This vital resolution makes a clear statement to Iranboth to the current regime and to Iranian citizens who wish for real and true change from the status quothat the United States will not tolerate its development of a nuclear weapon. Additionally. Senate Resolution 65 expresses the United States unconditional support for Israels right to selfdefense against the threat of a nuclear Iran. These vital statements come at a time when change could happen with Irans elections next month. But unfortunately. there is little reason to believe things will change. According to the State Department. Iran remains the most active state sponsor of terrorism. This is a statistic that must be addressed. Irans continual material and financial support to Hezbollah and Hamas. expanding involvement in Syria. and serial deception of its nuclear program are unlikely to be different a month from now. a year from now. perhaps. a decade from now. Especially as Iran continues to reject the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agencys. IAEA. regulatory authority and oversight. the United States must reiterate the plain and simple fact that a nuclear Iran is unacceptable. When looking at the bigger picture. the recent terrorist attacks and killings in Boston and Benghazi remind all Americans that our war on terrorism continues. Even as troop numbers dwindle in Afghanistan. this fight and its core focus are far from over. We must continue to combat the terrorist threat around the world and strengthen our allied relationships as this fight continues. Irans funneling of weapons and aid to terrorist cells increases their threat beyond the neighborhood. Iran is not only a threat to Israel but to the United States as well. Senate Resolution 65 reminds us of this fact and of the long and important strategic relationship our nations have shared. one which has been built of mutual trust and strengthened through security cooperation. I strongly support the United States determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I strongly support this resolution as it makes our determination unequivocal. All options are on the table. To avoid our option of last resort. armed conflict. it is important that this Congress continue to push for full implementation of sanctions against the current regime in Iran to cripple their ability to acquire a nuclear weapon. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in advocating for thisnot only this administration. but for the European Union and democracies around the world to strengthen their sanctions on this rogue regime. as Irans beliefs. rhetoric. and actions threaten every nation who calls for democracy and freedom. Of greatest importance. this resolution makes it crystal clear that the United States stands firmly behind Israel and her right to selfdefense by pledging full support should Israel take military action against the threat of Irans nuclear program. This is not an authorization for use of military force or a declaration of war. However. it sends the right message to Iran and the rest of the world. The United States stands strong behind our allies. Even in this time of necessary financial restraint. the United States will never leave an ally to fight alone.
1130054481,Thank you. Madam President. I will try to wrap up. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator who wishes to speak. I will try to get this done. We were meeting with the President. I was bringing up the issue of regulations. but the rest of the people were talking about a grand bargain and what could happen. The President said on tax reform: Why cant we start with a clean page? Basically everybody agreed. And then he said we could also take mortgage interest. charitable giving. retirement. and we can meanstest those and start from there. I thought. oh boy. here we go againincome redistribution. That is not the answer. I would just say that before we enter into any negotiations. we ought to make sure that the Budget Control Act and the fiscal cliff bill. which were negotiated in good faith with the Vice President and which have resulted in lower spending. in the first actual decreases in spending by the Federal Government since the Korean War. That is unbelievable. So in going to negotiate. I dont want to give up in regards to those decreases. and I dont want a situation where the President has said: I gave to you on CPI so I need $800 billion in revenue. The distinguished majority leader has said it is $1 trillion. So if we are going to raise $1 trillion in revenue. then here we go again and whatever negotiations come down the pike are going to be more spending and more taxes. People are just figuring out what their tax bill is going to be with ObamaCare. We dont need a situation where we sit down and negotiate simply for more taxes and spending. Without going into the constitutional implications of granting any authority on autopilot to the President. I would say I am adamantly opposed to giving any President that much control over the budget. Why does all of this matter? Why am I making this speech? Why is my friend across the aisle going to make her speech? The debt limit is currently $16.7 trillion. The debt has increased about $6 trillion since the President took officemore than any other President in our history. The main source of this tremendous growth in our debt is entitlement spending. Social Security. Medicare. Medicaid. PAUL RYAN has a plan to fix that. It ought to at least be on the table. and that way we can see a path for where we can go with it. Without changes. spending on these programs is expected to grow by 79 percent over the next 10 years. In fact. by law. there is no upper limit on how much we spend on these programs. This spendingadded to interest payments on the debtwill make up close to 65 percent of the budget in 10 years. By then we wont have any discretionary spending. The Congressional Budget Office reports that we remain on an unsustainable path. All we are askingprudently. I hopeis that any increase in the Federal debt limit needs to be coupled with real. tangible cuts in discretionary spending and meaningful. structural reform to entitlement spending. We need to get this done to rein in our unsustainable debt and to ensure that these programs are there for our children and our grandchildren. Madam President. I ask unanimous consent that an article by Thomas Sowell. a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution from Stanford University be printed in the RECORD at this time.
1130061283,Mr. President. I come to the floor today to speak in support of the Drug Quality and Security Act. H.R. 3204. Getting this bill to where it is todayand I thank the leader for just making that possible. along with our minority leaderhas been a long and sometimes very difficult road. one on which I have been working for over a decadeyes. 10 years. This is an issue that hit far too close to home in Kansas. Several years ago. a pharmacist in Kansas City. Robert Courtney. was found to be diluting cancer drugs for his patients. Unfortunately. over 4.000 patients were affected before authorities could stop him. Senator Kit Bond at that time and myself worked together to hold the first Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on pharmacy compounding. Since that time I have continued my interest in the compoundingrelated issues. Unfortunately. last September. over a year ago. the tragic meningitis outbreak began. This outbreak was the result of contaminated compounded medications produced by the New England Compounding Center. Of the 751 people who became ill. 64 people lost their lives. Many of those who became ill are still suffering and have experienced painful relapses in their condition. Unfortunately. that is not the only occurrence in the last 10 years. Without proper safeguards and clear authority. I fear that these tragedies would only continue. We acknowledged then that we had to buckle down and really get something done. Since that time. I have been working with my colleagues to draft the pending legislation before this body. the Drug Quality and Security Act. with the desire to protect patients and improve regulation of the pharmacy compounding industry. I think that we have finally achieved what we all intended from the beginning. which is a bipartisan. bicameral product that is supported by a majority of the stakeholder groups and a variety of those groups. This legislation has the support of the pharmacists led by the National Community Pharmacists Association and the American Pharmacists Association. It has the support of the patient advocacy groups such as the Cancer Leadership Council and of industry groups such as the Pharmaceutical Distribution Security Alliance. In fact. this is quite a long list. I will not take the Senates time to go over that list. But I would ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the RECORD at this point in its entirety.
1130070889,"Mr. President. today I wish to stress the problems and impact the Presidents legacy program. the Affordable Care Actknown as ObamaCareis having on Kansans and. for that matter. patients and people all over the country. I know some of this has been repeated over and over. The problem is. it seems the administration continues to turn a blind eye. unfortunately. to some very egregious problems which plague the Presidents legacy program. Perhaps the title of my remarks should be ""Promises Made and Promises Not Kept."" When I travel home to Kansas and talk to people involved in the rural and urban health care delivery system. folks who came to the townhall meetings because they were worried and concerned about ObamaCare to begin with. that concern turned to frustration. then it turned to fear. and now it switched back into anger. They have said: What on Earth can we do to solve some of these problems and these challenges which are directly affecting people in such an egregious way? I think everybody now understands the rollout of the health care exchanges was a debacle. I think that is the favorite word of the people writing and providing news about this. But the point is the administration has failed to hold anyone at the Department of Health and Human Services accountable for the complete failure of the exchange. the waste of taxpayer dollars. and the confusion and headaches this has caused. I know the only one who has been held accountableor terminated. if you will. firedwas the current contractor and they have hired a new contractor. There is newswhich we would have to confirmthat the new contractor was recently fired by the National Health Service in Great Britain for being $2 billion over on the contract. That doesnt bode well if we are going to actually fix this Web site. At the time of the rollout. the refrain was that ObamaCare is certainly more than a Web site. Similar to NANCY PELOSIS words prior to passage. we were all told: Just wait and see. That is still what the refrain is. with the presumption that things are going to work out. it will just take time. for the American people. Unfortunately. what I and many of my colleagues have said is coming true and a lot of people back in Kansas have told me is coming true in what they are going through. and it is the polar opposite of what was promised by this President. Again. promises made. promises not kept. Estimates are that over 5 million people have received cancellation of their health care policies and that is just in the 35 States for which we have estimates. So much for the promise. ""if you like your plan. you can keep it."" which has been highly publicized. The President proposed a socalled fix to this problem. which caused insurance companies to scramble to delay things until after the midterm election. and the only person in America for whom this was convenient was the President. It is still not working. What about the promise of less cost? A specific promise made by the President. of those people forced into the exchanges we continue to get reportsfirsthand reports. I know. to everybody in the Senate and the House as wellreports that have received a lot of coverage with regard to the news media that the premiums are going up. not down. as promised by the President. There are reports of ObamaCare more than doubling peoples costs and increasing deductibles by sevenfold. I am not sure that is the average. but that at least is a high one with regard to some of the reports that are still coming in. obviously becoming then more than people can afford. It is no surprise that only 2.2 million have signed up. and 2 to 1 on that goes to Medicaid as opposed to the new program. so one can see where we are headed with regard to Medicaid and some of the challenges there. That is according to the recent estimates of the Department of Health and Human Services. That is far below what was expected. Of those enrollees. only onequarter of them are young and healthy individuals. and that is a problem. Without younger and healthier people in the exchanges to offset costs. we can only expect premiums to rise even higher. Once people are enrolled that is not the end of their problems. however. Some folks in Kansas are reporting that when they go to the doctor. they only then discover they do not have the insurance they thought they purchased. Some have had to cancel planned appointments with their doctors because their exchange coverage was not in order or could not be confirmed. In some of the worst cases. patients in the emergency room were forced between getting care they desperately needed or leaving to avoid high costs when their coverage could not be verified. That is exactly opposite of what the President promisedagain. promises made and promises not kept. Emergency rooms will face more problems in the future. Recent studies have shown that instead of reducing emergency room utilization as the President promised. which has been identified as a crowning achievement. people with coverage are actually accessing the emergency room more than their uninsured counterparts. Some weeks ago I spoke about one of my favorite topics. in that as a member of the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee. the amendments that I had dealt with rationing and the worry of rationing with regard to the Affordable Health Care Act or at that time what was called PPACA. now referred to as ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. depending on which side you are on. These rationing boards represent some of the more frightening aspects of the law. I have always referred to them as the four rationers. I think a colleague of mine. who is an expert on health care. actually said they are the ""Four Horsemen of the ObamaCare Apocalypse."" Let me go down these four rationers. It gets involved. but patients and people worried about their health care coverage have every reason to worry about them. First is the CMS Innovation Center. We know what that stands for. the CMS Innovation Center. That allows CMS to use taxpayer dollars to invest in ways to reduce patient access to care that they may want. What this means for patients is the CMS has a new and expanded power over and above what they are already doing to cut payments to Medicare beneficiaries. with the goal to reduce program expenditures but the reality being they will reduce patient access to health care. to their doctor. Second. rationing. The new authorities granted to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Forcethat is a mouthful. USPSTFI dont know how on Earth one would pronounce that acronym. but it is the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. These folks are to determine what should and should not be covered by health insurance. It is some unelected group of bureaucrats deciding what should and should not be covered by health insurance. What this means for patients is that if the USPSTF. the mouthful acronym doesnt recommend it. then it will not be covered by your health care plan and you will bear the cost of the procedure. Here is the third rationing. The PatientCentered Outcomes Research Institute. that is the PCORI. if you are discussing health care policy with CMS or the Department of Health and Human Services. does comparative effective researchcomparative. effective research. CER. To me. that is a slippery slopethat I tried to amend back during consideration within the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee. unsuccessfully on a partyline votethat will lead to the government deciding whether the care or a treatment a patient wants is worth paying for. What this means for patients is that research could be abused to arbitrarily deny patients access to treatments orand treatments by age or by gender or by raceservices to save the government money. If that was not enough. finally. the fourth horseman. there is everyones nemesis. IPAB. the Independent Payment Advisory Board. We dont want to saddle up on this horse. This is a board made up of 15 unelected bureaucrats who will decide what gets to stay. what gets to go into Medicare coverage. We used to do that in this body and over in the House. It was alleged during debate that we could not make those decisions because we were too close to the people involved. What is that all about? Isnt that what we are supposed to be doing in terms of representing the folks we represent? No. it has to go to this 15member unelected board that will decide what gets to stay and what gets to go in Medicare coverage. They will decide what treatments and services will be covered and which will not. The primary reason is to save money. Goodness knows we are all for saving money in the health care systemor saving money period. given our national debt and all that involves. This Board has no accountability. There is no confirmation process. they are appointed. There is no real transparency and we cannot do anything about it. I think the provision of the bill is we can say. wait a minute. they made the wrong decision on Medicare payments to hospitals or to any part of our health care delivery system. that we could by a supermajority. 67 votes. maybe change it. maybe not. I have been talking about the four rationers for a long time and what it means to patients. I will continue to talk about that. I will come to the floor after next week and see if we cant put this together in a little bit better way so people are alert to what is going on and people are alert to what dangers lurk for them in regard to the availability of their doctor and their current way of treating themselves and their family. What is scary about this. as I watched all the other warnings and broken promises come true. is what is going to happen to Kansas constituents and those across the country when these new warnings about ObamaCare continue to come true. The bottom line? We need to protect. we truly need to protect the allimportant relationship between the doctor and the patient. which now is at risk. In order to do that. it seems to me that small fixes are not going to do this. We need to repeal and. most importantly. replace ObamaCare with real reforms that work. not only for Kansans but everybody across the country. The whole program needs to be repealed. replaced. defunded. delayed. not just the parts that are politically convenient for the President or the parts that have yet to be decided by the President as the Lizzy Borden ax falls in regard to those decisions. I know Kansans and the American people certainly deserve better. I am going to talk and talk about the four rationers again in more detail. This only serves as a warning and an alert about promises made. promises not kept. but people have to understand who these four rationers are. what they intended to do. and what the dangers are and why amendments to prevent rationing were not successful in the beginning when this bill was passed. I yield the floor and it appears to me we do not have a quorum."
1130072155,"Mr. President. I rise today to discuss the Agriculture Act of 2014. That is the new name of the farm bill. After over 3 years of hard work by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees and other interested Members. we are finally nearing the finish line for this version of the Nations farm and food policy. As all Kansans and all farmers and ranchers from every State know. the farm bill impacts not only our farmers and ranchers but also businesses up and down Main Street. as well as families in our rural towns and urban cities. Everyone in Kansas. people who work in agriculture or are impacted by its successwhich. by the way. is every single Americanand my colleagues in the Congress deserve to know why I was the only Senator on the conference committee not to sign the conference report as of last night. I am here today to fully explain my reasoning and why I cannot and will not vote for this legislation. It all comes down to this simple question: Does the new farm bill improve agriculture in America? I believe the answer is. unfortunately. no. While we all want to provide longoverdue certainty to producerssomething lacking for over 400 days. for 2 years. a recordthe conference missed an opportunity for greater and necessary reforms to our Nations farm programs. Federal nutrition programs. and burdensome regulations. We should not march backward and pass a farm bill with more government subsidies. more regulations. and more waste. How on Earth did we get to this point today? Back in 2011 Chairperson STABENOW and I started the process of writing a new farm bill with a field hearing in her home State of Michigan. Later that year we held another successful hearing in Wichita. KS. After more formal hearings in the Senate and conversations with Kansas producers. Michigan producers. producers all over this country. it was clear to me that this farm bill would have to be reformoriented. reduce the deficit. and be responsiblenot only to farmers and ranchers but also to consumers and taxpayers. Unfortunately. as I stand here today. this farm bill does not meet those standards. and. taken as a whole. the conference report fails to move both Federal farm and food programs forward. I previously voted against the Senate bill. which looked too much in the rearview mirror for outdated programs. but this report is even worse. Just listen to this: Last years House bill was officially called the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act-""reform."" ""risk management""and here in the Senate we passed the Agriculture Reform. Food. and Jobs Act. The final report now is reduced to the Agriculture Act. the farm bill. Today I will focus my comments on my three biggest concerns: commodity subsidy programs. nutrition program spending. and the lack of regulatory reforms so sorely needed. Considering we all commonly refer to the legislation as the farm bill. my first concern and criticism is the new price loss coverage program. The acronym for that is PLC. It is a subsidy program. Back in 2012. 2 years ago. I was pleased that the Senate Agriculture Committee and the full Senate passed a bipartisan commodity title that contained real reform. We ended the current countercyclical commodity subsidy program and got the government out of the business of sending signals to producers essentially telling them which crops to plant by setting target price guarantees for producersfarming for the government. not farming for the market. Unfortunately. that reform was replaced in the latest Senate bill with a new target price subsidy program. doubled down in the House version with even higher target prices. and manipulated even more in the conference report to suit the desire of specific crops over the objections of others in different regions. The new Price Loss Coverage Program repeats a classic government subsidy mistake: setting high fixed target prices or subsidies. which only guarantees overproduction. with long periods of low crop prices. leading to more expensive farm programs funded directly by taxpayers. Why do we have to go down that road again? I have yet to hear one legitimate explanation for why Congress is about to tell all producers across this country that the Federal Government will guarantee the price of your wheat at $5.50 per bushelby the way. it is a little over $6 right now at the country elevator in Dodge Cityand rice at $14 per hundredweight for the next 5 years regardless of what happens in the market. We have done this before. and we know it creates planting and marketing distortions instead of letting our producers respond to market conditions. After the World Trade Organizationthe WTOruled against the United States for our cotton programs. I thought we had learned a lesson. I have said it before and will say it again: The WTO stove is hot. Why would we reach out and touch it again? Remember that we are still required to pay Brazil millions of dollars a year under that decision. The Amber Box subsidy programs in this bill will open American agriculture to global trade disputeswhich we have already lost and will likely lose again if challenged. To date. objections and solutions from me and my colleaguesranging from South Dakota. Senator THUNE. Nebraska. Senator JOHANNS. Iowa. Senator GRASSLEY. and even Ohio. Representative BOr GIrnShave all fallen on deaf and stubborn ears. Our efforts to add market orientation to the price loss coverage subsidy program. as well as attempts to end it outright. have all been blocked and are certainly not reflected in the final report. I am equally unhappy with the final outcome of the nutrition title of the farm bill. Partisan politics has unnecessarily infiltrated this debate. with many Members on the other side of the aisle drawing a line in the sand at zero savings or real reform to the expensive and unrestricted Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. That is called SNAP. It is really the food stamp program. Facts are stubborn things. Despite good intentions. SNAPfood stampsnow makes up more than 80 percent of the Department of Agricultures budget and was previously exempted from acrosstheboard sequestration cuts. What we have here today is a ballooning and expensive set of Federal nutrition programs. with a patchwork of eligibility standards. loopholes. and. frankly. unneeded bonuses to State governments for simply administering the program. If you administer the program right. you get a bonus. I understand and sympathize with the need for nutrition assistance for hardworking families. I have championed their efforts. However. we cannot and simply should not box off SNAP from unnecessary and timely reforms. While the Senate version of the bill in 2012 and 2013 did tighten the Low Income Home Energy Assistance ProgramLIHEAPloophole to save roughly $4 billion over 10 years. there have always been additional needed reforms to the program. At the end of the 2012 Senate bill. I included my personal views in the report. I identified eight additional ways to rein in the outofcontrol spending and reinstitute program integrity for the SNAP program. Last year. in 2013. I introduced a standalone piece of legislation that would have saved a total of $36 billion in SNAP without ever touching individual monthly benefits. and it failed on a partyline vote. Eventually. the House of Representatives passed nearly $40 billion in savingsafter intense debate over therewithin the SNAP program. That is a 5percent reduction over a 10year period. I do not see how the final legislation. amounting to a 1percent reduction in SNAP spending. is a fair compromise between both versions of the legislation. This just does not add up. In every single one of my townhall meetings in Kansasand I know the Presiding Officer from West Virginia finds the same thing true in his home Statethe first question fedup producers and business owners ask is. How can we stop or even slow down the onslaughtthe onslaughtof regulations? This farm bill had great potential to help producers and ranchers and all of agriculture with reducing the crushing regulatory burden from the governments rules and requirements. They just want relief. Despite years of work in both committees and strong provisions in the Housepassed farm bill. the final legislation lacks key. commonsense. and sound science regulatory reforms. I am more than disappointed that a WTOcompliant resolution to mandatory countryoforigin labelingit is called COOLwas not reached. As a result. our livestock producers who were already facing drought and high feed prices. now are going to have to worry about retaliatory actions by the Governments of Canada and Mexico. Our ranchers are equally troubled that provisions in the House bill directing the USDA to refocus their efforts on the Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Act. the acronym for that is GIPSA. they were excluded. Another regulatory relief provision was already cleared by the full House and the Senate ag committee would have ended the duplicative National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. I will not try the acronym for that. These are pesticide permits required by the Environmental Protection Agency. We had an opportunity to protect human health and eliminate duplicative. unnecessary regulatory actions. and instead. despite all of our commitments to work together to resolve the issue. we were all blocked from including the simple and necessary regulatory relief. Each of these regulatory reforms had bipartisan support. But now producers across the country are left without an explanation and. much worse. no needed relief. I am shocked at how far some Members will go to protect this administrations regulatory agenda instead of protecting real hardworking Americans. After all of that. let me point out that with any large piece of legislation one can usually find some positives to point to and todays farm bill is no different. While I support many of the programs in the less talked about titles of the farm bill. I am especially appreciative of the inclusion of strong crop insurance provisions and livestock disaster programs. The No. 1 issue we heard over and over again from our producers across the country and in every corner of Kansas was that crop insurance was their No. 1 one priority for the farm bill. secondly. they said get the regulations off our backs. The policies in the final bill protect the commitment to producers by strengthening crop insurance as the cornerstone of our farm safety net. regardless of the size of their farm or the commodity they grow. As this bill moves forward. the Risk Management Agency. RMA. will be busy offering expanded coverage for commodities such as cotton that have not traditionally participated in the program as much as other crops. However. I am concerned that the conservation compliance requirement included in the legislation on crop insurance. not on cropping operations. not on being a farmer but on crop insurance. will unnecessarily burden producers who are already good stewards of their land and already subjected to conservation requirements in the commodity programs. This is a duplicationmore paperwork. As the western half of Kansas continues to linger in a historic drought. the lack of livestock disaster programs that expired in 2011 is truly upsetting. We should have never let the programs expire in the first place. We had an opportunity in 2012 to reauthorize them. but the Senate failed to act. over my calls of action. All of the livestock disaster programs are finally retroactively authorized. But the assistance will be too little and too late in many parts of cattle country. Some have lost part of their herds and even strains of cattle genetics. Unfortunately. as a Kansan. as well as a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the farm bill conference committee. I am disappointed to say that the final policies of this farm bill do not outweigh the positives. While we all want to provide certainty to producers. the conference has missed an opportunity for greater and necessary reforms to our Nations farm programs. Federal nutrition programs. and burdensome regulations. After over 3 years of debate. the challenges that agriculture faces at home and across the world have only continued to grow. We need 21st century policies and innovative solutions. Instead. this bill misses the mark and goes backward to protectionist programs. The issues I raise deserve to be debated fully and publicly. I know time is of the essence. Yet the full conference committee met only once for opening statements last October. With all of the ramifications of the farm bill. we met once last Octoberfor 3 minutes apiece. In truth. the majority of this bill was negotiated behind closed doors without the opportunity for votes. amendments or discussion. There is too much of that around here. Producers. consumers. and our global trading partners expected more. Unfortunately. the U.S. taxpayers deserve better than this conference report. I did not sign this conference report last night and cannot in good conscience vote for this legislation. But I will promise this to all of the Members who worked so hard to at least get a bill. I will continue to work and advocate on behalf of advancing agriculture. I yield the floor."
1130096807,"Mr. President. I first congratulate my colleague Senator ISAKSON for doing a good job of summarizing exactly where we are and the problems we are experiencing with the complexity of the Affordable Care Act and the hope that the new Secretary will be responsive. as the Senator so eloquently pointed out when he questioned her when she came before the committee. I thank the Senator for making an excellent speech and making excellent points. and I will endeavor to do the same. as we are talking about the same subject. My remarks are once again on the Affordable Care Act. I know we have other issues. many important issuesthe Veterans Administration. the release of terrorists in an exchangebut it is equally important we continue to shed light on the many failings of this law. During the very first debate on the Affordable Care Act. I distinctly remember comparing this rush to government health care as akin to riding hellforleather into a box canyon to find the only alternative would be to turn around. ride back out. and get on a more realistic. marketoriented health reform trail. Then I put it another way. I said: There are a lot of cactuses out there. We didnt have to sit on every one of them. We never even saw the bill before we voted on it. I think everybody understands that. I voted no and so did every Republican Senator and Member of Congress. This was not a bipartisan effort. I regret to say to my colleagues that I told you so. and here we are in a box canyon. Until the administration provides us more details to the contrary. we have to assume that more Americans are losing the care they liked. through cancellation notices. than they have enrolled in the exchanges. They are in a box canyon. It is now estimated that ObamaCare will cost the Nation nearly $2 trillion and has created higher premiums. higher taxes. less choice. confusion. delays. and problem after problem. Unfortunately. the President and his allies in the Congress continue to protect this law. despite its toll on our economy. our patients. and our providers. The President promised. as we all remember: Well lower premiums for a typical family by $2.500 per year. Valerie from Wichita. KS. wrote me a letter to share her story on this broken promise. She writes: I wanted to let you know that I had to drop my company health insurance due to the Affordable Care Act. My premium before the Act was $250 a month and my employer paid $100 a month toward the premium. My insurance year expired April Ist and the new year is under the ACA health insurance. The new plan is now much higher at $565 a month and my employer can only afford to pitch in $150 a month. I had to drop my plan due to unaffordability. I could not pay the $415 a month. The President also promised. highly publicized: ""If you like your health care plan. youll be able to keep your health care plan. period."" and. ""If you like your doctor. youll be able to keep your doctor."" This law has significantly disrupted the individual health insurance market by imposing mandates and causing at least 5 million Americans to lose the insurance they had or have. Doug. also from Wichita. wrote to share his personal story on this one. He said: I am a small business owner who just got my familys health insurance cancelled. I have talked it through with [the insurance company] and at a minimum I will be paying 63% more per month for coverage that has a deductible 3 times greater than what I had and my doctor may or may not be in the network. Doug continues on to say: The only topic that matters in Washington is stopping the insanity of [ObamaCare]. Most important. the President promised. ""I will protect Medicare."" This law cuts over $700 billion from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. Part of those cuts come from the establishment. the establishment of an Independent Payment Advisory Boardwhat a wonderful acronym for this boardIPAB. This Board is supposed to be made up of 15 unelected bureaucrats who will decide which treatments in Medicare coverage should be taken away with regard to reimbursement. As I have stated on the Senate floor before. the IPAB has no accountability and their decisions are practically impossible to overturn. The administration continues to give us piecemeal data on exchange enrollments. delays provisions of the law that they cant implement on time or simply wants to delaya large serving of politics involvedand is providing exclusive waivers and special deals to unions and others from the yoke of ObamaCare. In fact. the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service confirmed that the administration has missed half of the mandated deadlines of this law. Most recently. press reports have indicated the government may be paying incorrect subsidies to more than 1 million Americans for their health care plans in the new Federal insurance exchanges. and they have so far been unable to fix the errors. Obviously. this poses a lot of problems for a lot of people. Unfortunately. the President and his allies in Congress continue to protect this law despite its toll on our economy. patients. and providers. A new Health and Human Services Secretary has been nominated. Sylvia Mathews Burwell. as Senator ISAKSON referred to. but with ObamaCare. nothing will alter. We are headed for socialized medicine. ObamaCare is the Presidents legacy. The President will unilaterally change what suits him best. The hardworking taxpayers who are paying for this law. in large part from the 21 tax increases contained in it. have a right to some answers. That is right. I said 21 tax increases. Just some of these taxes include the following: the individual mandate tax. where people have to pay the government for not having insurance. even if they cant afford it. the employer mandate tax. where an employer pays a tax because they may have chosen to forgo providing insurance to their employees instead of having to lay off workers. the health insurance tax. which will be passed along to individuals in the form of higher premiums. the medical device tax. I could go on and on. Many of these taxes have bipartisan support to be repealed. but we cant even get a vote on those. With a $1.8 trillion pricetag. this bill is so farreaching it is difficult to find a Federal agency that doesnt have a hand in this pot. from your doctors office to your wallet. to your privacy. That is why I am introducing today a bill to require a special inspector general for monitoring the Affordable Care Act. We call it the SIGMA Act. It is the Special Inspector General for Monitoring the Affordable Health Care Act. While all of the Federal agencies charged with implementing the Affordable Care Act have Offices of the Inspector Generaland they do. they are all investigating this law in their own silowhere have we heard that before with a lot of problems within the Federal Governmentthe Health and Human Services inspector general isnt talking to the Treasury IG or the Department of Labor IG or the Homeland Security IG or any one of those with each other. This bill would give appropriate authority to investigate and to audit any programs or activities related to this law across the many Federal departments. State exchanges. and private contractors. The legislation will require a report to be submitted to Congress and the American people 6 months after enactment and quarterly reports for the duration of time the Affordable Care Act is on the books. They have broad authority to review all aspects of the law. Things such as the following: Changes in the health insurance marketplace. the amount of folks who have seen their premiums and outofpocket costs increased. shrinking physician and other provider networks. We have a right to know that. The employer mandate. its effect on worker hours. employers hiring. and the number of businesses subjected to the penalty. We have a right to know that. The healthcare.gov Web site. its security. functionality. and verification systems. We have read a lot about that. but we have a right to know. Duties of the Internal Revenue Service. plans for calculating subsidy overpayments and underpayments. how they will notify these individuals and what their plans are for recapturing these overpayments. Medicare cuts via the IPAB. they will provide an analysis of the impact on medical outcomes for our seniors as a result of these cuts. We should know that. All of these questions could and should be answered by a special inspector general. The bill would equip the special IG with the same investigative and law enforcement authority as standing inspectors general. including subpoena and audit powers to compel responses from the administration. President Obama has claimed that hishisis ""the most transparent administration in history"" and that his administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government. Given these statements. I think the President should embrace the idea of a special inspector general for his health care law. After all. we need to know the outcomes of the 41 changes he has already made to the law. It would provide increased transparency so the general public has a better understanding about this law. It would protect taxpayer dollars. and by providing an independent analysis of this law. it will allow the administration and Congress to make more informed decisions and work together on how we move forward with reforms to our health care system. I believe we need to do everything possible to repeal and replace this law with real health care reformreforms that lower costs and restore the allimportant relationship between a patient and a doctor. However. as long as this law is on the books. we need a watchdog or a special inspector general to investigate the implementation of this law and ensure that our scarce taxpayer dollars are being spent in an appropriate manner. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in support of this bill in calling for increased oversight of the affordableor unaffordablehealth care law. Lets ride out of the box canyon. Lets get on a better health care reform trail. and on the way we certainly dont have to sit on every cactus that comes along. By Ms. WARREN (for herself. Mr."
1130124094,"Mr. President. I would like to amplify the remarks made recently by my colleague from Utah Senator HATCH. our distinguished ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. concerning the yearend tax legislationwhat is called the tax extenders bill. Senator HATCH was entirely correct. it seems to me. when he said that getting this legislation through the Senate had been an ordeal. an unnecessary ordeal not only for the Senate but more particularly for every person in business back home in my State of Kansas and also throughout the countryUtah. Kansas. wherever in the United States. I am talking about farmers. ranchers. small business owners. manufacturers and all of their employees. in other words. the backbone of our economy. It is a real shame that the longer term extenders deal developed by the chairmen of the tax committees and the leaders in the House and Senateyes. you heard me right. both chairmen in the House and Senate and both leadershave agreed that basically this deal that was reached before the Thanksgiving holiday has collapsed. The deal included a number of very critical items. including a permanent simplification of the research credit that would help businesses plan and invest in jobcreating innovation. The package also included a number of provisions for which I had worked very hard. including special depreciation and expensing rules that are very important to agriculture and small business. The plan also included bipartisan legislation I developed with Senator SCHUMER to modify the research and development tax credit so it could be more easily used by smaller businesses. where the bulk of technological innovation occurs. The plan also included longterm extension of legislation I have pushed to make sure smaller businesses are able to access the capital they need to grow and hire new employees. These provisions are not giveaways. They free up capital and cash that can be invested and recycled into economic growth. That is a good thing. We should have done that. These provisions do not fit within the class warfare debateactually. it is not a debate but rather a diversionary tactic that actually took place. that shouldnt have even been mentioned. A veto should never have even been forthcoming from the White House. I have heard the complaint the proposal was too business focused. Since business today is mired in a swamp of regulation and guessing games and unpredictability. the focus of a socalled taxextenders bill should have darn well been focused on business. Not every person in America works for our growing government. The deal would have also helped individual taxpayers. from teachers taking a deduction for school supplies they purchase with their own money to help for homeowners who have defaulted on a mortgage or faced financial hardship. to deductions for college tuition and expenses. These provisions would keep more money in the pocket of taxpayers. a better place for it. The package represented months of goodfaith work by the tax committees and leadership in both Houses of Congress. something unique that we have not experienced around here for quite a while. Obviously. the deal wasnt perfect by any stretch. but it would have been a great downpayment for true tax reform. Most of all. it would have brought certainty and clarity to tax policy. something we sorely need and which is long overdue. Let me give an example of what I mean. Earlier this week I visited with farmers in Kansas at the annual Kansas Farm Bureau meetingabout 1.000 farmers attended. One farmer. who shared his views so pretty much everybody around him could hear. told me he had recently purchased new farm equipmentcombines and tractors so his family could step up work on their land. expand their operation. and he was upset. Actually. he was not upset. he was mad because. according to him. ""weve been messing around in Washington too much with the extenders bill."" He was mad because if the equipment expensing rules arent extended. he is out many thousands of dollars. That is just a portion of what has been spent. But that is money he would have used to buy more equipment or more landthe productive use of capitaland not some trivial amount used for a vacation or something else. It is not just this farmer. My phone has been ringing off the hook all month with calls from farmers. ranchers. equipment dealers. and other businesses that need to know whether this will get extended. and they. too. are upsetmake that mad. They are frustrated. and they need us to get to work to help them run their businesses and their lives. Yes. even with the recent blowup. we will extend these tax provisions but only for 1 yeara monthand then we will be back at it again next year. and these folks will be in the same position. the same kind of purgatory. wondering whether we will ever come to our senses. wondering whether to buy that new tractor or buy the new production line or to hire new employees. Every day when I visit with business owners and taxpayers in Kansas I hear over and over one simple refrain: Senator. we need certainty in the Tax Code. We need to be able to rely on a stable tax system so we can plan and grow our business. Senator Pat. the Congress needs to do something about these tax extenders. I couldnt agree more. and I think most of us. if not all of us on the Senate Finance Committee. couldnt agree more. The lack of certainty about these tax provisions is bad for American families. It is bad for business looking to create jobs. and it is bad for our economy. It leaves businesses unable to plan ahead and invest because they are left in the dark about what tax provisions will affect their operations. So what happened to the deal? Why are we at this point debating another kick of the can down the road? The imperial Presidency has happened. The President has decided that instituting an Executive amnesty was the best course of action before the end of the year. President Obamas immigration grenade doomed the tax extenders deal. Real negotiations unraveled. a veto threat was issued. and the bipartisan compromises were killed. Because of President Obamas mywayorthehighway approach to leadership and to amnesty. Congress is now forced to once again cobble together a 1year tax policy patch that basically nobody wants. This hurts families. job creators. farmers. ranchers. teacherseveryone who needs to plan ahead to succeed. So instead of working with Congress to develop an immigration reform compromise. we have the most arrogant attack on the Constitution I have ever seen. Once again the President placed partisan politics above the needs of the middle classour workers and business owners. our students. our teachers. and indeed our entire economy. Without this unprecedented illegal Executive order. we would right now be discussing a longterm extension of these vital tax provisions. We could maybe even have voted on it as of this yearas of this weeklaying a strong base for comprehensive tax reform. Instead. the President has sacrificed jobproducing tax policy for the expedience of Executive action. As I have said elsewhere. the President has seemingly no interest in a constructive working relationship with Congress. He didnt have any intention of listening to the will of the American people. and he has no respect for the constitutional boundaries of his office. This is beyond troubling. but its spillover into other areas. such as tax policy. does not bode well for the bipartisan development of policy to build the economy we so desperately need and that we were so close to achieving. But let us be hopeful. Maybe something good will come out of this whole situation. Maybe we will recognize the level of dysfunction illustrated by the Executive order. and I hope it will point us back to regular order. It is critically important that we return to regular order in the Senate. in particular with all of the major fiscal issues we face. Bringing the extenders package to the Finance Committee was a strong sign that we mean business and that we are ready to move on a bipartisan basis to address the fiscal issues that are facing the country. Sadly. that effort was sabotaged. Without that action. we would be moving toward a more sensible. bipartisan. progrowth extenders bill and perhaps well on our way to tax reform. That we are not is a shame. It didnt have to be this way. Mr. President. I yield the floor."

1130006841,Mr. President. today Senator MERKLEY and I are introducing the Corps of Engineers Recreation Improvement Act. This legislation enables the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reinvest recreation fees to improve facilities where the funds are collected. Our bill creates an incentive for the Corps to maintain good facilities and provide quality recreational opportunities on our public lands. The Corps currently collects recreation fees at many sites. This legislation would not change the way the Corps determines use fee rates. Existing law provides that users of specialized sites. facilities. equipment. or services provided by Federal expense shall be assessed fair and equitable fees. Section 210 of the Flood Control Act of 1968 also provides that no entrance fees shall be charged by the Corps. Our bill is not intended to and does not make any changes in that regard. In Arkansas. recreation on our public Corpsoperated lands is an important driver of economic activity. job opportunities. and tourism. In fiscal year 2012. over $4.2 million in revenue was collected at Corps recreation sites in Arkansas. When citizens spend money at Corps recreation sites in Arkansas. Oregon. or other States. many of them expect that their money will be invested onsite to improve facilities and create recreation opportunities. Our bill would ensure those expectations are met. The Corps of Engineers Recreation Improvement Act would also enable the Corps to participate in the interagency America the Beautiful Pass program to allow customers an alternative payment option at sites where entrance or amenity fees are charged. This includes the distribution and sale of the passes and the retention of a portion of the revenue for the sales of those passes. It would also allow the Corps to distribute Military Passes. This will make it easier for our men and women in uniform and their families to acquire passes. The Corps currently honors these passes but the Corps is not allowed to distribute the passes. Providing the ability for the Corps to offer passes to customers is a commonsense solution that will encourage continued use of Federal recreation sites. By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. MERKLEY):
1130048978,"Madam President. I appreciate the Senator from South Dakota and his words but also his leadership. not only in this area but in so many areas of such importance facing our Nation. Again. we appreciate him very much. With the exchanges set to open in a matter of days. we are getting an upclose and personal look at how bad this law is for Arkansans. On Monday. the ObamaCare premiums were released for the Arkansas exchanges. The exchanges were supposed to provide choices. The President said it would be like booking travel on Expedia. Do you know how many insurance companies you can pick from in el Dorado and Magnolia? Two. In Pine Bluff. Helena. and Lake Village? Two. In Jonesboro and Hot Springs? Three. There are not a lot of options. and none of them are affordable. Sticker shock. I think. is the best way to describe the response I have heard from Arkansans. Yesterday. a caller to my Fort Smith office said he could barely afford his diabetic medicine. With the new premiums. he simply cannot afford it. That is one example of many similar calls i have received and am receiving. With a pricetag of nearly $3 trillion. the law creates more problems than it solves. It drives up health care costs. busts our budget. bankrupts Medicare. and deflates our economy. On top of that. it does not create economic stability for Arkansans. It raises their taxes. On some level. even President Obama acknowledges this will not work. He has delayed. without legal recourse. the employer health care mandate. More relief for other allies will certainly come. It is clear the White House is picking and choosing who has to comply with the law. which leaves the rest of America asking: Where is my exemption? Why cant everyone get a special deal? They rightfully want to know why they have to follow a law the Presidents allies are not following. Every Republican in this Chamber wrote the President shortly after he made this decision to delay the employer mandate. We demanded that he extend relief to the public. In fact. we asked him to permanently delay implementation for everyone. Senator COATS and I. along with several other of our colleagues. have introduced a bill that would accomplish just that because this law is not just bad for U.S. businesses. it is bad for workers. it is bad for American families. The President says he is working for a ""better bargain for the middle class."" This law crushes the middle class. It is going to make coverage unaffordable for everyone. including the very people the President seeks to provide coverage tolowincome workers. Because this law is poorly written. a worker making $21.000 a year may be offered plans with premiums that are near $2.000. How is this affordable? For a basic plan they could also face an annual deductible upwards of $3.000 before coverage kicks in. That is almost a quarter of the annual salary of a worker making $21.000. And this is supposed to be affordable? One of my constituents hit the nail on the head during a telephone townhall I had on Monday night when he said this law is actually making health insurance more expensive for the average person. Nowhere in the 20.000 pages of regulations can you find one that drives down the cost of health care. That is the core of the problem. This law has to be replaced with reforms that drive down the cost of health care and make insurance truly affordable for every American. Instead of allowing the government to dictate our health care needs. we should strive to reward quality health care. encourage healthy living. and minimize waste through patient choice and health care ownership. We should pass laws that expand health savings accounts. We should allow small businesses. people such as my barber. to pool together with other barbers and purchase group insurance to cover their employees at a low rate. We need to allow Americans to purchase insurance across State lines. as we do for car insurance. There are other reform avenues we can explore. some I think that we can even get the majority and the President to support. Every Republican in this Chamber wants to do away with this law. We may disagree on strategy. but we all seek the same goal. For me and many of my colleagues. it is hard to find the logic in opposing a bill that defunds ObamaCare. Again. this bill the House has sent us is exactly what we were trying to accomplish. It defunds ObamaCare and keeps the government open. We must also ensure it keeps us on a path to fiscal responsibility. If the majority leader attempts to restore funding for ObamaCare. you can be assured that I will vote against it. My vocal opposition to the law. my record of voting against the original bill. and my support of efforts to repeal it are evidence that I want to replace this law with real reform that will drive down the cost of care and increase coverage for all. However. at the end of the day. it is not wise to force a shutdown by holding up a bill to continue the funding of government. Our troops in harms way deserve to be paid. Seniors in Arkansas need their Social Security checks in a timely manner just to get by. And Arkansans who have jobs that require government actionregardless of the situationwill have their livelihoods at stake as a result of a shutdown. Perhaps most concerning is what a shutdown could do to the markets in this very fragile economy. Our economy is in a far more precarious position than it was during the last shutdown. The retirement and savings of millions of Arkansans could take a dramatic hit. We face a serious crisis. Health care costs are crippling this country and many Americans lack access to quality affordable care. It is stifling our Nations overall economic development. These are real difficulties patients. physicians. and hospitals face. I understand this problem firsthand. For 24 years. I practiced optometry with my brother and my partners in Arkansas. My experience as both a health care practitioner and a clinic owner led me to understand there is a right way and a wrong way to address this crisis. The Presidents health care law is the wrong way. Lets move forward by supporting the Housepassed continuing resolution that defunds ObamaCare. Lets work together for affordable and effective health care reforms through free market principles. I yield the floor."
1130055051,"Mr. President. this past weekend I was with a group of heroes from the ""greatest generation."" These men and women faced some of the biggest challenges our Nation has seen. They put aside their own needs to make the country and the world a better place. These World War II veterans from Arkansas were flown in on an Honor Flight to see their memorial. They didnt have much to say to me personally about the shutdown. We talked about it. but talked more about the branch of the service they were in. what they did during the war. and the various things that happened to them during that periodand. of course. about Razorback football. We didnt have to spend and take time to visit a great deal about the shutdown for me to know their thoughts. Their presence alone was enough of a reminder that we need to solve this issue. As the shutdown drags on. it spills into the debt ceiling discussion. These are two major issues with very serious impacts if left unresolved. To everyone outside of the Beltway. it seems both sides are digging their heels in deeper. both sides are ratcheting up the rhetoric. and nothing is getting done. The American people are tired of this. Dismissing the other sides offers without consideration and trading barbs do not help out one bit. No one is being asked to abandon their principles. What needs to happen. however. is both sides must respect the will of the American people. We must find a way to do what the public demandsreopen the government and get our spending under control. The President and the Senate majority want to say that their health care law is an entirely separate issue from this debate. That is simply untrue. It is not the way Americans see it. One major reason the American people are rejecting it is because of its budgetbusting pricetag. We have a budget that cant be strained any further. Our debt stands at almost $17 trillion. and $6 trillion of that has been added on President Obamas watch. You cant take on that much debt and pretend it is not a problem. Americans do not have the luxury of telling their credit card company to stop calling because they do not want to pay the debt that they racked up. This mess could be avoided if we simply followed regular order here in Washington. but we have not done that in 10 years. What I mean by that is during my time in the Senate we have passed one individual appropriations bill prior to the end of the previous fiscal year. We didnt consider a single appropriations bill on the Senate floor last year. Lets return to regular order by passing an annual budget and the accompanying spending bills. not one large bill. The good news is that many Members on both sides believe we simply need to get that done. But that doesnt get us out of our current mess. We have to get the government operating again. and we have to avoid a default. Impassioned debates on major decisions like raising the debt ceiling in the past have resulted in positive policy changes. In fact. half of the 53 times Congress has agreed to raise the debt ceiling since 1978. they have attached conditions to it. The GrammRudman act is a perfect example. We talked a lot about the need to cap spending in Washington. GrammRudman actually did that. and it lead to a balanced budget. Even the situation we are currently in with the Budget Control Act was born out of this type of constraint. Some in the Chamber still are not happy with that. but the Budget Control Act is the first time in a long time that we have managed to curb the growth in Washington spending. Anyone who has ever bought a house or a car can tell you that it takes some time to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. There is lots of haggling involved. The owner says here is what it costs. The consumer makes an offer in return. This brings a counteroffer and so on. This continues until both parties reach an agreement where everyone is satisfied. But the key to this process is that both parties have to engage in the discussion. Everybody needs to come to the table. It is simply not enough to say this is where I stand and I will not take any other options into consideration. I am fairly certain you will never buy a house with that approach. The good news is it seems we are heading in a positive direction. I believe there is movement toward a consensus. At the very least. both sides seem to be coming out of their respective corners and discussing their options. We need everyone to come to the table. to develop a way forward that puts us on the path to fiscal responsibility. These discussions serve as a starting point for how to rein in reckless spending so we can eliminate the blank check. the philosophy that has become so pervasive in this town. If we need inspiration to solve this problem. the men and the women I visited with at the World War II Memorial this past weekend are a perfect place to look. They have accurately been named the ""greatest generation"" in part for their willingness to take on enormous challenges because it was the right thing to do. We have an enormous challenge in front of us now. Lets follow the inspiration of the ""greatest generation."" Lets put our country before ourselves and solve this problem. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1130072411,Madam President. surprisingly. the President didnt talk much about ObamaCare. his signature achievement. The people of Arkansas. the people of America certainly are talking a great deal about it and they are writing a great deal about it also. The reason is because they are so concerned that health care has become an absolute mess. The President talked about a single mom who was able to resolve the problem of her preexisting conditions. I think we all agree that is something that was desperately needed. I am an optometrist. an eye doctor. and very much aware of the situations people have been put in. in the past. Although the reality is we can fix this problemproblems such as thiswithout creating a massive bureaucracy. without creating a situation where we have thousands of pages of regulations. and the reality is the unintended consequences of the situation we are in now with ObamaCare is that we have made it unaffordable. We have made it such that millions of Americans simply cannot afford the health insurance they are being offered. Let me talk about a few people who have written to me to talk about their situation. Jack from Springdale writes: I just found out recently from my current health insurance provider that my current health insurance policy will be discontinued effective the first of next year. and a replacement policy will be approximately double which will be around $1.200 per month. My question is. is this what ObamaCare was supposed to do? And if not. what can be done about it? Leonard and JoAnne write: This letter comes to you to ask for your needed support to defeat/defund the Affordable Care Act in any way possible. We recently received notification from Health Advantage of Arkansas that our 2014 monthly premiums increased $173.70 for a total of $1.360.06. Our out of pocket max increased from $3.000 to $5.000. the primary care physician copay increased from $25 to $35 and the specialist copay increased from $35 to $70. If either of us has to visit the ER. that copay increased from $100 to $250 dollars. The drug copay also increased. We are insulted to have to pay for benefits such as maternity. pediatric dental. and drug rehab which we have no need for since we are in our 60s and do not use drugs or alcohol. Health Advantage of Arkansas explained that these changes to our policy and increased costs were due to compliance to ACA. We have supported you in the past and would like to know what your plan is to relieve Arkansans and other Americans from these additional financial burdens imposed upon us by the Affordable Care Act. Mary in Little Rock writes that she received a notice that her MediPak Advantage plan was canceled at the end of last year. She explains: I had no idea that Obamacare was going to also affect Medicare. Now. to receive comparable coverage for 2014. I will have to pay an additional $500+ in premiums. This additional cost will definitely place an unfair burden on my finances. What are you & the Senate going to do to correct this situation? I think Mary asks a very fair question. What are we going to do to correct her situation and the situation of so many others? I think the answer is we need to repeal ObamaCare. We need to put in place a system that does take care of the problems we have but without the bureaucracy. without the tremendous expense. and make health care affordable for all Americans. I yield back.
1130076064,Madam President. I stand here as someone who is very interested in our Nations veterans. We owe the men and women who stood in defense of our Nation the care and services they deserve for the sacrifices they have made for our country. My dad served in the Air Force for over 20 years. and his service and sacrifice is in no small part why I am a Member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. and previously the House Veterans Affairs Committee. I requested to be a member of the Veterans Affairs Committees in both Chambers because we made a commitment to take care of those who put their lives on the line for our safety and ideals. and I believe in carrying out the promise. During my days as a Member of the House of Representatives. my mom would routinely ask me when I would see her: What have you done for our veterans lately? I was happy to talk about the programs and services we promoted. supported. and passedand certainly in a very bipartisan way. There is a long list of accomplishments of which we can be very proud. from modernizing the GI bill so our veterans can get the education they need to succeed in life after the military. to helping our veterans pursue their dreams of owning a business. to improving the medical services our veterans need for the wounds they have suffered while serving our country. Unfortunately. problems exist. In my Arkansas officeand I think this is true of most congressional officeswe have a number of dedicated staffers. In fact. we have three dedicated staffers who handle veteransrelated issues. They help cut through the redtape of the Department of Veterans Affairs to get the care and attention our veterans have earned. Last year. more than 40 percent of the assistance we provided to Arkansans that involved Federal agencies focused on veterans issues. Increasing funding doesnt necessarily mean we will have better outcomes. Take for instance the claims backlog. This is a huge problem impacting hundreds of thousands of veterans nationwide. Even some of the simplest claims are stuck in the process. Since 2009. the number of claims pending for over 1 year has grown. despite a 40 percent increase in the VAs budget. The most recent statistics for the Little Rock VA Regional Office showed 7.663 total claims are pending. Nearly 54 percent have been in the process for more than 125 days. The regional office averages nearly 217 days to complete a claim. Thanks to the hard work and commitment of Arkansans who work at the VA. we are making progress on the backlog at the Little Rock office. but there is still work to be done for our veterans. Take. for instance. the retired lieutenant colonel in Arkansas who is eligible for benefits he earned for his service in the military. He is not receiving the correct pay. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service approved his paperwork in August and sent it to the VA. It has been 6 months and still no decision has been made. This is an easy case. and it simply shouldnt take that long. Retired CSM Richard Green lives in Sherwood and has already received his retirement benefits. but he filed for benefits for his wife the month after they married in October 2012. It took 16 months to process that paperworkmuch longer than he was used to during active military service when this sort of paperwork was fixed within one or two paychecks. Every part of the claims process is overwhelmed and bogged down. Paul Cupp from Fort Smith. AR. has been working on his VA appeal since 2009. He was happy to get part of it approved in 2013. after 4 years of waiting. However. months later. he is still waiting for his rating to get updated and to see the actual benefits from that decision. And the widows of our veterans are not exempt from this backlog. One Arkansan in her seventies has been working on her claim since 2005. and is still awaiting a decision on appeal. Nine years is certainly unacceptable. Instead of fixing the existing challenges our veterans are facing through fully implementing what we have committed ourselves to. increasing accountability and improving efficiency. some of my colleagues think the best way to tackle this is by expanding programs and increasing the responsibility of the VA. The problem is we are putting more people in a system which is clearly overwhelmed and needs improvement. This isnt the fault of the VA. which I believe is fully committed to meeting all the demands our veterans and Congress expect from them. However. the VA can only do so much. As the number of veterans and the complicated nature of their needs increases. we must not pile on additional responsibilities which overwhelm the agency. With the announcement by Senator Hagel of a potentially significant drawdown in the military. many more individuals will come into the VA system. While the bill before us has worthwhile programs which I support and have championed. we should not expect a massive mandate imposed on VA to change the outcomes we experience. We need a measured approach to changes. They must be done over time and include oversight to make sure our veterans are receiving the attention they deserve in a timely manner. Madam President. I yield the floor.
1130098322,Mr. President. I wish to offer my thoughts and prayers to the victims of the April 27. 2014. tornadoes that devastated a number of communities in central Arkansas. The tornadoes that spawned from the storm system that left a trail of destruction across the south took the lives of 16 Arkansans in Pulaski. White and Faulkner Counties. The Arkansas victims include an Iraq veteran who died while protecting his 5yearold daughter. two children who had just started school in Vilonia. and an unborn child who died as a result of the injuries to the babys mother. While others escaped the tornadoes with their lives. many lost everything else they had. From homes to businesses. entire communities were wiped out leaving many residents homeless and without livelihood. However. our actions in a time of crisis are a reflection of us as a society and despite the tragic stories we saw many uplifting acts before. during. and after the tornadoes hit. As the storm approached. Christian Gunther acted to save ten disabled veterans from a longterm care facility by making sure they reached safety before the tornado hit. During the storm. MSG Daniel Wassom. gave his life using his body to shield his daughter from a falling beam. And. in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Arkansass first responders rushed to the hardest hit communities. saving lives in the aftermath of the tornadoes. During this time where many have to sift through the rubble and rebuild their lives. we are grateful for those who have reached out to their neighbors and provided assistance. Volunteers from all across the State have come to ravaged areas to help. This disaster serves as a testament to the compassionate character of the people of Arkansas. Rebuilding is never easy. but I know that Arkansans do not give up. I am pleased the President quickly responded to the situation by designating four Arkansas counties as major disaster areas. making Federal funding available to people in these counties impacted by the storm. However. more work remains to be done. I am committed to ensuring that relief comes to the families and communities affected by this disaster. Again. our thoughts and prayers go out to those who endured the storms. who need to rebuild. and especially to those who have lost relatives and loved ones. I ask that my colleagues continue to keep them in their thoughts and prayers.*
1130098810,Mr. President. as the son of an Air Force master sergeant and a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. I take very seriously my responsibility to represent the interests of those who have served our country in uniform. When it comes to our Nations veterans. their commitment to country is without question. and our countrys commitment to them should be the same. Put simply. our veterans deserve better. That is why I am pleased to see that we have come together to address this crisis in the Senate. These men and women have served and sacrificed on behalf of a grateful nation. We need to ensure that they are getting the highquality services they have earned. Our veterans deserve a system that proves their care is our top priority. Unfortunately. the VA is struggling to meet the health demands for our veterans. The VA inspector general is currently investigating misconduct throughout the VA health system. In order to ensure accountability. we have to give the VA the ability to fire and demote senior executive service employees who are responsible for these types of abuses. Under current law. senior VA employees are nearly untouchable. That means the very people responsible for hiding the true extent of wait times. for instance. and other abuses cannot be fired. That is incredible when you think about it. We cannot tolerate bad actors who abuse their power and put our veterans in danger. That is why a key component of this bill gives the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to fire or demote senior VA employees for poor performance. Accountability is the goal here. However. that goes beyond individual employees. The Department itself needs to be held accountable for its shortcomings. So it is time we shine a light on the VA. This bill would also establish an electronic waiting list that would be made available to veterans on the Departments Web site so everyone can see the average waiting time for an appointment at each VA medical center for specific types of care and services. New wait time goals would also be published on the Departments Web site and in the Federal Register within 90 days of the bills enactment. Earlier this week we saw an audit which revealed that veterans seeking care for the first time waited an average of 60 days in the Little Rock VA hospital and 52 days in the Fayetteville hospital. Clearly. these results need to be improved and indicate the failure of the VA to meet its goal of seeing new patients within 14 days. I am committed to ensuring that the VA uses every available option it has to deliver on its mission for all veterans who have earned this care. And if it cannot. this bill gives our veterans the ability to seek that care elsewhere. The bill we are considering today would establish a 2year program that allows veterans who have been unable to obtain care from the VA for providing service to seek care from private providers. This option would also be provided to those who live more than 40 miles from a VA facility. including a communitybased outpatient clinic. The government would be obligated to reimburse the nonVA health care provider for the services provided to the veteran. Wait times and secret lists are not the only problem within the VA health system. We are learning now that qualityofcare issues on a range of critical care outcomes. including mortality and infection rates. are willingly being ignored by senior VA management. We need to restore faith in the VA health care system. and that begins with accountability and following through with our promises. The crisis surrounding the VA health care system shows an immediate need to improve timely access to medical care for our veterans. The VA needs to correct the systemic problems that are preventing our veterans from accessing the highquality health care services offered. I am pleased we are taking action on this important issue. and I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation before us because we need to improve the health services our veterans earned and deserve.
1130117827,Mr. President. last month we marked the 24th anniversary of the beginning of the gulf war. In August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait. Shortly after this development the United States launched Operation Desert Shield. which led to Operation Desert Storm to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. Arkansas made a huge sacrifice during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The Arkansas Army National Guard had 13 units called to serve during these operations. and 10 units of the Arkansas Air National Guard were called up. More than 3.400 Arkansas Guard soldiers were called up altogetherthe second highest percentage of any State. Of those Arkansans called to serve. nine of the Army Guard units served in combat. including the 142nd Field Artillery Brigadethe only National Guard artillery brigade called to Active Duty during the gulf war. I thank all of the men and womenmore than 600.000 Americans from across the United Stateswho served and sacrificed in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. These servicemembers deserve a place of honor and recognition in our Nations Capital. My friend and colleague Senator DONNELLY and I have been working toward that goal. I am proud of my colleagues in the House who unanimously passed H.R. 503. the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act in May. I ask that we bring this bill up for final passage here in the Senate. In a time where we are facing budget constraints. this bill is budget neutral. Private funds for construction of the memorial will be raised by the National Desert Storm War Memorial Association. This bill simply authorizes the establishment of a monument on Federal lands here in our Nations Capital. which is what Congress needs to act on to honor all of those men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. Passing this bill will be a great step in honoring our gulf war veterans. I am grateful to have the support of the full Senate and look forward to a swift ultimate passage. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 403. H.R. 503. I further ask that the bill be read a third time and passed. and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
1130126881,"Madam President. I rise today to congratulate the Reed family for earning the distinction of 2014s Arkansas Farm Family of the year. This honor reflects the dedication of Nathan and Kristin Reed to farming and the importance they play in Arkansass number one industry. Nathan is a fourthgeneration farmer. I know that he will pass along his passion for farming to the couples young children. 2yearold twins Stanley ""Eldon"" and JaneAnne and 1yearold Katherine. The Reeds farm cotton. corn and soybeans on their Lee County farm where they emphasize conservation and sustainability. Using variable rate technology for applying fertilizer and irrigation wells and center pivot systems run off electric power. they save energy. Nathan is also constantly learning about different crops and crop rotating practices by experimenting on the farm. The Reeds are not only committed to farming and producing safe supplies of food and fiber to the world. but they are also committed to their community. Nathan serves on numerous boards and committees. As a longtime friend of the Reed family I understand the importance of farming. agriculture and community involvement that Nathans father Stanley and his mother Charlene encouraged. Nathan is following in their footsteps. They were named the Lee County Farm Family of the Year in The Arkansas Farm Bureaus program honors farm families across the State for their outstanding work both on their farms and in their communities. This recognition is a reflection of the contribution to agriculture at the community and State level and its implications for improved farm practices and management. The Reeds are welldeserving of this honor. I congratulate Nathan. Kristin. Stanley. JaneAnne and Katherine on their outstanding achievements in agriculture and ask my fellow colleagues to join me in honoring them for this accomplishment. I wish them continued success in their future endeavors and look forward to the contributions they will continue to will offer Arkansas farming and agriculture.*"

1130006551,Liz Chesterman was an honors graduate from Hollins University in Virginia. Then she got her Ph.D. in molecular biology. Then she became a patent agent with the largest law firm in South Carolina. And she still wasnt done. At night. she would sit in the kitchen and study for the LSAT. She was going to go to law school. She wanted to be a doctor and a lawyer. But her greatest accomplishment was her character. She was smart. hardworking. a source of joy and inspiration in the lives of everyone who worked with her and knew her. And with just a little bit of luck. Madam Speaker. Liz Chesterman could be speaking to you from the floor of the House of Representatives. With just a little bit of luck. she would be representing South Carolina in Congress. But shes not in the House of Representatives. Madam Speaker. Shes in a cemetery in Fort Wayne. Indiana. Her husband couldnt stand her success. so he abused her. She tried to escape. and she almost made it. She made it to the back door. where he met her with a shovel. and he broke every single bone in her face. And then he nearly decapitated her. leaving her in a pool of blood in the kitchen where she used to study for the LSAT. I run into her mom from time to time. Madam Speaker. in South Carolina. She comes back for a victims right service. Shes just like Liz. warm and compassionate. And she always asks: What can I do to help? Imagine that. a mother who lost a daughter in such a horrific way wants to help. And that got me wondering. well. maybe we should be asking what we can do to help because we really can help. We can provide women a safe harbor. We can provide the means to leave abusive relationships. We can provide women the counseling that they need. We can accelerate the prosecution of sexual assault cases so women dont have to wait and wonder and worry about whether or not theyre going to be abused again before the case gets to trial. We can do all of that. but. I think. Madam Speaker. we can do more. F- 1110 When my daughter was little. she would ask me to look under her bed for monsters. and I did. But as our little girls grow into women. we realize the monsters are not under the bed. The monsters are in the bed and in the den and in the kitchen and on the college campuses and walking the halls of the high schools and on the computer and on the phone. And for some women. especially today. the monster is this broken political system that we have. a broken political system which manufactures reasons to oppose otherwise good bills just to deny one side a victory. The House version protects every single American. period. but it will not get a single Democrat vote because it is our version. Welcome to our broken political system. I never ask a victim if she is a Republican or a Democrat. I never ask a police officer if he or she is a Republican or a Democrat. I never ask a counselor if she is a Republican or a Democrat. I never ask the parents of a victim if they are a Republican or a Democrat because there are some things that ought to be bigger than politics. and protecting people who cannot protect themselves ought to be one of them. And I had hoped that the House bill would allow us. Madam Speaker. to join arms and walk on a common journey of protecting people who are innocent and cannot protect themselves. And I had hoped. Madam Speaker. that this fractured body could possibly be healed by something that ought to be nonpartisan. like protecting women against violence. And I had hoped. Madam Speaker. that just for 1 day. just 1 day. we will stop scoring political points against each other and try to score political points for other people. And I had hoped. Madam Speaker. that just for 1 day this body could speak with one clear. strong voice for all the women who are too tired and too scared and too hurt and too dead to speak for themselves. I had hoped that today would be the day. Maybe next time. Madam Speaker. maybe next time.
1130071787,Mr. Speaker. one of the most enjoyable parts of our job is speaking to children at schools. and you get some tough and interesting questions. A couple of months ago. a precious child at a school in upstate South Carolina asked me who was the most famous person I had ever met. That is a very good question. I told the child. I have met President Bush. I have met President Obama. I have met JOHN LEWIS. I have met PAUL RYAN. I have met Bono. the lead singer of U2. I have met McGruff. the Crime DogI have even met TIM SCOTTbut I told the child the most famous person I had ever met was his teacher. and we all smiled and laughed. But it did get me thinking. Mr. Speaker. that we are surrounded by fame. We fly into an airport named for Reagan. We work in a town named for Washington. We pass monuments to Jefferson and Lincoln and Dr. King. The buildings we work in are named for famous people. and within those buildings are statues and portraits of still more famous people. We are surrounded by fame. Mr. Speaker. and it is easy to forget that. while those people made contributions to our country. the country was built. is being built. and will continue to be built by average. ordinary women and men who lead quiet lives of conviction and courageaverage folks doing above average things. ordinary folks doing extraordinary things. That is the essence of who we are as a people. and while there may not be a monument or a portrait dedicated to those ordinary men and women. there is something even better. and it is called a legacy. So. in honor of those women and men. Mr. Speaker. who lead quiet lives of conviction. I want to honor a man who was just like them. Bruce Cash was a pharmacist in my hometown of Spartanburg. He was buried last weekway too soon. in my opinion. but such are the ways of the Lord. He was a pharmacist. so we saw him when we were sick. and more importantly. we saw him when our children were sick. He was compassionate. and he was kind. and he acted like you were the only person he was taking care of that day. He was active in his church. doing everything from driving a bus on choir tour. to being chairman of the Board of Deacons. to taking his vacation time to chaperone other peoples children while they went and sang to prisoners in prisons. He was a devoted father and husband. He and his wife. Kitty. had six children and scores of grandchildren. and when you walked into his pharmacy. Mr. Speaker. you didnt see his business license. and you didnt see his pharmacy licenseyou saw a picture of his children. He wanted to quietly signal to you that that was the most important thing in his life. I would tell you. Mr. Speaker. to look up Bruce Cash on the Internet. but you are not going to find much. In fact. he never even bothered to change the name of his pharmacy. He left on his pharmacy the name of the man who owned it before him. He had the quality that best defined the Lord Jesus that he believed in. which is humility. He didnt want to talk about himself. he wanted to talk about you. He didnt want to tell you his opinion. he wanted to ask you your opinion. He didnt want to talk about his illness. he wanted to talk about your illness. He didnt want to talk about how life had dealt him an unplayable hand of cards. he wanted to talk about grace and hope and things that last beyond our lifetime. In conclusion. Bruce was humble. and he believed it was more important to live a sermon than to preach one. So I want to thank you. Bruce. for setting an example of average. ordinary people building this country. and the next time a child asks me who the most famous person is I have met. I will tell him it is you.
1130079395,"Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank Chairman GOODLATTE for his leadership on this bill and a host of others in the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Chairman. I want to have a pop quiz. That may seem unfair to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. but I am going to give them a hint: the answer to every one of the questions is the same. I am going to read a quote and then you tell me who said it: These last few years. we have seen an unacceptable abuse of power. having a President whose priority is expanding his own power. Any guess on who said that? Mr. Chairman. it was Senator Barack Obama. Here is another one: No law can give Congress a backbone if it refuses to stand up as the coequal branch the Constitution made it. That was Senator Barack Obama. What do we do with a President who can basically change what Congress passed by attaching a letter saying I dont agree with this part or that part? Senator Barack Obama. I taught the Constitution for 10 years. I believe in the Constitution. Senator Barack Obama. And my favorite. Mr. Chairman: One of the most important jobs of the Supreme Court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches. And I think the Chief Justice has been a little too willing and eager to give the President more power than I think the Constitution originally intended. So my question. Mr. Chairman. is how in the world can you get before the Supreme Court if you dont have standing? What did the President mean by that when he looked to the Supreme Court to rein in executive overreach? If you dont have standing. how can you possibly get before the Supreme Court? So my question is. Mr. Chairman. what has changed? How does going from being a Senator to a President rewrite the Constitution? What is different from when he was a Senator? Mr. Chairman. I dont think there is an amendment to the Constitution that I missed. I try to keep up with those with regularity. but what I do know is this: process matters. If you doubt it. Mr. Chairman. ask a prosecutor or a police officer. both of whom. as my friends on the other side of the aisle know. both of them are members of the executive branch. What happens when a police officer fails to check the right box on a search warrant application? The evidence is thrown out even though he was wellintended. even though he had good motivations. even though he got the evidence. because process matters. What happens when the police go and get a confession from the defendant? He did it. This is not a whodoneit. he admitted he did it. You got the right person for the right crime. but what happens if he doesnt follow the process? The defendant walks free. The criminal defense attorneys who are now Congressmen on the other side of the aisle know that is exactly what they argued when they were before the judge. not that the end justifies the means. Dont look at the motivations. look at the process. Mr. Chairman. we are not a country where the end justifies the means. no matter how good your motivations may be. We all swore an allegiance to the same document that the President swears allegiance to: to faithfully execute the law. So I will be listening intently during this debate for one of my colleagues to explain to me what does that phrase mean. What does it mean. not to execute the law. but when the Framers thought enough of that phrase to add the modifier ""faithfully""? What does that mean? If a President does not faithfully execute the law. Mr. Chairman. what are our remedies? Do we just sit and wait on another election? Do we use the power of the purse. the power of impeachment? Those are punishments. those are not remedies. The remedy is to do exactly what Barack Obama said to do: to go to court. to go to the Supreme Court and have the Supreme Court say once and for all. We dont pass suggestions in this body. Mr. Chairman. we dont pass ideas. we pass laws. and we expect them to be faithfully executed."
1130079513,Mr. Speaker. I want to talk for just a moment as colleaguesnot as Republicans or Democrats. not as members of the majority or the minority. but colleagues who are blessed to serve in the United States House of Representatives. the peoples House. with all the tradition. with all the history. with all the laws that have been passed. with all the lives that have been impacted. I want us to talk as colleagues. Because our foundational document gave us. as the House. unique powers and responsibilities. We run every 2 years because they intended for us to be closest to the people. The President was given different duties and powers. The President was given the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. So my question. Mr. Speaker. is what does that mean to you. that the laws be faithfully executed? We know the President can veto a bill for any reason or no reason. We know the President can refuse to defend the constitutionality of a statute. even one that he signs into law. We know the President can issue pardons for violations of the very laws that we pass. and we know the President has prosecutorial discretion. as evidenced and used through his U.S. attorneys. Mr. Speaker. that is a lot of power. What are we to do when that amount of power is not enough? What are we to do when this President. or any President. decides to selectively enforce a portion of a law and ignore other portions of that law? What do we do. Mr. Speaker. regardless of motivation. when a President nullifies our vote by failing to faithfully execute the law? How do we explain waivers and exemptions and delays in a bill passed by Congress and affirmed by the United States Supreme Court? How do we explain away a refusal to enforce mandatory minimums that were passed by Congress and affirmed by the Supreme Court? Why pursue. Mr. Speaker. immigration reform if Presidents can turn off the very provisions that we pass? You know. in the oaths that brand new citizens take. it contains six different references to the law. If it is good enough for us to ask brand new citizens to affirm their devotion to the law. is it too much to ask that the President do the same? If a President can change some laws. can he change all laws? Can he change election laws? Can he change discrimination laws? Are there any laws. under your theory. that he actually has to enforce? What is our recourse. Mr. Speaker? What is our remedy? Some would argue the Framers gave us the power of the purse and the power of impeachment. but Mr. Speaker. those are punishments. those are not remedies. What is the remedy if we want the Executive to enforce our work? This bill simply gives us standing when our votes are nullified. This bill allows us to petition the judicial branch for an order requiring the executive branch to faithfully execute the law. Mr. Speaker. we are not held in high public esteem right now. Maybe Members of Congress would be respected more if we respected ourselves enough to require that when we pass something. it be treated as law. Maybe we would be more respected if we had a firmly rooted expectation that when we pass something as law. it be treated as law. Maybe we would be more respected if we put down party labels and a desire to keep or retain or acquire the gavel and picked up the history. the tradition. and the honor of this. the peoples House. Mr. Speaker. the House of Representatives does not exist to pass suggestions. We do not exist to pass ideas. We make law. While you are free to stand and clap when any President comes into this hallowed Chamber and promises to do it. with or without you. I will never stand and clap when any President. no matter whether he is your party or mine. promises to make us a constitutional anomaly and an afterthought. We make law. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130109316,"Mr. Chairman. I again want to thank Mr. KLINE and all the hardworking folks on Education and the Workforce. the Members and especially the women and men of the staff. The Upstate of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman. is home to several higher education institutions. public and private. large and small. and the issue of education affordability is front and center. And. frankly. Mr. Chairman. families are struggling trying to be able to plan for their kids future. I know that. both because I have the benefit of representing these families and I hear from them and I also know it anecdotally. Mr. Chairman. I have a 17yearold daughter. and while she is blessed in many ways compared to her contemporaries. lots and lots of her friends come to the house from time to time. We preach to people that the road to prosperity is paved with hard work and education. but when this road is riddled with potholes called ""unsustainable debt."" I dont know how we can expect them to get to the end. You figure out what the cost of education is. In many of these instances. these children are the first ones in their family to try to go to school. And so they are looking at me. They have done well in high school. They have done everything we have asked them to do. and they are staring. in some instances. at massive amounts of debt just so they can do what we promised them that if you work hard and you get an education. the pathway to prosperity will be paved for you. So against that backdrop. my friend from Vermont and I decided lets look at regulations and what impact they may have on the cost of higher education. Mr. Chairman. as you well know. you may conclude that a regulation is worth it. It may cost money. but it may still be worth it. That is fine. That is a separate analysis. But there really is no reason to not study the regulations themselves to see what impact they are having. So I give a lot of credit to the gentleman from Vermont who approached me with his idea. I think it is a solid idea. I cant imagine any reason not to form a task force or a working group to study regulations and what impact. whether wittingly or unwittingly. those regulations are having on the cost of higher education. With that. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."

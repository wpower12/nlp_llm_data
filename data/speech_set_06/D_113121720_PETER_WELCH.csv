1130020823,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. To my colleague and my chair on the subcommittee. thank you for your fine leadership and for your leadership on this legislation as well. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to support H.R. 1580. As my colleague mentioned. it is a bill to affirm the policy of the United States to preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model that governs the Internet. It has worked. If it aint broke. dont fix it. The Internet has been a unique and powerful driver of social and economic progress. and it is changing nearly every part of the American economy and society. everything from education to health care delivery to agriculture. This is especially true for rural communities. where communications technology can have an even greater impact in areas where populations are small and distances are vast. The Internet enables connections from even the most farflung corners of our country to people. goods. and services around the globe. allowing rural America to compete just as effectively in the 21st century digital economy. A critical element of the Internets success story has been the open manner in which the Internet is governed. Rather than relying on centralized control by governments. the Internet instead adopts a multistakeholder model in which all who have an interest can have a voice in the Internets operation. Lately. however. the multistakeholder model towards Internet governance has been under assault on the global stage. At the World Conference on International Telecommunications in Dubai last December. as my colleague mentioned. the International Telecommunication Union adopted several proposals that could fundamentally alter the way the Internet operates. These proposals undermine the successful decentralized approach to Internet governance and impose a governmentcontrolled management regime. thereby threatening citizens access to content and information via the Internet as well as the global free flow of information online. I am pleased that Congress unanimously passed a resolution last year urging the administration to preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model. Thats what governs the Internet today. Thats what we want to govern the Internet tomorrow. I applaud the decision by the U.S. delegation not to sign that final treaty. but efforts to bring the Internet under the control of international regulatory bodies continues. This week. memberstates of the International Telecommunication Union will meet again in Geneva to debate issues surrounding global Internet governance. The passage of H.R. 1580 will be timely in. once again. demonstrating the unwavering support of our Congress of the multistakeholder Internet governance model. I want to thank Chairman UPTON. and I want to thank Chairman WALDEN. and their staff. for working with us on the Democratic side to address the concerns. Ranking Member WAXMAN and Ranking Member ESHOG raised these concerns during the bills markup in the Energy and Commerce Committee. We worked it out.
1130058150,I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker. part of this rule is addressing the debt ceiling. This Congress put the American people and our economy through the spectacle of 16 days of shutdown. with the culmination being the actual threat that we would not pay our bills. we would default. That is the second time we have done that in 2 years. There is some progress in this rule because it is going to allow Congress to vote to disapprove. but it cant pass unless it gets. in effect. the Presidents signature. There is another way that we ought to do this. We ought to. once and for all. acknowledge that if this Congress. with Republican and Democratic votes. passes an appropriation that has an impact on the debt ceiling. that is the time of reckoning at the moment that appropriation is passed. What we have done is a good deal hypocritical towards the people we represent. We will vote for spending on day one. and then on day two. when the bill comes due. we will vote against the debt ceiling increase that was required by the very vote we made. That is just not a standup way for a country to operate. We pay our bills. The idea that we would have a debate. as we did in this Congress. where the premise of that debate was that it was actually an acceptable outcome that we would stiff our creditors. that we wouldnt pay the mortgage. that we might forsake the 1 million veterans who are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and not provide to them the services that we have all promised. that is just not right. The damage we did with the debt ceiling debate and the threat to default was enormous both in August of 2011 and in October of 2013. In August of 2011. consumer confidence dropped to a 31year low. The third quarter gross domestic product increased barely at 1.4 percent. It led to. for the first time in the history of this country. us losing our AAA credit rating and suffering a downgrade from Standard & Poors. The loss of 0.3 percent of the fourth quarter growth rate translated into $24 billion of lost revenue. Household wealth collapsed by $2.4 trillion. While it is true that wealth has come back. the loss of that created an immense amount of insecurity. reduced consumer spending. and cost us jobs. The Peter Peterson Foundation indicated that the uncertainty that was created was something that contributed to $150 billion in lost output and 900.000 jobs. The October 2013 shutdown and the threat of default was the biggest plunge in consumer confidencebigger even than August of 2011the biggest plunge since the Lehman Brothers collapse in 08. We must acknowledge something very simple: we must pay our bills.
1130063057,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Barry. we are going to miss you. Everyone has been rightly singing your praises. I will tell you the couple of things I noticed right away. When I came. it was 2007. Many of the Members who have spoken have been here many years longer. When you went into the cloakroom. you were treated like you had been here forever. Everybody was treated the same. The goodwill. the good sense of humor. the good judgment. the sense that we are all part of something larger than ourselvesthat was something that Barry really conveyed. The other thing I noticed. we used to have pages here. Remember that? We had these young people full of hopes and dreams about how they could make a contribution in this country. how they could make this a better country. how they could be better people. Barry. it was amazing to watch you with those kids because you had to get them organized. They had to learn all of our names. They would be sitting there in the cloakroom studying the Congressional Pictorial. and these young kids from all over the country would be coming up. and they would be saying hi to Mr. MILLER. to Mr. WELCH. to Mr. CAPUANO. and it was such a reassuring observation. such a wonderful scene there where these kidsboys and girlsfelt that they had a big job in a big institution. You could see them getting excited about public service. and you could see them taking seriously the responsibilities that go along with it. which at that moment. for them. was learning the names and matching them to the faces of the people who were here. Barry. you were a great teacher. It wasnt just that they got our names right. It was that you inspired them to find in themselves the discipline and the strength to take that next step and to aspire to achieve their dreams. It is a life well lived when you can treat the people in it with love and respect. when you can commit yourself to the building of an institution. that you can help leave it behind in better shape than you found it. So. Barry. for all of us who served with you. seeing all the good deeds you have done for so many. thank you very much.
1130068119,"Thank you. Mr. COHEN. It is so wonderful to hear about our classmate. We who were elected with Gabby had a special privilege to get to know her personally and to see her grit and her determination and her gracefulness and her effectiveness representing her district. and the incredible job she did on the Armed Services Committee. I remember all of the things that you mentioned. and she had a kind word for everybody. She didnt forget anything. She was totally devoted to her staff and to her constituents. What a pleasure it was. All of us. I think. felt if Congress was filled with folks like Gabby Giffords. the world would be a better place. even Congress. Since her shooting 3 years ago. America has gotten a glimpse into that person of character and beauty that all of us got to know as a classmate. What an extraordinary person she is. I just want to read a little bit from her oped because it kind of captures things. When this happened 3 years ago. she mentions that she was allowed the opportunity for a new life. but she had planned to spend her 40s continuing her public service and starting a family with this wonderful man. her husband. who she married while she was in service here in Congress. Mark Kelly. Remember when we saw Mark Kelly struggling with the question of his wife in the hospital and having to decide whether to continue to command the mission into space. and how he struggled with that. wanting to be doing what he was trained all his life to do. and be also the extraordinary husband that he was. and how Gabby was his biggest supporter that he continue the mission. What a couple they are. And then to hear her describe what she has had to go through. She was really athletic. She rode horses. and she rode motorcycles. She hiked up and down the Grand Canyon. She was very physically fit and vigorous. an outdoors woman. In that moment when she was shot. the question was whether she was going to live. She dida blessing for her. for us. for America. and her family. But her life then required her to face incredible challengeshow to learn things that we now take for granted. She describes: I spent the last 3 years learning how to talk again. how to walk again. I had to learn to sign my name with my left hand. It is gritty. painful. frustrating work every day. And rehab is endlessly repetitive. It is never easy because once you have mastered some movement or action or word. no matter how small. you move on to the next. You never rest. What Gabby did. that was the life that was in front of her. and she had to make a decision about whether to engage and plunge forward. knowing how hard that would be. how repetitive that would be. and she did it. Of course. she has been making progress. incredible progress. and she celebrates in this oped that she didnt image that her stricken. paralyzed arm would ever move again. For so many days it did not. until one day it did. So she faces life and embraces this new life that is nothing compared to that athletic. horseriding. motorcycleriding. and Grand Canyon climbing person that was very easy for her to be. She had all of that. those personal qualities with this enormous commitment to public life and had a belief that what we did to try to shape public policy mattered. How you treated the person in your life. the ones you love. incredibly important. but how you use that love to try to build laws that create opportunities for a better. less violent. more peaceful society. She had the energy and the heart to do that as well. And she is continuing that with her cause. working side by side with her husband. Mark. for sensible gun legislation. You know. when I think about what she has done. and. sure. we can have a legitimate debate about what is the right law. I definitely think the background checks. why wouldnt we have that apply to everybody. It doesnt restrict their ability. it just means they go through the check. When I consider that and think. all right. there are legitimate debates on both sides. and the Second Amendment is extremely important and we are all supporters of it. but what is the problem with Congress voting on it. Why is it that we cant summon the will to simply put on the floor for a debate and then a vote where each one of us says ""yes"" or ""no"" on that proposed legislation. background check. and let Americans then decide what they think of us. whether they agree with us or they dont. You know. at a certain point. it is just a question of whether we will do our job. and doing our job is debating the major issues of the time that are of concern to the people of this country. and then standing and voting ""yes"" or ""no... I say we owe that to Gabby. Gabby wouldnt see it that way. She would say that we owe it to ourselves to take on the responsibility that we sought when we ran for public office and took on the privilege of representing the people who sent us here. So I say thank you to Gabby for all she has done. and I challenge us to try to do a little bit of what Gabby would do if she were here to help us today."
1130077175,Well. I will just close briefly. I dont believe we have any other speakers. Again. there are several things here: One is the wisdom of an energy efficiency policy. less is more. and whether you are consuming oil or solar. if you use less. you are going to save money. It is good for the bottom line. Second. any energy efficiency means that we are going to keep in the ground for future use any other fuels that we may need down the road. Third. any energy efficiency requires implementation of energy efficiency retrofits. That is local labor. good jobs. and the use of locally manufactured products. Fourth. energy efficiency means that we do not have to build more generating capacity in order to generate. That saves money. Fifth. what it does is it cuts down on carbon emissions. It is all a really good thing. Then finally. several speakers have referred to Congress. and we all know we have had our challenges here. and it is a function. to some extent. of real debates among the American people that we reflect to some extent. We cant get out of our own way sometimes with some of our rules. But what we know is that. at the end the day. this institution has to be a problemsolving institution that works for the American people. And what we have done here. with Mr. UPTON and Mr. WHITFIELD being the leaders with the responsible positions. is focused on areas where we agree. And they are meaningful areas. It is not a splitthedifference type of deal where we have just shaved so much off that it really is not significant. What we have done is put aside areas where we have real disagreement and havent reached consensus and then doubled down on that area of efficiency where there is common ground. We have taken good ideas. whether they have been offered by a Republican or a Democrat. and we have kept disciplined to have this legislation be about efficiency and a policy that is going to work for the American people. and we havent turned it. either side. into a political Christmas tree that allows us to make some extraneous points. In my view. I think we need to do more of that. I was very heartened in Congress when we had a budget agreement that was reached with the leadership of PAUL RYAN in the House and Senator MURRAY in the Senate. I was happy we had an appropriations bill that did reflect a lot of giveandtake on both sides. and I was very pleased we had a farm bill. Again. lots of things to debate in that farm bill. but we need a 5year farm bill for the people. And now. on energy. we finally pass something that both sides can legitimately be proud of because it is real policy. It is important policy that is going to be beneficial to the bottom line to the American people. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130099738,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague. Mr. MEADOWS. You spoke very well and eloquently about how Vermonters are very proud of Thaddeus Stevens. You gave so much of his biography that I am going to just embrace what you said. but I am going to give you one pronunciation hint: it is Peacham. Vermont. We are going to bring you up there and show you where Thaddeus Stevens was born. Again. thank you so much for your very gracious remarks about Thaddeus Stevens. We in Vermont are very proud of him. as I think Americans are. for many reasons. Vermont was the 14th State. We were the first State that banned slavery in its constitution. We were also the first independent republic that had become part of the Union. Thaddeus Stevens. we would like to think. carried on what was a Vermont conviction about the freedom of men and women. regardless of race. That conviction was to fight against slavery throughout the most tumultuous times of our republic: the years going up to the Civil War. the years during the Civil War. and then the postCivil War Reconstruction period. Some of the most important contributions by the United States Congress occurred after the Civil War. with the passage of. among other things. the 14th Amendment. Thaddeus Stevens was a leading proponent of that 14th Amendment that guaranteed due process of law to all of our citizens. regardless of race. This has been extremely important in our Constitution. Thaddeus Stevens was a selfmade person. He went to a local school. He attended Dartmouth and then went to Pennsylvania to make his mark. He becomes a State legislator. He was elected to Congress in one party. but he later changed. He began in the AntiMasonic Party. later changed to the Whig Party. and then eventually joined the Republican Party. All the while. he was guided by a conviction that all men and women are created equal. That is the test that each of us faces: How can we bring to life that constitutional commitment that all of us have embraced? I would like to thank Senator SANDERS for his leadership in working with the Danville community to draft this bill. Senator SANDERS was also a transplant from Brooklyn. New York. He lived in the Danville area. He has been a lifelong admirer of Thaddeus Stevens. Senator LEAHY. of course. was also a steadfast supporter in the Senate. Mr. Speaker. I urge the passage of this bill to acknowledge Thaddeus Stevens public service and the steadfast dedication that his life represents to the equality of our citizens. regardless of race. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130106690,I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker. the hallmark of a great country is a great infrastructure. In its infancy. this country built interstate canals that helped commerce and life become strong and our economy vigorous. In the height of the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln met with Justin Morrill. then a Senator from the State of Vermont. and conceived the ambition of an intercontinental railroad. In the 1950s. President Dwight D. Eisenhower said that we needed an interstate highway system. This temporary bill. where our only responsibility is to make sure we can preserve what we have by having the funds necessary to repair roads and bridges is an abdication of our responsibility. Congress can do better. and America needs better. Our bridges and our roads are falling apart. I recently visited two projects in Vermont that are in desperate need of repair. but this bill provides temporary funding for 8 months. Not only that. instead of basing it on user fees. which have always been the way we funded infrastructure projects that we all benefit by. it raids pension funds. It essentially creates a pothole in future pensions to fill potholes in our highways. Some folks are saying that we need time in order to put together a longterm bill. Madam Speaker. we have had time. What we need is a decision. There are options out there. As the gentleman from Colorado said. we are not lacking options. what we are lacking is will. This has traditionally been an area of common agreement between Republicans and Democrats where. yes. it is always difficult to figure out what that revenue source is. but that difficulty is not an excuse for Congress to fail to do its job and give this highway trust fund a sustainable and longterm revenue source so that folks in Montpelier and folks in Austin. Texas. can put together those plans to repair our roads and bridges. put America back to work. and get this economy going. I urge us to defeat this rule and to defeat this bill and for Congress finally to do its job.
1130116464,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 2569. the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. That bill would designate those two rivers as Wild and Scenic. We are pretty excited about this in northern Vermont. As has been said. any landowner along the way is going to give permission in order for it to be part of it. Also. before this even was brought to a legislative committee. town meetings in all of the towns along the designation area had discussions in their town halls and. at town meeting. voted and requested that this designation be given. So what we have to show that there really is excitement about this in Vermont is a town vote. and then we have got it built into the legislation that the landowner who is directly affected has to give permission. So those are good safeguards. and as the chairman said. it means that there is no Federal coercion. It is a reflection of local desire. So thank you for that. These rivers are really beautiful. I hope in your time off. Mr. Chairman. when you dont have the burden of this committee and this duty. you might come on up and take a look. As Mr. GRIJALVA said. these rivers flow through beautiful farm fields and valley floors in northern Vermont. They go under covered bridges and through small villages on the way to Lake Champlain. and they have served in Vermont as important routes of early trade. sources of water and food for local farming communities. and sites for some of the best recreational opportunities in the country. The community members just love these rivers. They enjoy the recreational activity they provide. especially canoeing and kayaking. There is a lot of fishing and hunting. swimming and hiking. wildlife viewing. It is a place where folks bring their kids. teach them how to swim. teach them about nature. teach them about fishing. So they also connect up to a canoe trail that spans the entire northern New England States. Having that web of rivers that flow one to the other accessible is enhanced with this legislation. The Wild and Scenic designation. as has been mentioned. would recognize that these waterways do have exceptional recreational value. something that local proponents have known since they undertook the designation process 5 years ago. And the folks involvedit is local farmers. town leaders. river enthusiaststhey have all had to work together. and they have had to talk and knock on doors to the folks who own property along the river. As I mentioned. voters in eight towns within the designation area strongly affirm the plan for their towns participation in the Wild and Scenic Rivers program. This designation is Vermontbased and locally grown. It requires no Federal land acquisition or management. It relies on those local and State and regional partnerships. I want to thank the folks who have helped Mr. BISHOP. the chair of the subcommittee. Thank you so much for your work on this and for putting up with my pestering requests. Ranking Member DEFAZIO. thank you very much for hanging in there. Mr. GRIJALVA. thank you. But I also want to especially thank. on behalf of the State of Vermont. the citizens of Berkshire. Enosburg. Enosburg Falls. Montgomery. Richford. Troy. North Troy. and Westfield. They worked hard in this. and it means a lot to them. Finally. Mr. Speaker. I hope I am not violating any rule of the House. but I want to say something personal about the man from Washington. my former colleague on the Rules Committee. I am going to accuse him of being a good guy. He worked hard on the Rules Committee when I was there. He worked hard in his responsibility as chairman of this committee. You have worked hard for many years serving the people of your district and the people of this country over all your years in Congress. and I want to thank you that one of your last acts is a generous shepherding of this legislation that means so much to the folks in northern Vermont.
1130123028,"I thank the gentlelady. Mr. Speaker. I just want to reiterate what Mr. SESSIONS said. and thank you for your tremendous service here in this body. So thank you for acknowledging that too. Mr. Speaker. Congress is broken. We know it. and the American people know it. The difference between us and them is that we can actually do something about it. In fact. that is our job. But here we go again. ducking our responsibility and not doing our job. We ducked when we failed to pass a longterm transportation bill. We ducked when we failed to meet our constitutional responsibility to debate a new. longterm military commitment in the Middle East. And now. here we go again with this tax extender bill. We need tax reform. 435 Members of Congress agree. Both parties agree. This year we had an opportunity. The Ways and Means Committee. under Chairman DAVE CAMP. presented a real plan. real simplification and lower rates. and all of it was paid for. There were many points of disagreement. as well as agreement in that bill. In a functioning legislature. we would have debated the Camp bill. modified it. and passed some version of it to move America forward. Instead. Speaker BOEHNER said the Camp bill was dead on arrival. No discussion. no debate. no progress. More ducking and dodging instead of Congress doing its job. This tax extender package adds insult to the American people who want tax reform to the injury Congress inflicts by failing to do its job. When we pass tax extenders instead of tax reform. Congress. once again. is back to doing business as usual. This bill. considered on December 3. is retroactive to January. How can we expect businesses and families to plan when we dont let them know what the rules for the tax year are until the year is nearly over? It is business as usual when we preach fiscal responsibility. pledging allegiance to a balanced budget. and then pass a bill which adds $44.7 billion to the taxpayers credit card. Mr. Speaker. how can Congress assert today that we will do tax reform next year. tax reform that the American people are demanding. when we are about to repeat the irresponsible practice of passing shortterm. retroactive bills. something Congress has been doing year in and year out? This bill says to the American people that Congress is up to its old tricks. Meet the new Congresssame as the old Congress. Congress says one thing: ""We need tax reform."" but Congress does another. kicks the can down the road. Mr. Speaker. I do support some of the provisions in this bill and I would like to vote for them. but Congress must do its job. not dodge its responsibilities. Mr. Speaker. I urge a ""no"" vote."

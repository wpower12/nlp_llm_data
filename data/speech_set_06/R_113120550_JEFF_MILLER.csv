1130023227,I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also thank my friend. Mr. SCOTT. for his kind words. I also want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS and Subcommittee Chairman CAMPBELL. with his Ranking Member CLAY. all the members of the Financial Services Committee and the House leadership for their support in bringing to the floor here today H.R. 324. It is a bill that grants the Congressional Gold Medal to the members of the First Special Service Force. I also want to thank the members of the First Special Service Force Association. specifically Mr. Bill Woon for his advocacy. and for the associations efforts in continuing to spread the inspirational story of a truly heroic group of American and Canadian servicemen. I would be remiss not to thank Congressman AL GREEN of Texas and Congresswoman DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ of Florida for encouraging support from their caucus members for this broad bipartisan piece of legislation. and the 324 Members of this body who have cosponsored the bill. I join my colleagues today in support of a bill that bestows upon the First Special Service Force the Congressional Gold Medal. Its Congress highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievement and contributions for their superior service during World War II. The First Special Service Force was a covert World War II military unit born through the efforts of President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The Force conducted ultrahighrisk military missions in Italy and in France. Once sent into action. the First Special Service Force never failed a combat mission. The First Special Service Force achieved remarkable success in battle and contributed prominently in the liberation of Italy and France. Most notably. the Force conducted battles south of Cassino. including Monte La Difensa and Monte Majo. two mountain peaks critical to the German defensive line. During the night of December 3. 1943. the Force ascended to the top of the precipitous face of Monte La Difensa. where the Force suffered heavy casualties and overcame fierce resistance to overtake the German line. The First Special Service Force lost a total of 2.314 men. which was 134 percent of the original combat force. These heroic servicemen represent the breadth of intrepidity and courage. and they have earned our countrys deepest gratitude and highest praise. Though many of the brave troops of the First Special Service Force have been lost to us. this gold medal is an important step in immortalizing their service and honoring the forefathers of todays Special Forces. With just 6 days remaining until Memorial Day. I cannot think of a more appropriate way to honor the heroism and sacrifice of the warriors of the First Special Service Force. and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. To all of the men and women who have guarded our great Nation in the name of protecting and defending liberty that we hold so dear. we say thank you. And to all of those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. may you forever remain in our hearts and in our prayers.
1130057763,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 2481 represents the collective work of our Economic Opportunity Subcommittee. Provisions of this bill streamline eligibility for veterans GI Bill benefits that would ensure that surviving loved ones of servicemembers who die as a result of service have all the educational assistance benefits that they are entitled to and makes improvements to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. I know other Members are here today to speak on provisions of this bill that they have authored. so at this time. I will focus on just a few areas. Sections 4 and 5 of the bill would establish. within existing resources. a Veterans Economic Opportunity Administration at the Department of Veterans Affairs as an Under Secretary to head the effort. The purpose of creating a parallel administration is to serve alongside VAs Veterans Benefits Administration. the Veterans Health Administration. and the National Cemetery Administration. it is to raise in importance the issues affecting veterans readjustment to civilian life. Too often these issues. such as education. job training. and vocational counseling. do not receive the focus that they deserve because they are subsumed within an administration that also has responsibility for disability claims processing. Highlighting and emphasizing the importance of jobs and careers for veterans was an important reason why the Committee on Veterans Affairs created for itself a separate Economic Opportunity Subcommittee several years ago. These provisions would advance the same model within the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is my hope that the new Under Secretary for Economic Opportunity would be a powerful advocate serving veterans readjustment interests. whether at school. during TAP transition classes for departing servicemembers. or as a liaison with the Department of Labors Veterans Employment and Training Service. The second provision I would like to touch on was authored by the late C.W. Bill Young. It would permit the children of certain severely disabled servicemembers. who die shortly after their military service and who have received a Purple Heart. to be eligible for the Fry Educational Scholarship. The Fry Scholarship provides certain post9/11 GI Bill benefits for the children of servicemembers. but only those who die on Active Duty. Chairman Young rightly believed that the kids of those who may have been mortally wounded in service but who died shortly thereafter ought to be eligible for this benefit as well. I am honored to say that section 7 of the bill carries forward Bills provision and that his memory lives on in our work today in this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130065680,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 1471. the Alicia Dawn Koehl Respect for National Cemeteries Act. This bill would grant authority to the Department of Veterans Affairs to reconsider the decision to inter or memorialize an individual within a national cemetery in situations where it is later discovered that the deceased committed a capital crime. Currently. section 2411 of title 38. United States Code. prohibits the interment or memorialization of persons who committed a Federal or State capital crime. Nonetheless. situations have arisen where the entity. such as a funeral home. or the individual who is charged with scheduling the interment or memorialization of a decedent either does not know of the decedents crime or does not truthfully report such crime to Federal cemetery officials. In situations where a funeral home had no knowledge that a decedent was involved in a capital crime at the time of the burial request. VA actually lacks the statutory authority to reconsider interment or memorialization decisions. Simply put. individuals who are buried or memorialized within national cemeteries cannot be disinterred on the basis of subsequently received information. Mr. Speaker. S. 1471 would provide this authority to VA. as well as to the Department of Defense. in the case of Arlington National Cemetery. VA supports this bill. as it would provide the Department with the ability to redress interment cases where eligibility is invalidated by information that is learned after a burial. This bill would also specifically direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to disinter the remains of Michael Lashawn Anderson from Fort Custer National Cemetery. as it was Mr. Anderson who murdered Alicia Dawn Koehl prior to taking his own life. In that case. the funeral home charged with Mr. Andersons burial was unaware of the incident. Thus they did not properly report the crime. and Fort Custer National Cemetery provided the military funeral. The interment of Mr. Anderson was brought to the attention of the Indiana congressional delegation. and I want to thank my colleague from Indiana for highlighting this tragic incident and for offering companion legislation to S. 1471. I also want to thank our colleagues in the Senate for addressing this need and for passing S. 1471. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation. At this time. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130072909,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 357. as amended. is a bipartisan package of legislation that relates to improving employment and training opportunities for Americas veterans. While there are many worthwhile provisions in this bill. I want to focus on section 4 primarily. which deals with instate tuition for veterans. and section 14. which ensures privacy of veterans who are being treated at a VA medical facility. Mr. Speaker. our Nations veterans have always been a source of strength for Americas economy. The post9/11 GI Bill has given thousands of our veterans the opportunity to attend college or receive other types of vocational training at little to no cost to the veteran themselves. Every dollar that we provide in education and training benefits to veterans under the GI Bill goes right back into our economy when these veterans graduate and enter the workforce. I think we can all call that a great investment. However. there are many veterans. through no fault of their own. who are forced to pay exorbitant tuition rates to schools simply because of the transit nature of their military service. and that precludes them from meeting some of the burdensome State residency requirements. Mr. Speaker. as most American families know. the difference between instate versus outofstate tuition at most public schools is immense. According to the College Board. the average instate tuition and fees at public institutions is now $8.655 a year. Outofstate students pay an average of $21.706 per year. Since the post9/11 GI Bill will only pay for tuition and fees at the instate rates at public schools. outofstate student veterans could incur significant debt to make up that difference. I believe that this practice has got to end. The men and women who served this Nation did not just defend the citizens of their own home States. but the citizens of all 50 States. The educational benefits they receive from the taxpayers should reflect the same reality. Mr. Speaker. many States are out in front on this issue. including my home State of Florida. and I applaud the 22 States that currently offer some form of instate tuition to veterans. regardless of their residency. Other State legislatures again. as I said. including my home State of Florida. are currently reviewing legislation to provide this benefit. It is my hope that the House passes this bill. and it will encourage those States to move forward. To that end. section 4 of the bill would require that. in order for public colleges and universities to be eligible to receive payments from a veterans GI Bill benefits. they must enroll these veterans at instate tuition and fee rates. There are important limitations to this requirement. First. States would be permitted to require that student veterans show intent to become fulltime residents of the State in which they are attending school. Secondly. the instate requirement would only apply to veterans who are attending college within 3 years of their discharge from Active Duty. These limitations will ensure that this policy not only targets the population of veterans that are most adversely affected by residency requirements following their military separation. but also fairly recognizes States legitimate interest in subsidizing public education for its taxpaying citizens. Mr. Speaker. I also want to highlight section 14 of the bill. which incorporates the text of a bill that I introduced called the Veterans Privacy Act. In June of 2012. a covert camera disguised as a smoke detector was installed in the room of a braindamaged veteran who was being treated at the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in Tampa. Upon discovering the hidden camera. the veterans family was understandably outraged. When the veterans family asked about the camera. VA officials first stated that the camera did not exist. Then they changed their story and admitted that the ""smoke detector"" was actually a video camera. When further asked if the camera was recording. the VA told the family that the camera was only monitoring the patient. it was not recording. Only after inquiries by local media and the Veterans Affairs Committee did VA admit that the camera was. in fact. recording the patient. VA then removed the camera from the patients room. In the wake of this incident. I sent a letter to VA asking for its legal authority to place a camera in a patients room without their consent. The VA replied that the hidden camera did not violate the law. I am deeply disturbed at VAs actions and response to the privacy interests of this veteran and cant help but wonder whether similar incidents are occurring across the country. That is why I authored this section. which should direct VA to prescribe regulations ensuring that when veterans receive care from VA. their privacy will not be violated by unauthorized video surveillance. Mr. Speaker. as I said. there are many other worthwhile provisions in this bill. and I defer to my colleagues on the floor this afternoon to highlight other remaining provisions. I thank my good friends and the ranking member of the committee. the gentleman from California . and everybody who is here today who are cosponsors of this bill and helping us to move forward. I am also grateful to Leader CANTOR and Speaker BOEHNER for their help in bringing this legislation to the floor. With that. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 357. as amended. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130107477,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the motion to instruct and yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker. while I can appreciate the work that has been done on the other side of this building over in the Senate. I would remind the House that it has been the House committee that has conducted the oversight that has brought this issue to light. The corruption and the arrogance that has taken root at the Department of Veterans Affairs did not. as my colleagues say. did not happen overnight. But I just want to tell my colleagues a little of the history about what brings us here today. From the 9th of June to July 24. the House Committee on Veterans Affairs will have held 12 full committee hearings highlighting the problems that exist at the Department of Veterans Affairs. But beginning with the 112th Congress. the House Committee on Veterans Affairs has held 196 hearings. of which 126 were oversight hearings. and in the 113th Congress alone. we have held 96 hearings to date. We are doing our work. As a result of our work. both the House and the Senate correctly moved to address the problems that exist at the Department. And as is often the case. the bills we pushed through have reflected our good intentions. but there has been a vacuum while waiting for the CBO to score the bills. It is important to remember that the current scandal at VA really entails two issues: timely access to the health care that veterans have earned. and accountability because of the culture of corruption that exists among far too many senior leaders who have put their own welfare ahead of those they are supposed to be serving. The CBO finally provided us with a formal score on the Senate amendment on the 17th of July. Since that time. and even prior to that time. my staff has been in daily contact with our Senate counterparts. and we are making progress on the conference report. There are differences of opinion as to what the final conference report. in fact. is going to say. That is the nature of our work. But to my knowledge. there is no impasse that has been reached at this point. Now. I am confident that the good will on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Hill will present a report that both the House and the Senate can pass before the August recess. so it really makes no sense to take the Senate position on the leases at this time. In fact. some of the provisions in the Senate version are similar to the House bills that have been waiting in the Senate for months. and they could have been sentany one of themon to the President for his signature. That brings me to the specifics of the motion to instruct today. On December 10. 2013. the House passed H.R. 3521 by a vote of 3461. That bill contained provisions to authorize 27 VA communitybased outpatient clinics. It includes the Tulsa. Oklahoma. clinic that my colleague referred to as not being in the Senate bill. And like nearly a dozen other House bills passed in a bipartisan fashion. they are stalled in the Senate. The Senate could pass and send the 27clinic bill that we sent over to them in December today. Mr. Speaker. I must point out that on a total of six different occasions. Senator VITTER from Louisiana and others. both Republican and Democrat. have gone to the Senate floor to request a vote on H.R. 3521 and have been blocked by the Democrats in the Senate. Perhaps the motion to instruct today should be revised to instruct the majority leader of the Senate or others in the Senate Democratic Caucus. Again. Mr. Speaker. we are making progress on the conference report. and to recede at this point to the Senate position would be premature at best. Now. let me spend a few moments talking about the VA budget needs. In each of our annual budget hearings. Members have repeatedly asked the Secretary of the VA: Do you have the resources that you need to get the job done? And every single time. the Secretary has said ""yes."" And now today. suddenly because of the oversight of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. Acting Secretary Gibson testified before the Senate that they will need approximately $17.6 billion in additional resources to meet current demand for the remainder of this year and into 2017. In his testimony. Acting Secretary Gibson stated that about $10 billion of this money would go to purchase care and to hire 10.000 new clinical staff. He further stated that the purchased care would decline over time with a gradual shift back to reliance on internal VA care. He also said about $6 billion would be spent on new infrastructure. So. what the Acting Secretary is saying is. give us billions of more tax dollars to continue reliance upon care that will continue to force veterans to drive. as my colleague has said. in far too many cases hundreds of miles for the care that they have earned. and. oh. by the way. give us billions of more dollars to dump into our construction program that has been shown to be so ineptly managed to result in major projects being on average 35 monthsnot days35 months behind schedule and at least $366 million over cost. Now. again. Mr. Speaker. why would we automatically stand up. salute. and write a check when the inspector general and the GAO have both said we cannot trust VAs numbers on multiple occasions? So the Department. which Rob Nabors describes as having a ""corrosive culture."" now asks for nearly $18 billion. Look. we cant allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue to consider itself a sacred cow above serious oversight on how the already significant resources we provide to the Department have been spent. Decades of a kidglove approach by Congress to holding VA accountable has led us to the issues that confront us today. So I would urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to instruct. At this time. I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida ."
1130107486,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is curious to me that my colleague talks about not waiting. not waiting. not waitingmahiana. The House passed a bill in Decemberin December. How much longer do veterans have to wait before the bill that resides in the Senate is passed? That is what we have been waiting for. I cannot figure out what my colleague has against the veterans in Tulsa. Oklahoma. because that is the clinic that is missing out of the bill that he is wanting to instruct us to accept. Why would we not give access for care to the veterans in Oklahoma? It doesnt make any sense. So when my colleague says maliana. saying that. for some reason. we are trying to delay access to care. I say. oh. nooh. no. What this bill actually does is it expands care way beyond what VA has ever purported to be able to do. The clinics that we are talking about authorizing may not even be necessary in future yearsI am not talking about these specific clinicsbecause veterans will be able to go out into the private sector. No longer will there be a bottleneck within the Department of Veterans Affairs providing access to care for the veterans. You see. that is what has happened with VA really since the 1940s. They have been trying to force veterans to drive for hours to facilities to get their care in places that they dont want to have to get their care at. to get their care when VA says they will get their care. not when the veteran says they want their care. so lets change the formula a little bit. Lets give veterans their care where they want to get it and when they want to get it. So I say to my friend that if we truly want to service the most veterans. you have got to ask the Senate to pass the bill that we passed in December because. for some reason. the Senate doesnt want to put a clinic in Tulsa. Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker. we have no additional speakers at this time. and I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to instruct. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130108003,Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the motion to instruct and yield myself such time as I may consume. As we have already heard. the motion to instruct would require the House to recede to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3230. Solving the problem of timely access to health care and imposing the rule of accountability is absent at VA. and I think that is our first and most important obligation because it is the source of many of the problems that exist within the Department. many of the problems that were uncovered because of the oversight from both Republicans and Democrats on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. We are making good progress with our negotiations with our Senate colleagues. and now is not the time to try to tie the hands of the negotiators with what I believe is a partisan ploy. Moreover. yesterday. Senator SANDERS indicated that he wanted to expand the scope of the conference committees work far beyond what the Senate bill itself had encompassed. by adding VAs request for an additional $17.6 billion into the mix. So today. I say to my colleagues I am not even sure that the Senate could recede to the Senate amendment because they keep moving the goalposts. As I said yesterday. on the last motion to instruct. the inspector general and the GAO have both stated on multiple occasions during our hearings that they do not have confidence in VAs numbers. Moreover. at every VA budget hearing. the Secretary has been asked: Do you have the dollars you need to take care of the veterans that you are tasked with taking care of? Invariably. we get the answer. every single time. yes. So why should we believe that. suddenly. VA sees the need to add an additional $10 billion to hire 10.000 new clinical staff and $6 billion in new construction without having those numbers vetted? When our staff was briefed yesterday on this request for $17.6 billionactually. I dont even know if it is a request yet. but when the Secretary talked about it. they came to brief our staffs. and they brought three sheets of paper to justify a $17.6 billion number. To the Members on both sides of the aisle. I caution that. despite the urgency of the current crisis. we have got to root out the cause that has been affecting timely access to care and accountability. not secondary issues. many of which we all support. including the Fry Scholarship fund expansion. If we dont. those of us fortunate enough to be here years from now will be right back where we are. debating. once again. how things went wrong at the VA. I would point out again. as I did yesterday. there are dozens of bills sitting. languishing in the Senate. including the authorization of 27 clinics. The motion to instruct yesterday talked about receding to the Senate bill that had 26 clinics. The House bill was passed in December of last year27 clinics. If the Senate would just bring it up. pass it. send to it the President. we could immediately make a difference. I also talked about the expansion of the Fry Scholarship program. That is something that we certainly should look at. but it will do nothing. nothing to increase the care and break the backlog. the lines that our veterans are waiting in now to get the health care that they have earned. So I would ask the Senate to pass the dozen bills that sit over there on their side. send them to the President today. and I would also point out that I am willing to discussand I think most Members on our sidethe Fry Scholarship issues. but we dont think that they are in the scope of the emergency that exists today. Part of the reason that I believe that. section 701 of the Senate bill does not address timely access to care or the cultural corruption that exists within the Department. A surviving spouseas my colleague. Mr. BARBER has already saidwho has a spouse that was killed on active duty is already entitled to receive financial benefits that include 45 months of GI Billtype education benefits. $500.000 in death benefits. and $1.215 in monthly dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. In short. I dont believe it is time for us to be talking about expanding the benefits without expressing them through regular order here on the House floor. especially in the face of what I now understand is the Senates new effort to move the goal line in our conference committee work. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130109509,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. and I rise in opposition to the motion to instruct. Mr. Speaker. as I said during the debate last week on other motions to instruct that were brought to the floor. improving timely access to quality health care and imposing true accountability for senior managers are the keys to beginning the long process of restoring trust at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This was the central charge to the conferees that are currently meeting at the beginning of our conference. and it remains the same charge tonight. As I said last week. now is not the time to tie the hands of the conferees with an unnecessary motion on the floor. I know my colleague. Mr. PETERS. has the best of intentions. They are rooted in his desire to serve veterans of this country. but unfortunately. somebody somewhere has different ideas. Veterans expect us to do what is best to improve the quality of care that they receive and the delivery of the benefits that they have earned. I certainly expect that none of these votes that have been takenin fact. I believe we have done four. and another was noticed todaywill be used by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in 30second political ads. By adopting the motion to instruct. we would be telling our conferees to recede to the Senates position on all provisions of the Senate bill. While I am still hopeful that a deal is possible. Senator SANDERS and I and our staffs and other conferees continue to work each day and into the night. It is becoming more difficult. though. because the Senate has once again changed the goalposts. and I dont know what the Senates real position is today. In fact. I said last week I dont know if the Senate could vote for their own bill now. Senator SANDERS has recently indicated his desire to expand the scope of our conference committees work by adding VAs requestand I say ""request."" but I really dont know. Is it an emergency request? Is it a supplemental request? Nobody seems to be sure exactly what it is. Most importantly. the VA doesnt know what it is. Senator SANDERS is asking for the inclusion of an additional $17.6 billion into our conversation. As I said last week. both the VA Office of Inspector General and the General Accountability Office have said on numerous occasions that they do not have any confidence in the numbers that VA provides right now. Moreover. at every budget hearing before our committee in recent years. the Secretary has sat at the witness table and clearly saidwhen asked by members: Do you have the funds necessary?-the Secretary says: We have the funds necessary to meet the needs of our veterans. So why all of a sudden would we believe that VA sees this need for an additional $10 billion to hire 10.000 more health care staff and $6 billion in new construction without thoroughly vetting the numbersalso. add an additional $1.5 billion for ITwhen we already know that VA has squandered hundreds of millions of dollars in IT money over the years? But what I want to do for the Members here tonight is to show you a typical budget submission. a request from the administration on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is over 1.300 pages in four volumes to justify the money that is spent at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Speaker. here is the explanation that was given to us for the $17.6 billion ask by the Department. I have in recent days called it a threepage document-$17.6 billion justified by a threepage documentbut actually. if you take the cover letter off and if you take the closing page off. you have one page to justify $17.6 billion. Now. in talking with Senator SANDERS and Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson on the phone a couple of days ago. I expressed that this was not the way to justify this type of expenditure to this Congress. I believe people on both sides of the aisle will clearly admit that this is not what we would call ""regular order."" but the Acting Secretary said. by noon yesterday. I would receive much more detailed information on this ask. So noon came and it rolled by. and it was at 9 oclock last night when. finally. we got this deep diveadditional informationand they doubled the pages to two pages of information for a $17.6 billion asktwo pages. The Acting Secretary will be before our committee tomorrow morning. I hope he brings three pages with him to justify this request. This is not enough information for such a huge ask by the VA. It is not some unsubstantiated guess put together in the back room of a massive bureaucracy. In fact. interestingly enough. it is titled. ""A Working Estimate."" as of July 22. This isnt even the number that they are sure that they want to ask for. What is really disappointing is that I actually believe that we could have already come to an agreement if Senator SANDERS had not insisted on moving the goalpost and adding this $17.6 billion ask into a clearly defined conference committee. With that. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130110832,Mr. Speaker. I thank my friend. Mr. FRANKS. for yielding. H.J. Res. 105 would bestow honorary American citizenship on General Bernardo de Galvez. Though not born in the United States. General Galvez was a true friend to our country who played an integral role in securing the independence of this Nation. As governor of Spanish Louisiana. General Galvez provided American forces with funds. arms. and ammunition. and he provided military intelligence to the American commanders. After Spains entry into the war. General Galvez recruited an army of American. Spanish. and French troops and set about a multiyear campaign that decimated British forces all along the gulf coast. General Galvez led successful campaigns in Louisiana. Mississippi. and Alabama before embarking on his seminal victory at the Siege of Pensacola. where he captured the capital of British West Florida after a bloody 2month long battle. during which he in fact was wounded by gunfire. General Galvezs victory left the British with no naval forces or bases along the gulf coast and prevented British troops and supplies from reaching the battles along the eastern seaboard. His efforts to assist the formation of our country were recognized by President George Washington. President John Adams. and by the United States Continental Congress. In fact. President Washington cited General Galvezs efforts as a deciding factor in the outcome of the war. Honorary citizenship is a rare and extraordinary recognition granted to foreigners who have rendered great service to the United States of America. Only seven individuals have been granted honorary citizenship. including two Revolutionary War heroes. the Marquis de Lafayette. and General Casimir Pulaski. When our Founding Fathers declared our independence. they knew that they were going up against probably the worlds most preeminent power. They chose to take up that battle because of their unwavering commitment to liberty and freedom. but they also knew that in order to be successful. they needed the support of allies and great men like the Marquis de Lafayette. Casimir Pulaski. and General Bernardo de Galvez. I want to thank Chairman GOODLATTE. Chairman GOWDY. Chairman FRANKS. and the staff of the Judiciary Committee for their assistance in moving this bill through committee. I also want to thank our majority leader for bringing this bill to the floor. I would encourage all my colleagues to support this measure to recognize General Galvezs immense contribution to the history of our country by granting him honorary American citizenship.

1140014296,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 1030. the socalled Secret Science Reform Act. Let me just say first that I am opposed to the bill and the underlying premise that there is not good science. good research. and good data being gathered by the EPA. Unfortunately. this bill would force the EPA to choose between protecting our health and environment and maintaining the privacy of patient medical records and the confidentiality of business records. But my amendment highlights one issue that. to me. makes a mockery of this entire effort. The bill. as written. currently gives the EPA only $1 million per year to carry out the provisions in the bill. It wouldnt be so bad except that the Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of the bill to be $250 million per year to implement the bill. I know. Mr. Chairman. that you perhaps think that you did not hear me correctly. But to put this disparity in some perspective. the Congressional Budget Office is estimating that implementing this bill would cost 25.000 percent more than the majority is providing. Now I understand why the majority is doing this. They dont want to pass legislation that costs anything to implement. It wouldnt be fiscally conservative. Now. I am not a math major. but simple math tells me that if a bill is $1 million in the text but costs $250 million to implement. you are asking the EPA to undertake $250 million of work with $1 millionnot exactly fiscally or legislatively conservative or sound. More importantly. it forces the Agency into an untenable position. They must either ignore the requirements of this legislation because the majority isnt providing them with the resources to carry them out. or they can comply with the requirements forand Mr. Chairman. hold your breaththey could comply with the requirements for 11/2 days. That is what the funding would allow: $1 million. 11/2 days. and then shut down all of the covered actions under the bill. So I know we think it might be laughable. except that it is true. But if the majority really believes in the premise behind this legislation. which I do not. then the majority should provide the Agency with the $250 million annually that. at a minimum. the Agency would need to carry out this bill. Those are not my estimates. Those are the estimates of the independent Congressional Budget Office. I am opposed to the bill for a number of reasons. and most likely. my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would disagree with me on those points. However. I have a hard time believing that any responsible Member of Congress who supports fiscal conservatism would consciously support a bill that is guaranteed. absolutely guaranteed to cause failure. So I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and not allow this bill to move forward with an unfunded mandate to the Agency. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140015493,I thank my friend and colleague from Maryland for his leadership on the Budget Committee. and also the Democrats on the Budget Committee. Mr. Chairman. Congress is really tasked at this time of year with developing a budget that lays out our Nations priorities and spending. but those priorities really should reflect our values. As hard as it is to imagineand it is hardthis Price budget resolution is actually worse than the previous Ryan budget for hardworking American families. Once again. we see how little Republicans value protecting critical priorities that actually help Americans live a healthy life and enjoy a secure retirement. In fact. the Republican budget would force working families to pay more in taxes. It would make college education less affordable. It would force seniors to pay more for their health care and prescription drugs. It would end the Medicare guarantee by turning it into a voucher program. Lastly. Mr. Chairman. it would block grant both Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The fact is that this budget would decimate our Nations already crumbling infrastructure by reducing funding by 19 percent over the next decade. If you would imagine that. that means that every road that needs to be repaired. the bridges that are falling apart. the mass transit that needs investing in. this budget would actually cut our spending by 19 percent over the next decade. It would require an additional $318 billion from Federal and postal employees and their retireeshardworking people who have given all that they can to deficit reduction. In fact. that is a constituency that has already contributed $159 billion to deficit reduction. Mr. Chairman. Republican priorities are making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent. and they are shrinking the size of government. regardless of the damagegreat damagethat it would cause. House Democrats. I believe. are investing in hardworking Americans. We have said it is important for us to improve access to highquality child care and dependent care. It is important to invest in quality education for all our children. It is important to end the draconian acrosstheboard sequester cuts. The Acting CHAIR . The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
1140019746,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H. Con. Res. 25 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service on May 15 and a National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. Both events will be coordinated with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police. The National Peace Officers Memorial will honor law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014. According to preliminary estimates. over 125 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty just this last year. a 24 percent increase over the 102 officers killed in 2013. Firearmsrelated incidents were the leading cause of death among law enforcement officers in 2014. with 50 officers slain by firearms. The second leading cause of death among law enforcement officers was trafficrelated fatalities. with 49 officers killed in that manner. In the State of Maryland. there was one law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty in 2014. Officer Jamel Claggett from the Charles County Sheriffs Office. Mr. Speaker. I know that we are honoring and recognizing peace officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014. but I would like to make a personal note that in the State of Maryland alone. just since the beginning of this year. three officers were killed and one police dog was also killed in the line of duty: Just a couple of weeks ago. Federal Protective Service Officer Lawrence Buckner was killed outside of the Census Bureau on April 9. just a few weeks before that. Prince Georges County Police Officer Brennan Rabain was killed in an automobile accident on March 7. just prior to that. in January. a police officer from Baltimore. Craig Chandler. was also killed in a vehicle accident. a canine. Bella. from the Maryland Division of Correction in Maryland was killed in a fire incident also just a few weeks ago. It is a stark reminder of the jeopardy that officers place themselves in and a reminder of what they do every single day to protect each and every one of us. I have such a deep admiration and appreciation for the fallen officers who will be honored on May 15 and the ultimate sacrifices they have made on behalf of all of our local communities. I urge Members to join me in supporting this tribute to our law enforcement officers across the country who died in the line of duty in 2014. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140024576,"Mr. Chairman. despite nearly universal calls for increased clarity and certainty from certain stakeholders. my colleagues have made it a priority to halt the current clean water rulemaking and to force agencies to go back to the drawing board and start the process all over again. before the public will ever even see the final product. After over a year of public outreach on a scale unprecedented in the history of the Clean Water Act. as well as countless congressional hearings. the agencies have submitted a revised clean water protection rule to the Office of Management and Budget for final interagency review. which is the last step before the revised final rule would be released to the general public later this spring. This. in fact. is the basis of my amendment. You see. Mr. Chairman. to be fair. several of my constituents have expressed similar concerns with the substance of the proposed rule. In fact. Maryland farmers have visited with me on more than one occasion. and I have heard those concerns. and that is why I have pressed the agency witnesses who appeared before our subcommittees on several critical areas. Indeed. in testimony to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. the heads of both the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency have identified several specific areas where the proposed rulemaking may have lacked specificity and where the agencies have committed to clarifying changes in the final rule to address these areas. For example. the American Farm Bureau and Maryland farmers expressed concern about the distinction between ephemeralthat is raindependentstreams. which are currently subject to the Clean Water Act. and erosional features. which are not. EPA has testified that the agencies expect the final rule to clarify the distinction between ephemeral streams and erosional features to ensure that the final rule does not inadvertently bring erosional features under the scope of the act. Numerous groups. including the National Association of Counties. have expressed concern about the impact of the proposed rule on ""ditches."" In response. the agencies testified that the proposed rule not only codified the current exemption for ditches but also ""expanded the definition of ditches that would be exempt under the clean water rule to make it clearer. [including] ditches that basically drain dry along public lands and highways."" Further. the agencies committed to provide greater certainty in the final rule on what ditches are and are not protected by the act. Other groups questioned whether the proposed clean water rule would capture municipal separate sanitary storm water sewer systems. that is. MS4s. or water reuse and recycling projects. The EPA Administrator testified before our committee that ""EPA has not intended to capture features . . . that have already been captured in . . . MS4 permits. [and it] is our intent to continue to encourage and respect those decisions and to encourage water reuse and recycling. which very much is consistent with the Clean Water Act and our overall intent."" Further. the Administrator testified that the EPA would make it very clear that these exclusions are articulated in the final rule. ""so that people will see in writing what they have been asking us about."" So my amendment simply addresses these concerns and claims. It says that if any of these claims prove to be true. then the Secretary and the Administrator are prohibited from issuing any final rule that would bring about these occurrences. Instead of using a legislative scalpel. my Republican colleagues have decided to use a meat cleaver. In my amendment. I have tried to address these concerns. and I have heard from my constituents and interested parties. Under the amendment. the administration cannot expand the scope beyond those water bodies covered prior to the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in the two cases that have been mentioned before. and it cannot be inconsistent with either Justice Scalias or Justice Kennedys judicial opinions in Rapanos. In addition to that. they cant increase the regulation of ditches. they cant eliminate any historical statutory or regulatory exemptions for agriculture. which do not exist under the 2003 and 2008 documents. There are questions about ditches under the 2003 and 2008 guidance. but they are interpreted differently in different parts of the country. As a fallback and an assurance to the regulated committee. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment so that clear legislative restrictions on the final rulemaking addressing the range of concerns that have been expressed by stakeholders are included. It will ensure that the rule does not go further than the Supreme Court decision and does not exceed historical scope. while reaffirming longstanding and existing exclusions. Both agencies have made it crystal clear in their testimony before our committee and other committees of the House and the Senate earlier this year in a joint hearing with the Senate that many of these concerns were unfounded or would be addressed in the final rule. and so what the amendment I am offering would do. it would be a backstop in the unlikely event that anyone would think differently about regulating streams. ditches. and farmland. I would ask for support of my amendment under the rule. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140028513,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I am offering this substitute amendment because I think we have a unique opportunity this week to pass bipartisan commercial space legislation that actually stands a chance of becoming law. That is what we need to focus on this morning. The choice before us is really quite straightforward. We can spend the morning. as we have. fighting over the provisions of H.R. 2262. several of which were opposed by all of the Democratic members of the Science. Space. and Technology Committee when its provisions were marked up just last week. And when we are done. Members can vote. largely on party lines. to pass the bill. But to what end. Mr. Chairman? The Senate has already made it clear that H.R. 2262 has the proverbial snowballs chance of being adopted by the Senate. Pursuing House legislation. House passage of a bill that is going nowhere in the Senate seems to me to be the ultimate exercise in futility. and one that does a real disservice to the commercial space launch industry that all of us are trying to help succeed. But we dont have to go down that path. My amendment would replace the underlying text of H.R. 2262 with provisions of the bipartisan Senate commercial space bill. the one that was marked up in committee just yesterday. Let me repeat that. The language in the substitute amendment. in my amendment. already has garnered bipartisan support in the Senate. It is language that is cosponsored by Senators TED CRUZ. BILL NELSON. CORY GARDNER. and GARY PETERS. which is not something you can say about many other bills that we consider in the House. Now. the Senate bill doesnt have everything I would like to see in a commercial space bill. I am sure that is the same for my Republican colleagues and for some in the industry. That is actually how legislation is made. However. it has a core set of provisions that I think we and the industry can support. and that is what good compromises are all about. The amendment addresses key issues facing the industry. It extends the ""learning period"" for another 5 years. It extends thirdparty liability and indemnification of the entire regime for another 4 years. It provides commercial space launch licensing and experimental permit flexibility. It provides a NASAsought definition of ""Government Astronaut"" and provides a path for streamlining commercial space launch activities. The Senate provisions also provide for a review of issues related to commercial activities in space. as well as matters related to space situational awareness data. They provide encouragement for the FAA and the industry to work together to facilitate the development of voluntary consensus standards. and they also ensure the International Space Station can remain a viable and productive facility through 2024. Mr. Chairman. that is what my amendment does. It doesnt give the commercial space industry anything or everything that some in the industry might want. But I would remind colleagues that the Senate bill has been endorsed by the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. the National Space Society. Students for Exploration and Development of Space. SpaceX. Blue Origin. and Virgin Galactic. among others. That is the Senate bill. That is the substitute that is being offered. So Members today can feel perfectly comfortable that my amendment is one that the commercial space industry believes meets its legitimate needs. Mr. Chairman. as I said in the beginning of my remarks. we have a clear choice today. We can maintain a counterproductive. partisan divide and hold out for provisions that wont move this legislation even 1 inch closer to becoming law. Or we can step back. take a deep breath. and embrace the bipartisan compromise that our colleagues in the Senate have worked out. They have handed us a golden opportunity to move past partisan posturing and actually deliver legislation that can meet the needs of the commercial space industry and be enacted into law. Mr. Chairman. House Democrats support the provisions of my amendment. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate support the provisions of my amendment. If my Republican colleagues here today in the House can join us in supporting this substitute amendment. the provisions in the amendment. we can pass bipartisan legislation that could be on its way to the President for enactment in a matter of weeks. I can think of no better way to end this week. and I urge Members to vote ""yes"" on the amendment in the nature of a substitute. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140039224,"Mr. Chairman. I rise to offer an amendment to strike section 438. Section 438 would prohibit any funds in this Act from being used to even propose a national ozone standard that is less than that currently in law until at least 85 percent of the counties across the country that do not currently meet that standard achieve full compliance. Now. the current ozone standard under title 40 is 75 parts per billion. but. Mr. Chair. we had a series of hearings in our House Science Committee earlier this year where we heard strong testimony from scientists at State pollution control agencies and physicians at hospitals all telling us that the current standard is not in line with the current science. The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee declared as far back as 2008 that they believe that the current standard of 75 parts per billion is insufficient to protect public health. In fact. right now. the ozone standard can mislead people to believe that the air. in fact. is safe to breathe when it is not. Studies conducted by the American Lung Association have shown more than 4 out of every 10 people in the United States live in places where ozone levels often make it dangerous to breathe. The current standard rates. what we now know to be very dangerous air quality. as code yellow or moderate. This can lead those who are particularly at risk of ozonerelated illness. such as children and senior citizens. to unwittingly be exposed to harmful levels of ozone. This has the potential to impact millions of people in every State across the Nation. Just look at my own home State of Maryland. There are 145.000 children with pediatric asthma. Over 430.000 adults have asthma. Mr. Chairman. 246.000 people in my State have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. and 367.000 people in our State have cardiovascular disease that is related to ozone. The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee recommends that. in order to protect the public health. the EPA set the primary ozone standard between 60 and 70 parts per billion. In November of last year. the EPA did exactly what it is supposed to do. It looked at the strong scientific evidence showing the health risks of ozone. and it issued a proposed rule to lower the ozone standard from 75 parts per billion to a standard within the range of 65 to 70 parts per billion. Setting that standard begins a 2year process designed to identify areas with too much ozone. Once those areas are identified. State and local governments can craft plans tailored to their areas using costeffective approaches. This new standard. based on the most current science. will help to provide a framework for these plans. which. in turn. will help our States continue along the path to clean air. And yet. here we are. and this provision that I am providing to strike would stop the EPA from even proposing a standard of 70 parts per billion. This is the responsibility of the EPA. This new standard would protect Americans health and our environment. In addition. an analysis conducted by the EPA shows that. though the annual cost of the proposed standard of 70 parts per billion might be around $3.9 billion. the health benefits are estimated to reach between $6.4 billion and $13 billion annually. Mr. Chairman. ground level ozone is harmful to the public health. It contributes to asthma attacks. decreased lung function. respiratory infection. and even death. Breathing ozone is dangerous for everyone. but particularly for children. for the elderly and people of all ages who have lung diseases. We need to allow the EPAin fact. empower the EPAto follow the science and create minimum standards necessary to protect public health. I urge my colleagues to protect these vulnerable populations as well as clean air for every American. and vote ""yes"" on this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140046024,Mr. Chairman. this Young amendment looks eerily familiar to the socalled Secret Science Reform Act. H.R. 1030. that the House passed in a partisan vote back in March. except the problem is that this bill is actually even worse. H.R. 1030 would have applied these harmful restrictions to the EPA. but this amendment that we are looking at today would affect every single Federal agency. Lets look. The amendment would require an agency. as part of its rulemaking process. to make all information used in the creation of a rule publicly accessible. including all of the data. That would mean that any data that is considered confidential. such as health information or business records. would most likely become off limits. So. for example. an agency trying to create labeling requirements for toxic chemicals wouldnt be able to use a study that uses personal health data as long as that data is deemed confidential. New scientific methods and data could be restricted because the information includes data protected by intellectual property laws. When we passed the Secret Science Act on a partisan vote last March. I mentioned in my opposition that it would force the EPA to choose between protecting our health and environment and maintaining the privacy of patient medical records and the confidentiality of business records. And if that argument isnt enough. lets consider the costs. When the House Science Committee was considering the bill that I mentioned previously. the Secret Science Act that does exactly the same thing that the Young amendment does. except to all Federal agencies. Democrats on the committee pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office estimated just for that one bill that it would cost the EPA $250 million to comply with the new regulations. If that is how much it is going to cost the EPA for one regulatory requirement. imagine what the cost would be if you expand this mandate across every single Federal agency. The cost would be astronomical. Between the cost and the harmful restrictions that this imposes on our Federal agencies. the amendment sets up an impossible hurdle for those agencies to overcome. We are asking them to decide between compromising institutional review board ethics and doing their job to protect the American people. It is very clear that the Young amendment and provisions like it are not. in fact. about transparency. It really is to block Federal agencies from doing their jobs. their jobs of protecting our air. giving us clean water. making sure that our food supply is safe. checking on medical devices so that they dont harm us. our prescription drugs so that they dont make us sick. our privacy safeguards for our workplace information. our workplace safety standards. protections against Wall Street and its predatory lending practices. I would ask my colleagues to oppose this harmful and antiscience amendment. oppose the final bill. and oppose this amendment because of the restrictions that it would place on the American people. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia
1140054621,"Mr. Speaker. in 280 days. Maryland has lost 301 lives to gun violence.

1140102898,"Mr. Speaker. our Nation is still horrified and heartbroken over the brutal act of terror and hate that killed 49 and wounded many more in Orlando. Florida. just over a week ago. We stand in solidarity with the loved ones of those who were lost. with the LGBT community that suffered this unimaginable act of violence. and the entire Orlando community as they work to move forward from this tragedy. We can work together to disarm hate. Gun violence has become unacceptably commonplace in the country. The Orlando attack is only the latest and the most deadly mass shooting in the history of the United States. We have a responsibility to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands. But. Mr. Speaker. it is not just mass shootings that should be our focus. Guns have taken more lives in this country since 1968 than were lost in all the wars this Nation has ever fought. On average. more than 89 people each day die due to gun violence. whether that is by homicide. suicide. or accident. That is more than 33.000 Americans being killed by guns each year. In just over the 3 years since Newtown. more than 111.300 people have been killed by someone using a gun in America. In my State of Maryland. in 2015 alone. more than 340 Marylanders have lost their lives to homicide by guns. Yet. despite the national consensus for legislation to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and convicted felons and domestic abusers. a vocal minority. led by the National Rifle Association. stands in the way of commonsense proposals to keep our Nation safer. Those voices are forcing a false choice between constitutional rights and safe streets. We can do both. Congress can and must enact laws that improve the public safety while respecting the Constitution. This Congress has no right to hold moments of silence anymore and then do nothing to prevent the next tragedy. This is a moment of truth for Congress. We cannot have another moment of silence without action. We can and should expand and strengthen our background checks and pass the bipartisan no fly. no buy bill to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. So today what we know is that across this country there are people who go to unlicensed dealers at gun shows and do what they could not do if they went to Walmart to get a gun. and that is to get one without passing a background check. These unlicensed dealers are a significant source of crimes in my State and across the country. with an estimate of 40 percent of all purchases made through them without a background check. Studies show that background checks actually do stop 170 felons. 50 domestic abusers. and 20 fugitives every single day from buying weapons. It works when you do it. Recent polling shows that universal background checks are universally supported across the political spectrum. A CBS poll released just last week showed that 89 percent of the public supports legislation requiring background checksthe lowhanging fruit. the common denominatorand that includes 97 percent of Democrats. 92 percent of Republicans. and 82 percent of Independents. Who is left out? The vocal minority led by the National Rifle Association. Lets talk about the National Rifle Association. Mr. Speaker. because they actually used to support universal background checks at gun shows. On May 27. 1999. Wayne LaPierre. the current executive president and CEO of the National Rifle Association. testified before the House Judiciary Committee about 1 month before Columbine. in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered. He said this: ""We think its reasonable to provide mandatory instant background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone."" That is a direct quote from Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association. When did they change? When it became politically expedient to do the job of the gun industry. So. unfortunately. they have flipped their position. They no longer support expanded background checks. and they have worked to prohibit that action here in Congress. So I will say. Mr. Speaker. to Speaker RYAN and to my Republican colleagues: Enough already. We are tired. We are done. It is past time for the Congress to listen to the American public instead of to the National Rifle Association. to listen to the overwhelming number of Democrats. Republicans. and Independents. and to take guns out of the hands of terrorists. convicted felons. and those who would do harm to others. No bill. no break. It is time to disarm hate."

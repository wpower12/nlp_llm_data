1130033431,Mr. Speaker. in 5 days. the student loan interest rate will double. It will go from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. That is a $4.500 increase for many college students. At a time when theyre struggling to make ends meet. struggling to pay their tuition and their housing expenses to prepare to join the workforce and build careers and at a time when theyre struggling to pay their debts. were going to increase their debt. I want to commend to my colleagues a report that just came out from the Joint Economic Committee staff that talks about how student loan debt has skyrocketed over the past several years. Heres how the study concludes: The increasing debt burden presents challenges for recent graduates just beginning their careers and poses a potential risk to the economy. since individuals who shoulder heavier debt balances may delay purchasing a home. buying a car. starting a family. and saving for retirement. On average. recent graduates left college with student loan debt of 60 percent of their annual income. Mr. Speaker. 60 percent of their annual income will be spent paying back their debts from college. And if we dont compromise. its going to be even more than that. Ive always believed. and I know many of my colleagues have always believed. that you build an economy by building the middle class. And you expand the middle class by making sure that middle class families can afford college and that college is accessible. I do not understand an economic strategy that says that you make it harder and more expensive for the middle class to go to college. nor do I understand an argument that we cannot afford to keep the interest rate low. but we can spend $40 billion subsidizing the five richest oil companies in America who do not need those subsidies. The middle class deserves those subsidies. Middle class students trying to get into college deserve subsidies. But to say that they cannot have those subsidies and that were going to double the interest rate on them while preserving a $40 billion subsidy to the richest oil companies on Earth is not only bad policy. its ruinous economic strategy. Mr. Speaker. I do not know why anybody in this body would want to make it harder and more difficult for students to go to college at a time when we are competing with China and South Korea and other countries around the world to continue our strength and power over the next several decades. It is essential that we find a compromise. Mr. Speaker. There is an unquenchable thirst by Americans for compromise in this body. I. for one. as well as members of the House Democratic Caucus. am ready. willing. and able to compromise over the next 5 days. We just need somebody to compromise with. We need a compromise that is fair to the middle class. puts middle class families first. puts college students first. puts college affordability first. and puts partisan politics aside.
1130049948,"I thank the distinguished ranking member. Mr. Speaker. for people who are tuning in to this debate. I want to make sure there is no confusion. This is not ""Saturday Night Live."" This is the Republican majority at work. Only they are not workingit is a game. It is a game that they have played since day one. This has been the Congress of chronic chaos since day one. and tonight is just another episode. my colleagues. of that Congress of chronic chaos. Forget ""Saturday Night Live."" Mr. Speaker. When I grew up on Long Island. I used to watch one of my favorite cartoons. the ""Road Runner."" Do you remember the ""Road Runner."" Mr. Speaker? In every episode. another cliff. They have turned governing into an old cartoon of the ""Road Runner."" This is not a game. The American people deserve better than this. This is not about the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Speaker. This is not about ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker. This is about whether we govern. This is about whether they are willing to hold this economy hostage to their ideology. This is about whether they are willing to put people out of work because of their extremismand they use the Affordable Care Act as a subterfuge. Mitt Romney said theyre going too far. Karl Rove said theyre going too far. The Chamber of Commerce said theyre going too far. The Wall Street Journal said theyre going too far. And what are they doing tonight? Going farther. Theyre doubling down. The American people have gone from deep disappointment in this dysfunctional majority to absolute outrage with this dysfunctional majority. Mr. Speaker. the American people who are watching this and watching this Congress want reasonable leaders with reasonable solutions and commonsense ideas for this country. not shutdowns. not showdowns. not cliffs. not chaos. not cartoons. which we get tonight and which we have gotten every single night since this majority became the majority. When this government shuts down because of them. Mr. Speaker. Americans are going to have to continue to pay their taxes."
1130084845,Mr. Chairman. my amendment is very simple. It would direct the CBO to analyze the impact of our major bills here in Congress on some of the Nations most critical institutions. our State and local governments. and State and local taxpayers. The State Budget Crisis Task Force is cochaired by former Lieutenant Governor of the State of New York Richard Ravitch and the former Federal Reserve Board Chair Paul Volcker. They spent a great deal of time analyzing the impacts of what we do here on State and local governments and taxpayers. What did they find? They found that fiscal stress runs downhill. and very often. local taxpayers are the recipient of that stress. Everything we do here in Congress. Mr. Chairman. or everything that we dont do has significant implications on broader levels of government and local taxpayers. But no mechanism exists at all to assess the fiscal impact of Federal actions on those taxpayers. I am offering this amendment today because if we are going to analyze how our fiscal actions affect the economy. we need to make sure we are not just pushing off the hard decisions to local taxpayers. Let me give you an example. The Republican budget. offered by my good friend. the gentleman from Wisconsin. cuts over $50 billion from road repair and infrastructure investments. And so the implication of that budget is that the Federal Government does less but local taxpayers have to pay the bill to fill in the potholes. That is just fundamentally wrong. That is a wrong priority. We have to stop staying in this position where we are cutting taxes and spending here only to increase taxes and spending in our local communities. We cant keep pushing off these costs and the accompanying uncertainty surrounding this funding. That is why my amendment is so important. Mr. Chairman. It would tell us if we are actually being fiscally responsible at all levels. or are we simply moving costs from one level of government to the other? I hope my friends will support this amendment. We all represent not just Federal taxpayers but local taxpayers. and we should protect the interests of both. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130100263,Mr. Chairman. I rise to engage in a colloquy with Ranking Member VISCLOSKY and Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN. But first I would like to commend the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership on this bill. I am here today to address the importance of delivering the utmost care to our brave servicemen and -women who suffer from mental health disorders. and the benefits that publicprivate partnerships between the Department of Defense and teaching hospitals can provide. specifically to members of the National Guard and Reserve components who return from tours of duty and transition into civilian life far from a military base and without easy access to the care that they need. I am pleased that the Department recognizes the benefits of these publicprivate partnerships and created a pilot program to improve efforts to treat members of the National Guard and Reserve components and their families who suffer from mental health disorders. But we must not stop there. It is heartbreaking that preliminary readouts of suicide data for 2013 show that the Active component rate has come down about 18 percent. but the Reserve rates rose slightly. This problem is not going away. That is why I am so pleased that the defense bill included language in the bills report. recommended by the gentleman from New York and me. that encourages the Secretary of Defense to expand this initial pilot to include additional community partners through a competitive and meritbased process. There are a number of teaching and clinical hospitals around the country that specialize in mental health treatment and can make a real difference in addressing the soaring demand for mental health treatment. I would like to work with the chairman and the ranking member to ensure that the Department has the necessary funding to expand this vital pilot program so more of our Nations brave servicemembers are able to receive the best care possible. Mr. Chairman. at this time I am honored to yield to Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN.

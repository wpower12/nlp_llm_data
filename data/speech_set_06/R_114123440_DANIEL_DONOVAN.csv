1140056194,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3493. the Securing the Cities Act of 2015. In April 2010. the President stated: ""The single biggest threat to U.S. security. both shortterm. midterm and longterm. would be the possibility of a terrorist organization obtaining a nuclear weapon."" Since that time. the threat to our cities from nuclear terrorism has not abated. The rise of ISIS and the resurgence of al Qaeda have only increased the likelihood that radiological material will fall into the hands of those who wish to harm America. Just last week. the Associated Press reported that the FBI foiled an attempt by smugglers in Eastern Europe to sell nuclear material to Middle Eastern extremist groups. That report stated that. in the past 5 years. the FBI has disrupted four other attempts by smugglers from the former Soviet Union to sell nuclear materials to criminal organizations. These events only reinforce the testimony delivered before the House Committee on Homeland Security last month by Commissioner William Bratton of the New York City Police Department. In that testimony. the commissioner described the current terrorist threat to Manhattan as the highest it has ever been. and he specifically referenced the danger of illicit nuclear material entering the city. Thankfully. since the attacks of September 11. 2001. this Congress. successive administrations. and local law enforcement have partnered to build the capability to guard against this risk. In particular. the Department of Homeland Security initiated the Securing the Cities program within the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The Securing the Cities program provided training. equipment. and other resources to State and local law enforcement in highrisk urban areas to prevent a terrorist group from carrying out an attack using a radiological or nuclear device. The Securing the Cities program began in 2006 as a pilot program in the New York City region. which included Jersey City and Newark. Since 2007. the New York City region has purchased nearly 14.000 radiation detectors and has trained nearly 20.000 personnel. The pilot program has been so successful. it was expanded to the Los AngelesLong Beach region in fiscal year 2012. the national capital region in fiscal year 2014. and just last week the cities of Houston and Chicago were announced as the fiscal year 2015 and 2016 recipients. H.R. 3493 would authorize the Securing the Cities program. which has proven its utility as a pilot program. With continued authorization. we can assure that the extraordinary capability built by local law enforcement in conjunction with DHS does not become a hollow capability. unable to be effectively used at the critical moment. I would like to thank my colleagues who have helped bring this authorization to the floor. especially Chairman MCCAUL of the Homeland Security Committee. and my good friend PETE KING. and also my friend from Texas Representative JACKSON LEE. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140069592,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 3878. the Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act of 2015. This bill by my friend Representative TORRES contains an amendment I offered at committee. which makes an important change to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. More than $1.3 trillion worth of cargo travels through U.S. ports each year. making them a truly critical part of our Nations infrastructure. Any disruption or slowdown of activity could have a tremendous impact on the entire economy. costing billions of dollars every day. Ensuring the security of our maritime infrastructure is a complex task and one that falls primarily on the United States Coast Guard. However. while the Coast Guard has the history and the expertise to provide physical security. its mission of ensuring that our maritime infrastructure is safe from cyber threats is still evolving. Currently. the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 requires vessels and port facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and develop security plans for physical security. access controls. procedural security measures. and communication systems. My amendment in committee added cybersecurity to that list. This addition will make it crystal clear that the Coast Guard has the specific authority to require maritime vessels and facilities to incorporate cybersecurity into their assessments and plans. The need for this change and the underlying legislation was highlighted during a hearing before the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee on the topic of cybersecurity at our Nations ports. In that hearing. we heard how a range of actorsfrom narcotics traffickers to terrorist organizations. and even nationstatescould exploit cyber vulnerabilities at our ports for the purpose of smuggling illicit materials or causing severe economic disruption. Mr. Speaker. this legislation will ensure that we are better prepared to respond to the growing cyber threat to our Nations maritime infrastructure. I thank Representative TORRES for offering this legislation and for accepting my amendment at committee. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
1140083125,I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. Mr. Speaker. as the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Securitys Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications. I rise today in support of S. 1180. the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2015. This important legislation was introduced by the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator RON JOHNSON. IPAWS provides public safety officials with a mechanism to alert and warn the public about emergencies using multiple communication platforms. including the Emergency Alert System. Wireless Emergency Alerts. and NOAA Weather Radio. The bill we are considering today authorizes the IPAWS program and provides it with needed direction to help ensure that we can make available as much information to the public as possible to get them out of harms way in the event of a terror attack. natural disaster. or other threat to public safety. We know that these alerts can help to save lives. IPAWS was used after the Boston Marathon bombings to direct residents to shelter during the manhunt. In my district. IPAWS was used to warn people during Hurricane Sandy. Elsewhere. IPAWS has been vital to locating missing children through the AMBER Alert system. We also know that the system is not without its challenges. While I understand that in a recent test of the Emergency Alert System. a component of IPAWS. worked for stations in my home State of New York. there were challenges in other States. The test was canceled in several States due to weather concerns. However. a number of those States were not informed of the cancellation. leaving their broadcasters to wonder why the test didnt occur. We must ensure better communication between IPAWS and relevant stakeholders. That is why the IPAWS subcommittee of the National Advisory Council. established in this bill. is so important. This advisory committee will provide stakeholders with a mechanism to provide input into the program. Ensuring stakeholder engagement and feedback will serve to enhance the effectiveness of IPAWS. The Committee on Homeland Security has a long history of oversight of the IPAWS program. having held a number of hearings and briefings. Legislation similar to the bill we are considering today was approved by the Committee on Homeland Security just last year. Like the legislation passed out of the Committee on Homeland Security. this legislation is supported by the National Association of Broadcasters. the National Alliance of State Broadcasters Association. and CTIAThe Wireless Association. We thank these organizations for their continued engagement on this bill to improve the text and get us to this point. The enactment of legislation to authorize IPAWS has been a long time coming. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this commonsense legislation so that we can send it to the Presidents desk to be signed into law.
1140084968,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Securitys Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications. I rise in support of H.R. 4509. the State and HighRisk Urban Area Working Group Act. which was introduced by the subcommittees ranking member. Congressman PAYNE. The Homeland Security Act requires States and urban areas that are receiving State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Areas Security Initiative funds to have planning committees to determine how to efficiently and effectively expend these funds. H.R. 4509 expands the stakeholders who are required to be involved in these committees to include representatives from public health. educational institutions. fusion centers. and interoperability coordinators. as appropriate. In New York City. the New York City Police Department. the FDNY. emergency management. and public health. along with other partners. work together to ensure that these grant funds provide the biggest return on investment for the citys security. Time and again. these officials have told me how important these funds are to their ability to ensure the security of millions of residents. commuters. and visitors in the city each day. They have used these funds to train personnel. to conduct exercises. and to procure helicopters. fireboats. cameras. and radiation detection equipment. This funding is vital now more than ever. Securing highrisk urban areas. like New York City. becomes more challenging every day considering the fact that we are at our highest threat level since the September 11 terrorist attacks. That is why it is so outrageous that the Presidents fiscal year 2017 budget proposes to cut more than $500 million from grants to support States. localities. ports. and transit systems. The Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications held a hearing last month on the proposed cuts. We heard from representatives of emergency management. law enforcement. the fire service. and fusion centers. They all had the same message: these grants have made a difference. and cutting them now would have disastrous effects on their ability to prevent. to prepare for. and to respond to terrorist attacks. Not only would they be unable to make new security investments. but the investments they have made since 9/11 would be eroded. In this threat environment. this is not the time to back away from our support of our Nations first responders. Mr. Speaker. the States and urban areas that are receiving Homeland Security grant funding take their responsibilities to secure their areas very seriously. They diligently work through the planning committees that are discussed in this bill in order to make sure they make sound investments to secure their jurisdictions. The President must take the security of these jurisdictions equally as seriously and fund these programs accordingly. I support the passage of H.R. 4509. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140090282,I thank Congressman GUINTA and Congresswoman KUSTER for their leadership in this area. Mr. Speaker. this week the House of Representatives will act to pass a package of bills addressing the opioid crisis. One of them. the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act. will authorize new grant programs for cities and nonprofits for education. treatment. and enforcement. and not a minute too soon. Opioid abuse is an epidemic. It is everywhere you look. It is in our neighborhood. in our social circles. and in our schools. Too many parents have buried their sons and daughters or watched them struggle for years with addiction. treatment. and relapse. It has to stop. An effective response needs to address three areas: education. treatment. and enforcement. Todays youth have to be educated about the dangers of addiction. and loved ones need to learn to recognize the early signs. The legislation the House will pass this week authorizes new grants to prevent the next generation from abusing pills and heroin. Proven diversion programs. like the drug treatment courts I participated in as district attorney of Staten Island for 12 years. should have the resources and the staffing needed to accomplish their mission: To get users off of drugs. The Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act authorizes grants to establish new drug courts and expand those already in operation. However. we must follow up on our efforts this week and ensure that the grant application process is not overly complicated and onerous. In the past. the Federal grant processes has discouraged effective treatment organizations from seeking the resources made available by Congress. This is a national health emergency. and the bureaucracy must not get in the way of treatment. Mr. Speaker. this week marks a major step forward. Congress is directing resources towards programs and policies that have been effective. and will continue to evaluate what is working and what is not. By working together and getting the right tools to local experts. we can beat this demon of addiction.

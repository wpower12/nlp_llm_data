1140026018,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. my amendment is very simple. We should not implement a treatythe New START treaty in this caseunless we believe the other party to the treaty is trustworthy and will uphold their end of the bargain. Now. if you dont trust Vladimir Putin. then you should vote for this amendment. and let me explain why. Right now. I dont believe the Russians are trustworthy. We know that they are already violating three major agreements: the INF Treaty. the CFE Treaty. and the Budapest Memorandum. Mr. Putin also continues to deny that Russian forces are engaged in combat in Ukraine. Because this amendment deals with treaties. let me expand on the details of these three treaties. First. in 1994. Russia. Ukraine. the United Kingdom. and the United States signed the Budapest Memorandum. This agreement included a commitment to ""respect""and I have got a copy right here-""respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine"" and a commitment to ""refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine."" Clearly. the recent invasions of Crimea and eastern Ukraine show that the Russian Federation is in violation of the Budapest Memorandum. Second. in 1987. Reagan and Gorbachev signed the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces Treaty. or INF Treaty. Last year. the State Department released its annual compliance report which statesand I have a copy of it right here-""the United States has determined that the Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty."" Third. in 2007 President Putin announced that he was suspending Russian participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. or the CFE Treaty. This came after years of Russian violations of that treaty. Today. as we speak. the Russian military continues to occupy Ukrainian territory. Russian noncompliance with treaties cannot be disputed. My amendment would prevent the continued reduction of our nuclear weapons as required by the New START treaty unless the President can certify to Congress that the Russian Federation is no longer occupying Ukrainian territory and also certifies that the Russian Federation is abiding by their obligations under these three treaties. So if you think that the Russian Federation might not be trustworthy. then please support this amendment. We should not unilaterally disarm and blindly assume that the Russians will do their part. If the President can certify that the Russians are doing their part on these treaties. then the funding to implement the New START treaty will be released. Mr. Chairman. I urge adoption of this amendment. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1140033713,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will be offering and then withdrawing this amendment because of a point of order on the timing of the budget outlays that we are not able to reconcile at this point in time. But I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee. Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN. and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY. for their leadership. Now. this is an important amendment though. My amendment would protect from possible cancellation an innovative program that promises to provide a breakthrough capability for a very small amount of money. Right now. if Iran or North Korea launches a ballistic missile attack on our homeland. we. unfortunately. have no enhanced way of knowing whether or not our defensive missiles actually hit the target or not. That is why the Missile Defense Agency is executing a promising and groundbreaking space sensor system called SpaceBased Kill Assessment. The U.S. desperately needs improved sensors in space to provide tracking. discrimination. and more. A robust. multimission space sensor network will be vital to ensuring a strong missile defense program. Without this. we might otherwise waste extremely expensive groundbased interceptors. costing the taxpayer more money. and depleting our limited number of interceptors. The Spacebased Kill Assessment program cannot survive a 50 percent cut. Program cancellation may result. and it would waste taxpayer dollars already invested and would also fail to meet congressional intent to have an initial operating kill assessment capability by This experiment. up until today. has had zero scheduling delays since it was conceived in fiscal year 2014. Finally. this program is a great example of the cost savings and other benefits the government can leverage through commerciallyhosted satellite payloads. This program. and other similar efforts. are critical to ensuring that the United States stays ahead of future ballistic missile threats. I would hope that this amendment would have been adopted because it would take money from a lower priority fund and put it into critical ballistic missile defense against our homeland.
1140057240,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1937. the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2015. This bill was introduced by my good friend and colleague. Representative MARK AMODE of Nevada. and myself as the first cosponsor. Not a day goes by when Americans dont use a product that is made from critical minerals. In fact. life as we know it in the 21st century would not be possible without these minerals. There would be no computers. no BlackBerries. no iPhones. There would be no MRIs. CAT scans. or xray machines. There would be no wind turbines or solar panels. Mr. Chairman. the list is exhaustive of these things that depend on critical and strategic minerals that make our lives possible. Rare earth elements. a special subset of strategic and critical minerals. are core components of these products in the 21st century. Yet. despite the tremendous need for rare earth elements. the United States has allowed itself to become almost entirely dependent on China and other foreign nations for these resources. America has a plentiful supply of rare earth elements. but roadblocks to the development of these critical materials have resulted in China producing 97 percent of the worlds supply. That is 97 percent. Our current policies are handing China a monopoly on these elements. creating a dependence that has serious implications for American jobs. for our economy. and on our national security. Burdensome red tape. duplicative reviews. frivolous lawsuits. and onerous regulations can hold up new mining projects here in the U.S. for more than 10 years. These unnecessary delays cost American jobs as we become more and more dependent on foreign countries. such as China. for these raw materials. The lack of domestically produced strategic and critical minerals are prime examples of how the U.S. has regulated itself into a 100 percent dependency on at least 19 critical and unique minerals. It has also earned the United States the unique and unfortunate distinction of being ranked dead last when it comes to permitting mining projects. The 2014 ranking of countries for mining investment out of 25 major mining countries found that the 7- to 10year permitting delays are the most significant risk to mining projects in the U.S. We are dead last in that ranking. I cant speak for the other countries. but the reason the U.S. is so slow to issue new mining permits is very simple: government bureaucracy. H.R. 1937. introduced by my colleague from Nevada. will help us end foreign dependence by streamlining government red tape that blocks Americas strategic and critical mineral production. Instead of waiting for over a decade for mining permits to be approved. this bill sets a goal for the total review process for permitting at 30 months. 212 years. Now. this isnt a hard deadline. Mr. Chairman. It can be extended. But it is a goal to push the bureaucrats into action on these important infrastructure projects. It shouldnt take a decade to get a project built for minerals that we need in our everyday lives and for our national security. No company can reasonably forecast the price of minerals 10 years in advance. Finally. above all. this is a Jobs bill. The positive economic impact of this bill will extend beyond just the mining industry. For every goodpaying metal mining job created. an estimated 2.3 additional jobs are generated. For every nonmetal mining job created. another 1.6 jobs are created. This legislation gives the opportunity for American manufacturers. small businesses. technology companies. and construction firms to use American resources to help make the products that are essential to our everyday lives. As China continues to tighten global supplies of rare earth elements. we should respond with a U.S. mining renaissance that will bring mining and manufacturing jobs back. The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act. H.R. 1937. is important to our jobs and to our economy. We must act now to cut the Government red tape that is stopping American domestic production and furthering our dependence on foreign countries for our mineral needs. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140057287,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would urge rejection of this amendment because it would make the permitting process for critical and strategic minerals even worse than it currently is. It is already 7 to 10 or more years. It is dead last in the 25 major mineralproducing countries in the world. according to that recent study we cited earlier. This amendment would strike several key sections of the bill. including the NEPA provisions. the expedited schedule provision. the time limit provision. and the applicability of this law to existing permit application provision. First. this amendment seeks to remove the NEPA provisions. Our provision does not sidestep or avoid the NEPA process in any way. rather. it codifies a judicial determination for NEPA known as the functional equivalence doctrine. This doctrine provides that. when an agency action. whether State or Federal. has addressed the substantive requirements of NEPA. such action may be substituted as sufficient rather than having to prepare an entirely new and duplicative environmental study. This amendment rejects the functional equivalence doctrine and mandates that the issuance of every mineral exploration or mine permit constitutes a ""major Federal action."" thereby requiring the development of costly and timeconsuming environmental impact statements. regardless of a proposed projects size. Furthermore. this amendment strikes the provisions of the bill that requires the authorizing agency to develop a schedule for the permit process. and it removes the 30month time constraints that would be put on said authorizing agency. In other words. it restores the current 7- to 10year permit process that plagues the mining industry and the production of jobs and the growth of our economy. Let me mention one thing about automobile manufacturing in particular. An automobile contains rare earths for magnets. copper. aluminum. platinum. and many other critical minerals and elements. According to Rare Earth Technology Alliance. the average hybrid car contains 61 pounds of rare earth metals. So it is important that we pass this bill. This amendment unfortunately guts the bill. I would urge opposition to it. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140065876,Mr. Chairman. I want to let my colleague from Colorado know that this is an unnecessary amendment. so I would ask Members to oppose it. There already is a lot of builtin notification that does take place. I dont know if my colleague is aware of this or not. but when an expression of interest for leasing is made. the BLM requires that all of the surface owners. wherever this expression of interest for leasing applies to. are notified by mail. Secondly. before a permit is issued. there is another notification to the surface owners of wherever that lease is located. Thirdly. under the NEPA process. before the leases are even issued. the public is notified. I know this amendment talks about notifying everyone within 1 mile. The public notification is a lot broader than just 1 mile. so. actually. current law does more than what this amendment calls for. But there are two different steps. in addition to the public notice. where the surface landowner actually is notified by mail by a good faith effort required by the Bureau of Land Management for Federal lands. On top of all that. Mr. Chairman. I ask opposition for this amendment because it is poorly written. It is ambiguous as to whether it is only applying to Federal lands or is broader and would include tribal lands. private lands. and things way out of the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. But. in any case. even if it would just apply to the Federal lands. it is unnecessary. Because of the different steps that are required under the language of this amendment. it would add a lot of paperwork and red tape and really not accomplish anything more than what is already clearly accomplished two or three times under existing law. For all those reasons. Mr. Chairman. I ask that we oppose this amendment. I know it is wellintentioned. but the law already takes care of this. This amendment. besides being poorly written. would add a lot of time and paperwork and red tape to the process right now. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140085568,Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the leadership of Representative DESANTIS and Representative JORDAN in holding the Obama administration accountable. Mr. Speaker. I rise tonight to call for the impeachment of John Koskinen. Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. for high crimes and misdemeanors. This effort is needed to hold the IRS Commissioner accountable for allowing documents to be destroyed and for providing misleading statements to Congress after IRS targeted conservative organizations. I am a cosponsorand proud to be oneof the resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. As it has become abundantly clear. Commissioner Koskinen has failed the American people by stonewalling congressional investigations into the IRS targeting scandal. Conservative organizations were intentionally targeted by our Federal Government simply because they believed and expressed a message that was in opposition to the administration. Now. while I may disagree with many on the left. I would never seek to threaten them by use of government force and coercion and take away their freedom of speech. Moreover. what is truly disturbing about the IRS scandal is that Commissioner Koskinen has violated the public trust. As a Commissioner. he failed to comply with a congressional subpoena. failed to ensure that evidence was preserved. failed to testify truthfully. and failed to notify Congress when he learned that thousands of emails were missing. Our constituents expect Congress to exercise oversight of this administration and to demand accountability. We know the IRS Commissioner cannot be trusted. Impeachment would help rectify this sorry situation and would go a long way toward showing the American people that we are serious about our constitutional duties. Impeachment is the appropriate means to restore balance between the branches of government. The Framers included impeachment in the Constitution for precisely this scenario. where an executive branch official who violated the public trust will not resign and they refuse to fire him. That is exactly what should happen here. IRS Commissioner Koskinen must go.
1140108210,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. the process of hydraulic fracturing. often used in combination with horizontal drilling. has unlocked vast new American energy resources. making the United States the largest energy producer in the world. This creates tens of thousands of goodpaying jobs and lower energy prices for consumers. Despite this technological advancement. the Obama administration. acting through the Bureau of Land Management. has sought to regulate it out of existence by trying to institute new. onerous regulations regarding well construction and water management for hydraulic fracturing operations that take place on Federal and Indian lands. Thankfully. the U.S. District Court in Wyoming recently struck down BLMs hydraulic fracturing rule. finding that the BLM lacks authority from Congress to regulate the process of fracking. and was acting contrary to law. As expected. the Obama administration has filed an appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court. Despite being illegal. these burdensome regulations simply do not recognize the extensive work done by the States to regulate hydraulic fracturing within their borders. The Natural Resources Committee has heard from numerous witnesses from Utah. Wyoming. Colorado. and other States. who have testified to the tireless process these States went through to draft and implement their regulationsregulations that are very successful. My home State of Colorado has been safely using hydraulic fracturing for over 40 years. and has the toughest Hydraulic Fracturing Disclosure Rule in the Nation. Even our Democratic Governor. John Hickenlooper. who has actually drunk hydraulic fracturing fluid to show that it is safe. believes it is the States responsibility to regulate industry. And this amendment will do exactly that by ensuring that States like Colorado can continue to safely regulate energy production based on local geology and conditions without unnecessary and unlawful interference from the Federal Government. One size does not fit all and the States frequentlyI think alwaysknow better than the Federal bureaucrats in Washington do what their geology is like. what their water is like. and so son. So I ask that you support my amendment and allow the current energy renaissance to continue ensuring a stable supply of affordable and reliable energy. This will help drive down prices for gasoline. electricity. and home heating. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140108216,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. my amendment is straightforward. It simply ensures that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is following current law. specifically. section 4(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act. by conducting a review of all threatened and endangered plants and wildlife at least once every 5 years. Time after time. the Federal Government refuses to follow the Endangered Species Act. The government designates land as critical habitat. despite not meeting the ESA. Endangered Species Act. definition. and the government consistently refuses to remove plants and animals from threatened or endangered status. even when these species are flourishing and are no longer in need of ESA protections. But you may ask yourself: How does the government know when the species should be removed from the endangered or threatened list? How does the government know if a species is recovering? The answer can be found in the ESA and its requirement that the Federal Government reviews all plants or species that are currently listed as endangered or threatened every 5 years. Under the act. the purpose of a 5year review is to ensure that threatened or endangered species have the appropriate level of protection. The reviews assess each threatened and endangered species to determine whether its status has changed since the time of its listing. or its last status review. and whether it should be removed from the list. delisted. reclassified from endangered to threatened. which is downlisted. reclassified from threatened to endangered. uplisted. or just maintain the species current classification. the status quo. And because the act grants extensive protection to a species. including harsh penalties for landowners and other citizens. it makes sense to regularly verify if a plant or animal is being properly classified or should be delisted. Despite this commonsense requirement. the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has acknowledged that it has neglected its responsibility to conduct the required reviews for hundreds of listed species. For example. in Florida alone. it was found that 77 species. out of a total of 124 protected species in the State. were overdue for a 5year review. In other words. the government had not followed the law for a staggering 62 percent of species in that State. In California. the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledged that it had failed to follow the law for roughly twothirds of the State species listed under the Endangered Species Act and was forced by the courts to conduct the required reviews of 194 species. By enforcing the 5year review. my amendment will ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is using the best available scientific information in implementing its responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act. including incorporating new information through public comment and assessing ongoing conservation efforts. I encourage my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service follows the Endangered Species Act and that we do not provide money in this bill that would violate current law. I ask you to support my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140108223,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. this is my third and last amendment on this bill. and I am hopeful that maybe this is one we can agree on. Mr. Chairman. the Prebles meadow jumping mouse is a tiny rodent with a body approximately 3 inches long. a 4to 6inch long tail. and large hind feet adapted for jumping. This largely nocturnal mouse lives primarily in stream side ecosystems along the foothills of southeastern Wyoming south to Colorado Springs in my district along the eastern ridge of the Front Range of Colorado. To evade predators. the mouse can jump like a miniature kangaroo up to 18 inches high using its long. whiplike tail as a rudder to switch directions in midair. But the little acrobats most famous feet was its leap onto the Endangered Species list in May. 1998. a move that has hindered development from Colorado Springs. Colorado. to Laramie. Wyoming. Among projects that have been affected: the Jeffco Parkway southeast of Rocky Flats. an expansion of Chatfield Reservoir. and housing developments in El Paso County along tributaries of Monument Creek. Builders. landowners. and local governments in affected areas have incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in added costs because of this mouse. And protecting the Prebles mouse has even been placed ahead of protecting human life. On September 11. 2013. Colorado experienced a major flood event that damaged or destroyed thousands of homes. important infrastructure. and public works projects. As a result of the Prebles mouses listing as an endangered species. many restoration projects were delayed as Colorado sought a waiver. In fact. FEMA was so concerned that they sent out a notice that stated: ""Legally required review may cause some delay in projects undertaken in the Prebles mouse habitat."" It goes on to warn that ""local officials who proceed with projects without adhering to environmental laws risk fine and could lose Federal funding for their projects."" While a waiver was eventually granted. the scientific evidence simply does not justify these delays or the millions of taxpayer dollars that go toward protecting a mouse that is actually part of a larger group that roams throughout half of the North American continent. Scientific studies have concluded that the Prebles mouse does not warrant protection because it isnt a subspecies at all. and is actually related to the Bear Lodge jumping mouse. Even the scientist that originally classified this mouse as a subspecies has since recanted his work. Moreover. the Prebles mouse has a low conservation parity scoremeaning the hundreds of millions of dollars already spent on protection efforts could have been better spent on other. more fragile species. My amendment would correct the injustice that has been caused by the inaccurate listing of the Prebles meadow jumping mouse and refocus the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services efforts on species that have been thoroughly scientifically vetted and that should be managed by the Endangered Species Act. Mr. Chairman. I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time."

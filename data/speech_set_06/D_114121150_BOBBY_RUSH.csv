1140008696,Madam Speaker. this is deja vu all over again. as for the umpteenth time the majority party is trying to jam the Keystone XL pipeline through this Congress despite the fact that President Obama has made it pretty clear to all who will listen that this bill is headed to a veto if it ever reaches his desk. Madam Speaker. instead of going through regular order and the committee process and working on bipartisan legislation that would ultimately create hundreds of thousands of goodpaying American jobs. such as building up our infrastructure. fixing our roads and bridges. and modernizing our energy grid. instead of looking at the interests. the real interests of the American people. and working to provide the American people muchneeded jobs. my friends on the other side of the aisle have repeatedly spent valuable time. time that this Congress will never. ever see again. trying to grant a regulatory earmark to the TransCanada Corporation by shortcircuiting the normal permitting process and forcing President Obamas hand. This is not a jobs bill. Madam Speaker. we need a jobs bill. But where are the jobs in this bill? Every time we talk about jobs. every time jobs develop on the floor of this House. the Republicans all run to one place: that all we need is to build the Keystone XL pipeline and that will solve Americas job problem. I beg to differ with my friends on the other side of the aisle. The State Departmentour State Departmentconsulted with TransCanada and found out that the construction of this pipeline would directly result in about 4.000 jobs in the early stages just to build the pipeline. These jobs. Madam Speaker. will last no more than 12 months365 days of work provided to the American people. What kind of jobs bill are we trying to perpetrate on the American people? In addition. Madam Speaker. by building the pipeline. 42.100 1year jobs will be created indirectly across the United States. After the Keystone XL pipeline is completed. operation. where the permanent jobs are. the real operation where the lasting jobs are. the jobs that will provide a future for American familiescollege education. mortgages to pay for their home. put dinner on the tablethese jobs would only amount to about 35 permanent jobs in this Nation35. A franchise burger joint on the corner will provide more permanent jobs than this whole Keystone XL pipeline is purported to do. Lets put these figures into perspective. In 2014. the U.S. economy created nearly 50.000 jobs per week50.000 per week in 2014. 230.000 jobs per month. So even taking the most favorable estimates for all the indirect and direct jobs. the Keystone XL pipeline will produce fewer jobs than the economy is already creating on its own in just 7 daysin just one week. Taking the lowest estimate for the 35 permanent jobs again. the Keystone XL pipeline will produce even fewer jobs. in all of its massiveness. in all of the hyperbole that comes from the other side. than the economy is already creating in just 1 hour. In the next hour. Mr. Speaker. the American economy will produce more jobs than the entire Keystone XL pipeline in all of its durationin just the next hour. This is not a jobs bill. Where are the priorities for the other side? Why are we wasting time on this? Let me remind my friends on the other side. in just 2 weeksjust 2 weeksthe Homeland Security Department will run out of money. putting all of the American people. our entire Nation. at risk. in just 2 weeks. Where are your priorities? Doesnt that make more sense than wasting our time on creating 35 jobs35 permanent jobs? We are going to be out of this place at the end of the week. Where is the priority for American security? Where is the priority for us to spend our time? What are the priorities of the majority if we are going to waste our time? Here we go again. valuable time. Homeland Security running out of money. folks being laid off. our borders are being compromised. terrorists are going to have or could have a field day because we have not funded Homeland Security. Yet we are here. wasting valuable time. Lets use this time to fund the Department of Homeland Security. and lets get off some of this nonsense that makes no sense at all. I cannot believe. Mr. Speaker. that the American people have sent us here to work on behalf of TransCanada and to ignore the Department of Homeland Security. I cant in my wildest imagination believe that they didnt even know. that they didnt even imagine. that they didnt even think that we are here with the Department of Homeland Security on one side and the Keystone XL on the other side. Go figure. Where are their priorities? Mr. Speaker. this bill is unnecessary. This bill will be vetoed by President Obama. and it will be sent back here DOA. We have far more important work that we should be doing on behalf of the American people. I urge all of my colleagues to turn down this unnecessary. illtimed. illconceived notion that we should be spending our valuable time on the Keystone XL and ignoring the funding for the Department of Homeland Security.
1140023761,Mr. Speaker. within the last hour or so. there was a decision by the Baltimore City States Attorney Marilyn Mosby in the investigation of the death of Freddie Gray. a Black man who died under questionable circumstances. circumstances that kind of made us all wonder where the truth lies. circumstances that cause young people and others to take to the streets across this Nation. circumstances that brought into a sharp. bright light the question of justice in America. the question of police misconduct in America. the question of mayhem in America. the question of poverty in America. and the question of bias in America. Freddie Grays murder. Freddie Grays death. and the questionable circumstances around his death brought into sharp relief all of these issues of race and living in an urban centerbrought into sharp relief. Mr. Speaker. 50 years or more of abject. determined. and callous disinvestment in our urban areas. 50 years or more of joblessness. bad schools. bad housing. bad health care. and 50 years of hopelessness. In the last few minutes. Mr. Speaker. this brilliant. young. African American woman. Baltimore City States Attorney Marilyn Mosby. made a decision. and she decided that. yes. notwithstanding all the differences of opinion. the changed stories. the moving target. notwithstanding all of these things that happened. she decided that Freddie Gray was murderedFreddie Gray was murderedand that she would indict the police officers who were responsible. By indicting the Baltimore City police officers who were responsible for Mr. Grays murder. she made a giant. enormous step for justice for young people. young African American men and women. young people who live in our urban areas. By her decision today. just a few moments ago. she has done this Nation an invaluable service. especially for young people. especially for the African American and other minority youth. These young people have. for decades now. sought and yearned for justice as it relates to police misconduct. police brutality. and. yes. police murder. This new standard for justice is a standard that now transcends Baltimore and transcends even the entire State of Maryland. It transcends and it reaches to other points all across this NationFerguson. New York City. Chicago. Cleveland. and other places all throughout this country. Mr. Speaker. as an African American male who represents the South Side of the city of Chicago. I know firsthand about police misconduct. police mayhem. and police murder. I must say. Mr. Speaker. that. in my 68 years living mostly in the city of Chicago. I have never seen the wheels of justice move so profoundly. so pointedly. and so purposefully as I have witnessed with Baltimore City States Attorney Marilyn Mosbys actions. She has raised all kinds of standards. She has captured the imagination of all of us who fight for justice. who want to see justice delivered in the true American way. and who want to see an end to all the machinations. excuses. turning away. and closing our eyes to police misconduct in our urban areas. This wonderful. courageous. young city States attorney has raised the standard for prosecutors all across our great Nation. She has raised the standards for mayors. chiefs of police. and other law enforcement officials. She has raised the standard for even those who are in this body. Open your minds. open your eyes. and see the truth. Let me just say right now. Mr. Speaker. that the police officers of this Nation. the overwhelming majority of them. are good. hardworking defenders of the community. They are not lawbreakers. They are there to serve and protect. We honor them. and we lift them up. but there are a few who think that they can get away with all kinds of illegal actions just because they can get away with it because the system has a tendency and a habit of rising to protect even those who violate not only the laws of the Nation. but the spirit of the laws of this Nation. these laws that keep this Nation together. these laws that make us have an identity as one nation under God. indivisible. with liberty and justice for all. These police officers. this minority of those on the urban police forces across this Nation. these are the ones that abrogate the Constitution. shortcircuit our Constitution. shortcircuit our quest for justice. our appeal for justice. our right for justice. and shortcircuit those just for their thrill of the moment. Can you imagine. Mr. Speaker. being handcuffed and legcuffed. laying down facedown in the back of a paddy wagon driven not accidentally recklessly. determined by those police officers who were driving. who had him in custody. to maim. harm. and brutalize him. different speeds driven by the driver of that van. tossed about because of sudden stops? You are in the back of a paddy wagon. handcuffed and legcuffed. and these police officers are getting a thrill out of tossing you around in a steelencased paddy wagon. not caring about the broken parts of your body that might occur. not caring about whether you really live or die. not even caring about their oath that they were sworn to when they were hired and when they took that oath to serve and protect. All those things became secondary to their thrill of seeing how much havoc and harm they could cause to this Black man in Baltimore. Yeah. they thought they would get away with it. that no one would even think to question their decisions. their thrillseeking. their conduct. Thank God there is a woman in Baltimore who said to them. to all the police officers who are like minded such as them. said to this Nation: No more. No more. not this time. You are going to be indicted. and you are going to be charged. and that is the way it is. Grieving mothers. Mr. Grays mother. his father. his relatives. his loved ones. his friends. and his neighbors can all now say that there will be justice for Freddie Gray. I said. in Chicago. there will be justice for Freddie Gray. From this Nations borders. young people are rejoicing now. The day is soon to be justice for Freddie Gray. Mr. Speaker. Ms. Mosbys actions. her courage. her dedication. her commitment. and her decisiveness have spoken to the idea that is creating this movement for justice all across this Nation. She has very clearly and profoundly and without hesitation spoken to all of us. to this Nation. Her actions have shouted out that Black lives do matter. that Black lives do matter. that all lives in America matter. and that Black lives matter also. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140038061,"Mr. Chairman. the legislation before us. which I prefer to call the ""Just Say No"" bill. would effectively give Governors the power to opt out of the Federal requirements of the EPAs proposed clean power plan if they decide that complying with the plan would have an adverse effect on either rates or reliability. Unfortunately. Mr. Chairman. the language allowing a Governor to opt out is ambiguous and does not take into account other costs that States are already paying due to the impacts of climate change. So. Mr. Chairman. in order to address this issue. I am offering a straightforward amendment that simply states that a Governor must certify that. within his or her State. any ratepayer increases associated with implementing a State or Federal plan would be greater than any costs associated with responding to extreme weather conditions associated with humancaused climate change. Mr. Chairman. this would include the costs associated with cleaning up after mass flooding. intense wildfires. more frequent and intense storms. as well as the costs associated with loss of crops and livestock due to increased drought. Mr. Chairman. as any State that has had to deal with the aftermath of any of these destructive extreme weather events can attest. Americans are already shouldering the costs of climate changeand these costs are getting worse and worse. In fact. according to the National Climate Assessment. if we do not seriously invest in addressing climate change impacts now. we can expect to see more expensive and costly future damages associated with almost every facet of our society. from negative health impacts. to stressing our infrastructure and water system. to harming our national security. up to and including hurting our overall longterm economic growth. Mr. Chairman. just 2 days ago. on Monday. the EPA. in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. the Pacific Northwest National Lab. and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. released a peerreviewed study detailing the costs if we fail to address climate change. This report stated that failure to act could cost 12.000 lives from extreme temperatures and 57.000 lives from poor air quality in the year 2100. as well as cost the country hundreds of billions of dollars each and every year. The analysis also looked at the impact of climate change on health. electricity. infrastructure. water resources. agriculture. forestry. and the ecosystem. It found that if we acted to reduce emissions. we could avert loss of life. reduce the number of droughts and floods. and save up to $34 billion in power system costs in the year 2050 alone. So. Mr. Chairman. with all of these dire warnings coming from both the experts as well as from Mother Nature herself. we cannot allow Governors to ""just say no"" to reducing harmful pollutants from their States and simply put their heads in the sand. Mr. Chairman. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that Governors are held accountable for their failure to act to reduce harmful pollutants that impact the overall public good."
1140049263,Mr. Speaker. Scripture says that you shall know the tree by the fruit that it bears. A good tree bears good fruit. Strong trees bring forth strong fruit. Loving trees bear loving fruit. Mr. Speaker. what then is to be said about a tree whose fruit is a respected and courageous freedom fighter? Mr. Speaker. I am speaking of a great woman of distinction. Helen Burns Jackson. the mother of renowned Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson. Sr.. who is the founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition that is based in the First Congressional District of Illinois. Mother Burns Jackson. Mr. Speaker. was the epitome of a strong. good. fruitbearing tree. She made her transition from life to eternity on September 7. 2015. after a lengthy illness. She was surrounded by her loving family and her friends. A native of Greenville. South Carolina. Ms. Burns Jackson instilled in her children a sense of dignity. selfrespect. and loving justice in the face of the inhumane treatment of African Americans in the segregated South. Born in 1925. she endured the hardships of poverty. the hardships of racism. to raise two sons of great accomplishment. great distinction. an American hero and civil rights legend. the Reverent Jesse Louis Jackson. Senior. and the Motown music phenomenon Charles Jackson. A gifted singer of world renowned. Mrs. Burns Jackson herself was a singer and dancer. and she passed on a scholarship to a great college to raise her two sons. Her life. Mr. Speaker. was the quintessential American story of overcoming the odds with an unbreakable will and a deep. abiding faith. She planted the seeds of courage. the seeds of perseverance. and the seeds of hope in Reverend Jackson and in his brother. Charles. Reverend Jackson would go on to not only free American hostages. but became the freedom fighter for those who are oppressed and those who are poor all around this globe. It is on this very day. September 10. 2015. that I rise before the House of Representatives to pay tribute to this beautiful and extraordinary Movement mother. Mrs. Jackson was a cosmetologist by profession. and she was known as a towering pillar of her community. Her home became the central station of the civil rights movement. Mr. Speaker. she often provided me with great encouragement when she traveled to Chicago to visit her son and his family. As a young activist. I certainly was inspired by her words of wisdom. As a young activist. she inspired me to commit myself to serving others. Mr. Speaker. it has been said that trees are the Earths endless efforts to nurture life. Mrs. Helen Burns Jackson was a beautiful tall tree among all of us who has returned to the heavenly glory of her God. our God Almighty. Her spirit lives not only in her children. her grandchildren. and in her great -grandchildren. but her spirit also lives in the righteous fruits that may be found in those of us who were touched by the endless love. the great kindness. the great grace. and the tremendous wisdom of Ms. Helen Burns Jackson. Mr. Speaker. on behalf of the citizens of the First Congressional District and on behalf of my loving wife. Carolyn. we pay tribute to this remarkable and special woman. this great tree. this inspiration to all of us. Ms. Helen Burns Jackson. She is indeed a mother of the movement. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140079335,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. let me begin by commending Chairman UPTON. Chairman WHITFIELD. Ranking Member PALLONE. and the committee staff for working with my office to bring the 21st century workforce legislation to the House floor today. I would also publicly acknowledge the leadership of my colleague. Mr. HUDSON of North Carolina. and his staff who played an instrumental role in helping us to get to this very point. The good faith talks held between my office. the majority and the minority committee staff. and Mr. HUDSONS office have resulted in this bipartisan jobs bill that will go a long way in helping to get our Nations economy back on track and working for everyone. Mr. Speaker. this workforce bill before us provides an example of how Congress should function and how Congress should work on behalf of the American people. Here we have bipartisan members of the Energy and Commerce Committee who represent various constituencies from diverse regions of the country and who come from different political persuasions. However. Mr. Speaker. it must be well noted that we were able to put aside our differences and focus our efforts on bringing forth a jobs bill that will benefit all of our Nations communities and help lift up the entire American economy. And exactly what does this bill do. Mr. Speaker? This bill directs the Secretary of Energy to prioritize the training of underrepresented groups. including minorities. women. veterans. as well as displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers. in order to increase the number of skilled candidates trained to work in these same related fields. Mr. Speaker. this bill will strengthen and more fully engage DOE programs and national laboratories in order to carry out the Departments workforce development initiatives. That includes the Minorities in Energy Initiative that was established 2 years ago. with my encouragement. under Secretary Monizs leadership. There will be a clearinghouse of information and resources on training and workforce development programs for energy and manufacturingrelated jobs. State by State and region by region all across our Nation. Mr. Speaker. this bill will help increase outreach to minorityserving institutions to ensure that the wealth of existing resources at DOE are made available to these worthy establishments. It will also provide additional outreach to displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers with the objective of improving the opportunities for these candidates to find employment. This legislation. Mr. Speaker. will help to develop a skilled labor force. trained to work in a wide array of sectors. including renewables. energy efficiency. oil and gas. coal. nuclear. utility. pipelines. alternative fuels. as well as energyintensive and advanced manufacturing industries. Mr. Speaker. one of the challenges that I have heard far too many times from my constituents is of individuals participating in training programs that in many cases do not always lead to actually finding a job. With that in mind. Mr. Speaker. this bill will help industry. help schools. and help communitybased workforce development organizations to identify candidates for enrollment into training and apprenticeship programs. with the objective of ensuring that the skills learned are immediately transferable to goodpaying jobs and goodpaying careers within the energy and manufacturing sectors regionally. nationally. and. indeed. all across this globe. Mr. Speaker. as you well know. and as all Members in this House know. the energy and manufacturing industries are two of the most critical and fastest growing sectors both domestically as well as internationally. The potential of these two sectors can help bolster the American economy and are also vital to the growing number of people seeking middle class status all across the developing world. It is important. Mr. Speaker. that we equip our citizens. those who need jobs and those who are out of work. with the skills needed and necessary to meet this growing demand so that we can tap into these tremendous opportunities. This very bill before us today will accomplish that goal. Why is the 21st century workforce bill so very necessary? Mr. Speaker. just last week. my office had yet another visiting delegation. a meeting this time with an energy company out of the great State of North Carolina. whose representatives informed me that right now. today. as we stand here in this great Chamber today. they have over 1.000 job openings that they cannot fill because they cannot find enough qualified skilled workers. The 21st century workforce bill will address that difficulty and be a solution to that and many other similar problems all across our country. In fact. Mr. Speaker. my office has been holding many of these same types of meetings over the past 4 years with a variety of different energy and manufacturing industries that are indeed facing this very same predicament. At a time when African American and Latino unemployment rates are still too high. when coal workers throughout Appalachia and beyond are finding themselves without work. when too many female heads of household cannot find adequate employment to take care of their families. and when veterans returning home from defending our Nation still cannot find a job. it is a travesty and a shame that eager employers still cannot find the trained workers they need. Mr. Speaker. this is a commonsense jobs bill that will help to match up trained. qualified candidates with goodpaying jobs and careers that will fit them and their families. help lift up their community. help strengthen the energy and manufacturing industry. and will bolster the entire American economy as a whole. Whether you are a student pursuing your engineering degree at an HBCU or a single mother taking classes at your neighborhood community college. this bill seeks to provide additional opportunity to all those individuals who are out there looking to better themselves and improve the financial situation for their families. Mr. Speaker. when this bill becomes law and its provisions are implemented. it will help outofwork coal miners retool and retrain for the jobs of the 21st century. This bill will also help returning veterans use their skills and use their talents to find employment and provide a dignified future for their families. So. Mr. Speaker. again. I want to thank my distinguished colleague from the great State of Michigan. Chairman UPTON. my friend from the great State of Kentucky. Chairman WHITFIELD. Ranking Member PALLONE. my friend from North Carolina . and all my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee. as well as those who are on the Education and the Workforce Committee who helped bring us to this point today. where we are bringing forward this bill with this focus not only on underserved communities. such as minorities. women. and veterans. but also displaced and unemployed coal miners and outofwork energy workers in other places. I can assure you. Mr. Speaker. when this bill ultimately becomes law. it will go a long way in helping not only communities that look like the one I represent on the south side of Chicago. but every community in every district throughout this Nation. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140080458,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4557 is an unnecessary bill that would set a terrible precedent. As the Statement of Administration Policy. which outlines the justification for President Obamas veto threat. states: ""H.R. 4557 would undermine the public health protections of the Clean Air Act by allowing further emissions of approximately 30 tons per month of toxic air pollution from brick and clay products production facilities. These toxic emissions include mercury. gases. and other hazardous metals which are associated with a variety of acute and chronic health effects. including cancers."" Mr. Speaker. the statement from President Obama goes on to say: ""Because H.R. 4557 threatens the health of Americans by allowing more toxic air pollution. if the President were presented with H.R. 4557. his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill."" Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4557 is the wrong remedy at the wrong time. Mr. Speaker. this bill is premature. While I understand that the industry feels that it has been penalized for complying with the 2003 rule. that is not sufficient reason in itself to set up a unique process that incentivizes all parties that object to this rule to file endless challenges to the rulemaking. The Brick and Clay Maximum Achievable Control Technology. or MACT. regulations that are the subject of this legislation are the subject of ongoing legal actions by industry and by public health communities across this Nation. The courts already have the ability to grant a stay on this rule. yet for some reason the industry has not yet made that request to the court. But there are a number of pending cases filed by the industry on this very rule. This week. Mr. Speaker. it was reported that the industry petitioned the court to put four suits on hold until the EPA decides whether to grant their requests to reconsider the regulations. The pending decision by the court and by the EPA indicate that there is no need for H.R. 4557. as there are ample remedies available under the Clean Air Act to address concerns about this rule. Additionally. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4557 does not actually address the merits or the faults with the Brick and Clay MACT rules. Instead. what this bill does is takes these rules and this rulemaking outside of the process in the Clean Air Act that allows the EPA to issue final rules with deadlines for their implementation. without waiting for the conclusion of all the appeals and all the reviews. Mr. Speaker. this bill would also delay any subsequent rule issued that is similar in scope and similar in objective until any legal challenges to it were completed as well. In other words. Mr. Speaker. this bill allows an opportunity for endless lawsuits on this very issue. I fear. Mr. Speaker. that if H.R. 4557 were to become law. we would end up in a situation where we would never. ever control air polluting emissions from these facilities. no matter how costeffective or how necessary that rule might be. Mr. Speaker. this is a policy that we must reject. As the Statement of Administration Policy also noted. if rules cannot go forward until all legal actions are complete. there is a strong incentive to use frivolous legal challenges to prevent any rules from being implemented. Under that scenario. we never would have achieved the improvements in air quality and in public health that have been accomplished under the Clean Air Act. We know. Mr. Speaker. that the Clean Air Act has delivered many costeffective health benefits to the American people over the years. It has been demonstrated many times that we do not have to make a choice between healthy air and jobs in this Nation. We can have both. We cannot agree. Mr. Speaker. to setting this precedent and establishing a process that will delay important public health protections and encourage. at the same time. frivolous legal challenges to our clean air rules. The brick. clay. and tile industries would be better served by pursuing the options available to them right now under the Clean Air Act. For all of these reasons. Mr. Speaker. I must urge all of my colleagues to oppose this bill. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140080478,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I dont know why we are even here debating this issue. which is an important issue. but not a prevailing issue. This is an issue that concerns one industry. It is a concern that is already under consideration by the courts and by the administration. In fact. Mr. Speaker. it is a problem that is more appropriately addressed by those branches of government than by this Congress. There are many other issues that this Congress has before it that it is our job to address. Yet. Mr. Speaker. we are not spending ample time on those things that are closely tied to the economic benefits and jobs for all Americans. Our water infrastructure. Mr. Speaker. is in dire need of repair and maintenance. We spend little to no time on our water infrastructure and the problems associated with it. We have Superfund sites and brownfield sites that need to be cleaned up and put to productive use. No time. no energy. no congressional resources are used to address these vital issues. Our States need support for modernizing and hardening the electricity grid. We are AWOL on these issues. And still. Mr. Speaker. many Americans are underemployed. unemployed. and underpaid for the work that they are doing. Where is the time allocation. the resource allocation? Where are our efforts on behalf of these people? All of these things. Mr. Speaker. particularly and especially the infrastructure issue. must be addressed by the Congress. There is no other place that can address these issues as appropriately. as effectively. as efficiently. except this Congress. And these issues. these infrastructure issues affect every industry. every State. every American in our Nation. So. Mr. Speaker. let us use this bodys time and efforts on the critical issues that are of great importance to the American people. Mr. Speaker. our time could be better served if we would just address some of these prevailing issues of the day. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140087181,Mr. Speaker. I come here to the House floor today to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding the grave financial challenges facing the Chicago State University. which is located in my district on the south side of Chicago. Mr. Speaker. due to the enormous budget crisis currently taking place in my home State of Illinois. the university has not received the State funding that is essential to maintaining its multifaceted operations. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. after 7 months of utilizing its financial reserves. Chicago State University is now in a dire position. Chicago State University must confront the real possibility of closing its doors in the immediate future. Mr. Speaker. the impact of this pending reality is far reaching in its scope. and it would adversely affect thousands of students and hundreds of faculty and staff. many of whom reside in my district. the First District of Illinois. The entire Chicagoland region would be severely adversely affected by the closing of the Chicago State University. Mr. Speaker. my district is home to 4.300 students who are enrolled at Chicago State. Fiftyeight percent of these students are my constituents. The great need for this institution is demonstrated by the fact that almost 88 percent of enrolled students receive financial aid. Of those students on financial aid. 44 percent are firstgeneration college students. and 54 percent of these students are lowincome individuals. In fact. Mr. Speaker. Chicago State University is renowned for recruiting and graduating nontraditional minority students who. due to a variety of reasons. have been denied many of the economic. social. and educational benefits enjoyed by the greater American society. As U.S. News and World Report notes. Chicago State University ranks first in Illinois in awarding bachelors degrees to African Americans in the physical sciences. health professions. and other related sciences. Additionally. the school also ranks fourth in Illinois in awarding baccalaureate degrees to Latino students in the education sector. Mr. Speaker. closing Chicago State University. even on a temporary basis. would have a profound impact on the lives of all these students who have worked so hard to beat the odds and who desperately seek to provide a better life for themselves and for their families. Additionally. as one of my districts largest employers. if the university were to close. it would have a devastating rippling effect on the economics of Chicagos greater south side and also in the lives of the 850 faculty and staff who are employed by Chicago State University. Undoubtedly. the schools closing would also stifle any opportunity for economic recovery in communities on Chicagos south side and in the nearby suburban area of the city of Chicago. To help address this pending dire situation. in the coming days I will be introducing a bill in the House to provide Federal assistance to the university until this budget impasse in the State of Illinois can be resolved. Mr. Speaker. Chicago State University is far too important to the families. to the communities that I represent. to simply leave its fate to chance or to the political gamesmanship and indifference of its governmental leaders. Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner should not allow this historically crucial. minorityserving institution of higher education that so faithfully serves the needs of African Americans and Latino American students to shut down on his watch. Legislative leaders in the State of Illinois must not allow this legendary institution to close its doors on current and future generations of upwardbound students. [ 1900 Mr. Speaker. April 29 will be forever be known as the Day of Educational Infamy in my State of Illinois. It will be regarded as the day that Illinois lawmakers let the students of Chicago State University down. It will be regarded as the day that Illinois lawmakers let the citizens of the State of Illinois down. It will be regarded as the day that Illinois lawmakers stood in the schoolhouse door to deny access to the universally acknowledged benefits of higher education to predominantly minority students who study and matriculate at the Chicago State University. Mr. Speaker. we cannot afford to not afford to fund the Chicago State University. We must do everything in our power to address this ominous situation and provide help to this critical institution that has proven to be so vital to the needs of my constituents. to the needs of the citizens of the State of Illinois. and to our Nation as a whole. We must act. and we must act now. Save Chicago State. Save Chicago State. Save Chicago State University. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140089366,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today because. despite our best efforts. racial redlining is still alive and well today. I come to this Chamber because racial redlining has once again reared its ugly. evil head across our Nation. Mr. Speaker. on April 21. Bloomberg published an analysis entitled ""Amazon Doesnt Consider the Race of Its Customers. Should It?"" Bloomberg explains how amazon.com discriminates against mostly African American communities nationwide by shutting them out. shutting them off from receiving its Prime free sameday delivery service. Mr. Speaker. it must be understood that mostly predominantly African American ZIP Codes in this Nation have been excluded from receiving Amazons Prime free sameday delivery service. It must be understood. Mr. Speaker. that this is absolutely unacceptable. Amazons vice president for global communications. Mr. Craig Berman. feebly attempted to justify this by saying that ""demographics play no role"" in the determination by which neighborhoods have access to Prime free sameday service. He goes on to state that distance matters and that in terms of determining factors. close proximity to a warehouse is certainly one of the factors that they consider. Well. Mr. Speaker. on the face of it. that seemingly appears to be both logical and understandable. However. when viewed through a sharper lens. there are some glaring. flagrant inconsistencies. In my hometown of Chicago. Illinois. just for example. sameday service is available to a majority of the city and its surrounding suburbs. This free. sameday delivery service is not available to my constituents in predominantly African American ZIP Codes. Mr. Berman. the article explains. again. feebly blames this on the distance of these ZIP Codes from a distribution center that is located in Kenosha. Wisconsin. That would be understandable if not for the fact that this free. sameday Amazon delivery service is available to residents in Oak Lawn. Illinois. which is a community that is also in the district that I represent. but Oak Lawn is even farther south. farther away from Kenosha. Wisconsin. a greater distance from the distribution center in Kenosha. Wisconsin. than all these African Americanpredominant ZIP Codes. Mr. Speaker. because I live in a predominantly African American ZIP Code. I cannot be served by the Amazon Prime free. sameday delivery service. but my White constituents can be served by Amazon with their Prime free. sameday delivery service. Simply put. Mr. Speaker. despite amazon.coms assertions of impartiality and a strictly numbersbased approach to the availability of this Prime free. sameday delivery services. Amazons implementation of this service has been disparate. disappointing. disgusting. and apparently discriminatory. Mr. Speaker. not only does this occur in the city of Chicago. but also Bloomberg found similar situations existing in five other cities. Not just Chicago. but Atlanta. Boston. Dallas. New York City. and Washington. D.C.. all across our great Nation. Mr. Speaker. historically and unfortunately. the situation with amazon.com is not a unique experience for people of color. Today. in the year 2016. too many Americans still are denied services and access to goods based off the color of their skin and where they reside or the location of their ZIP Code. This is redlining. This practice is known as redlining. This redlining has been a major. significant obstacle to communities of color to gain access to the fullness of their American Dream. to the fullness of their American ideal. For decades now. despite efforts during the civil rights era of our Nation. during similar efforts. not only before. but even after the civil rights era of our Nation. despite many multiple legislative attempts to stamp redlining out. this very injustice continues to spread. even among some of my corporate citizens who. on the face of it. would never accept the fact that they engage in discriminatory business practices. But when you look at it from my perspective. look at it from my vantage point. look at it from the experience of my constituents who are African American. Amazon fails to meet the acid test. Its Prime sameday delivery service is far less than prime for too many of my constituents and too many American citizens. Mr. Speaker. Members of this body of the U.S. House of Representatives. we cannot allow businesses in this country to discriminate against any particular group of Americans. We cannot allow businesses in this country to discriminate against neighborhoods. against communities based on their businesss racebased perceptions. Mr. Speaker. this body. this U.S. House of Representatives cannot allow the Amazons of the world. amazon.com to violate laws of our Nation. laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Amazon cannot violate the laws of our Nation with impunity and without accountability. Mr. Speaker. I must call upon amazon.com and its CEO. Jeff Bezos. to come and do what is right. to come and right this wrong. Make Amazons Prime sameday delivery service a prime service that is available to all the citizens of this Nation and not just to the White citizens of this Nation. People all across this Nation like amazon.com. I am a customer of amazon.com. and amazon.com benefits from Black Americans dollars because Black Americans dollars are just as green as any other Americans dollars. White Americans dollars are not more powerful. arent colder or hotter. These are Americans dollars. greenbacks. and Amazon must respect the buying power. the consumer right of African American consumers just as it does all other American consumers. Mr. Bezos. again. I appeal to you. do what is right and right this wrong. Mr. Speaker. I must call upon our colleagues in the executive branch to ensure that the laws of our Nation passed by this U.S. Congress are faithfully and equally executed so that communities of color get equal and fair treatment by its corporate citizens all across this country. Redlining is an evil that has ripped apart the dreams and the aspirations of African American citizens and other minorities. It is high time now. The hour has passed. It is time now to put redlining and all the vestiges of it aside. buried deep. Take it out of the consciousness of the corporate decisionmakers in this Nation. Mr. Speaker. our economy is a service economy. Our economics are based on service. Our social contract means that all Americans should have access and a level playing field when it comes to getting service and being serviced in this service economy. Now. amazon.coms Prime sameday delivery service stands as a stark example of how much still needs to be changed in our society. No matter how much things change. so much remains the same. Let us rise up to the call. Amazon. do what is right. and right this wrong. Mr. Speaker. we can do no less than our best for all American citizens. This is an extraordinary violation of not only the civil rights laws of our Nation. but it stands as a significant barrier to greater economic opportunities. to a greater sense of being treated equally and fairly. There is something called justice in our society. and any injustice must be courageously confronted. Any injustice. Amazon.com. your Prime sameday delivery service is not so prime until all your customers are treated fairly and equitably in your business model. No excuses. This is shameful. It must be corrected. Make the Amazon Prime sameday delivery service available for all Americans because we live in a society where being prime really should mean somethingthis America that we live in. Mr. Speaker. again. I call upon Mr. Jeff Bezos. Amazons CEO. to do what is right and right this less than prime wrong. Mr. Speaker. I include in the RECORD the article: ""Amazon Doesnt Consider the Race of Its Customers. Should It?"" [From www.bloomberg.com. Apr. 21. 2016]"

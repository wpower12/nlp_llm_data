1130006764,Madam President. I would like to thank and compliment the Senator from Oklahoma. who has been a terrific leader and ally. I appreciate his hard work and the work product we have come up with. At the end of the day. it is not complicated. It is pretty simple. Do we go ahead with indiscriminate acrosstheboard cuts that give us no ability whatsoever to establish priorities. to recognize that some spending is more important than others. or do we adopt this flexibility approach and give to the President of the United States the flexibility for him to turn to his service chiefs and say to them: Folks. is there a better way to do this? I am sure they know best what their needs are. I am sure they can come up with a better set of spending cuts than these acrosstheboard cuts that are in law. Similarly. on the nondefense side. any competent middle manager of any business in America knows that when they have to tighten their belt. they go through and prioritize. So when the President and the Secretary of Transportation go around the country saying: Oh. we are going to have to lay off air traffic controllers. we are going to have to shut down towers. we are going to have delays. none of it is necessary. It is not necessary if we pass this legislation because it would give the President the flexibility to cut the items that would not be disruptive to our economy. and it would not be disruptive in any meaningful way. I gave the example earlier of the FAA. The FAA would have more money postsequester than what the President even asked for. Obviously. what the President needs is the discretion to be able to make some cuts where they can be best be borne. After having a total budget that has grown 100 percent over the last 12 years. we can find the 2.3 percent that is needed now. These are flexibility measures we would give the President for the remainder of this fiscal year. Thereafter. the savings we will achieve will happen through the spending caps and. therefore. will be decided by the Appropriations Committee. I urge my colleagues to support the Republican alternative. I yield the floor.
1130015202,Mr. President. the last point I wish to make is something about the NICS system that I should have mentioned. that is. currently there are States in which someone can be adjudicated as mentally ill. for instance. but that person is left with very few options to challenge that status. That is the current situation. We remedy that. One of the things we require in this bill. in the 4year plan States have to develop. is that it has to include a program. a mechanism by which a person who feels they have been wrongly designated as someone who cant own a firearm by virtue of their criminal background or their mental health would have an opportunity to challenge that. as they should. There ought to be a process they can go through to challenge that finding so that nobody who doesnt belong on this list ends up on this list. Let me move on to the background checks at gun shows. I am going to introduce this by reading a letter I received from a constituent yesterday. This happens to be a woman whom I know very well. I have known her for years. She is a conservative Republican. as it happens. She is a second amendment gun owner. Let me read what she wrote: Hello. Pat. I just had to write after watching your leadership with this very difficult issue. I very much understand what you are doing with the gun show checks and appreciate your dealing with this. This issue is very personal to me and if you will indulge me. I will tell you. She goes on to say: Im a very strong supporter of the second amendment. Im the gun owner in my house. I do shoot. My father very proudly passed down his Remington 1100 to me several years before he passed away. He presented it to me with great pride. I accepted it as a very special moment between us. Meanwhile. Pat. I have an adopted daughter who has had emotional troubles her entire life. Much of our journey with her has been difficult and it continues to this day. My daughter has been involuntarily committed twice. and I unfortunately believe that it wont be the last time. as she refuses to get proper treatment. I was the one who had to sign her paperwork the first time. And it was made clear to me that I would be taking away her right to own a gun. I knew that we had no choice but to try and get her some help. But my hands shook and I had to pause quite a long time over that document. because I so strongly believe in our second amendment rights. Nevertheless. I signed it and I would do it again today. At various times. people have been concerned for our safety with the volatile nature of my daughters problems. The idea that she would be able to purchase a weapon openly in a public venue is not acceptable. I do not believe that she actually would. but I dont find any comfort in the fact that she could have an avenue if she so chose. Once again. I cannot emphasize the importance of the second amendment to me enough. Pat. I thank you for your efforts in D.C. and bless you for all that youre doing. Be well and be strong. I think that says a lot about what we are trying to accomplish. Here we have a passionate supporter of the second amendment. a gun owner. someone who has always been a believer in the second amendment. For reasons that she has explained very personally. very important reasons. she does not want her daughter to be able to go into a gun show and buy a firearm without so much as a background check. Since the mom has the recognition of her daughters problems. if the information is provided and if that State compliesin this case it is my State of Pennsylvaniawith this background check system. then someone in the circumstances of her daughter attempting to buy a weapon at a gun show would be denied. I think that is the outcome we all want. It is certainly the outcome her own mother wants. who loves her dearly and loves the second amendment. I would yield back to the Senator from West Virginia.
1130015212,"The Senator makes a point which may seem basic. This bill has been available online since Thursday night. It is available now and in every detail. It is available in summary form and available in any way people choose to look at it. The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. one of the pro second amendment rights groups which endorses this bill. states: If you read the ManchinToomey substitute amendment. you can see all the advances for our cause. that it contains. This ""cause"" refers to defense of the second amendment. which it contains. The bottom line is. as the Senator from Montana pointed out. our amendment isnt gun control. This is very clear. and I think it is an important contrast. There are other Members of this body who are not happy with this bill because they want active. aggressive gun control. For instance. they want to ban various categories of weapons. They wish to ban various categories of ammunition. They would like to ban various kinds of waiting periods and put other restrictions on lawabiding citizens. This is gun control. Restricting the freedom of lawabiding citizens who have never done anything to harm anyone and restricting their second amendment rights is gun control. I disagree with it. I oppose it. I will oppose every such amendment which comes before this body. Trying to keep guns out of the hands of people who arent legally entitled to have themdangerous people. be they criminals or dangerously mentally ill peoplethat is not gun control. this is common sense. As I started off my comments. there is no dispute this is not an infringement on the second amendment. Our Founders didnt think so. Our Supreme Court Justices didnt think so. The laws in 50 States dont maintain this. It is common sense. I wish to point out another difference in the approach Senator MANCHIN and I have taken versus some others in this body have taken. Others have said lets make a universal background check. and then we will think about who to make an exception for. Then they carve out very narrow categories. One of the problems with that. in my view. is we will not imagine every sort of set of circumstances we ought to carve out. We took a different approach. We said private transactions generally dont need to be subject to this. I am not going to try to imagine every conceivable private transaction. We said lets have background checks on commercial transactions. This is where the big volume of commercial transactions occur and where strangers are buying and selling guns from each other. This is why we require the background check at gun shows. and we require the background check on Internet sales. The private transaction. whether it is with a family member. friends. neighbors or colleagues. if it doesnt happen at a gun show and doesnt happen over the Internet. it is not subject to the background check. We thought that would be an unnecessary burden on people who know each other. Let me just run through quickly some of the ways in which this legislation strengthens the ability of lawabiding citizens to exercise their second amendment rights. I will do this briefly. The Senator from Montana touched on some of these. I ought to start off underscoring something the Senator from West Virginia mentioned earlier. Not only will this not in any way contribute to any kind of national registry. it is explicitly forbidden. Anybody in the Federal Government who did try to create a Federal registry would become a felon and subject to 15 years in prison. This is point No. 1. One of the problems we have heard from our constituents who are gun enthusiasts. which we were able to address in this legislation. is clarifying and fixing interstate travel laws such as for sportsmen who are traveling long distances. Unfortunately. it happens too frequently when a sportsman is traveling from one State to another State. perhaps on a hunting trip or going home for Christmas and wishes to give a relative a gun for a present. He is perfectly. lawfully entitled to own this gun. He is following the rules and regulations in his State. He packs the gun appropriately in his vehicle. As he is traveling through another State. he discovers he is not in compliance with the other State. People have gotten themselves into trouble. They have not done anything to harm anybody. they are just traveling into a State which has a whole different regime and doesnt respect the regime of the other State. We fixed that by clarifying in the legislation if a person is transiting through a State and in compliance with the laws of their home State. they are OK. We permit interstate handgun sales from dealers. We provideand this is very important. the Senator from Montana mentioned thisa legal process for restoring veterans second amendment rights. We have a problem in this country right now for veterans. They come back after serving this country. risking their lives. often sustaining injuries. sustaining trauma. They can go to the VA and have a social worker decide they are not able to handle their personal financial matters. This alone puts them on the registry. disqualifies them from being able to own a firearm legally and be able to purchase one. I think this is outrageous. frankly. This is currently happening every day to veterans. We deal with that. We change the system. Under our legislation. this couldnt happen. Before anybody at the VA could designate a veteran as somebody who cant own a firearm. first they would need to inform the veteran 30 days in advance to give the veteran an opportunity to challenge the status. This is only fair. We owe that to those men and women who have given so much to us. This is in our bill. We also have a policy today where the law of the land forbids an ActiveDuty military person from buying a gun in his home State. I dont know whose idea this was. It doesnt make any sense to me. This is the law. We repeal the policy in this bill to enable a man or woman serving in uniform in this country to buy a firearm in their home State. We also allow a person who has a concealed carry permit to use the permit as the mechanism by which they are approved for a gun sale. This stands to reason. The concealed carry permit process is itself a very cumbersome and onerous process. In many cases it is very thorough and very expensive. If someone passes that they should be fine. We have it in this bill as well. I wish to underscore that these are the reasons two of the leading pro second amendment groups have endorsed this bill. It enhances the opportunity of lawabiding citizens to exercise their second amendment rights. If someone is a criminal or mentally unqualified to have a firearm. they are not going to like this bill. As I said at the beginning. I feel very strongly about this. It is not gun control to try to keep guns out of the hands of people who are not qualified to have them. I. again. wish to thank the Senator from West Virginia. my friend. I appreciate the hard work he has put into this. I appreciate the chance to share these thoughts and work with him. We will welcome any questions. comments. ideas or suggestions from our colleagues as we wrestle with this bill in the coming days and. hopefully. have a vote soon which will be successful on this amendment."
1130024802,Madam President. I rise to make a unanimous consent request. We have been following an extraordinary horror story in the news. and it is the story of Kermit Gosnells truly unspeakable crimes that were committed over a long period of timemaybe as long as two decadesat the Womens Medical Society in Philadelphia. PA. We suspect there were literally hundreds of lateterm and very lateterm abortions that were conducted there. and we now know from his conviction in a criminal trial that there were babies born aliveprobably manywho were then murdered when scissors were used to sever their spinal cords after they were born alive in a failed abortion attempt. Further. we know that Kermit Gosnell and some of his colleagues kept aborted fetuses in bags and bottles. discarded them. left them on shelves. It is unbelievable what was happening at that place for years and years. In fact. the crimes were discovered by accident. Police raided offices to seize evidence of illegal sales of prescription drugs. It was only during that raid for illegal prescription drug sales that they discovered the evidence of these atrocities. It is my view and the view of many of my colleagues that we need to do a lot more to make sure that the laws. which were blatantly being violated by Kermit Gosnell. are better enforced. We need to do that through proper due diligence and discover where they are being violated. About 2 weeks ago Kermit Gosnell was convicted. He was convicted of three counts of firstdegree murder for killing three infants. He was convicted of one count of thirddegree murder in the overdose death of a woman. There were 21 counts of abortion of an unborn child of 24 weeks or more. and he was convicted of 208 counts of violation of informed consent. We have a resolution. S. Res. 133. It points to these atrocities that were committed. It simply calls on Congress and the States to investigate and correct the abusive. unsanitary. and the blatantly illegal abortion practices that certainly were conducted here at the Womens Medical Society in Philadelphia and similar such practices that may be occurring in other places. I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 133. that the Senate proceed to its consideration. and that the resolution be agreed to. the preamble be agreed to. and the motion to reconsider be made and laid on the table. with no intervening action or debate.
1130029974,"Mr. President. I wish to offer my full support for the nomination of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo to serve as U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Before I begin. I wish to take this opportunity to thank Chairman LEAHY and Senator GRASSLEY for helping facilitate Judge Restrepos confirmation hearing and Leader REID and Leader MCCONNELL for their assistance in bringing his nomination to the Senate floor. I would also like to thank Senator CASEY for his collaboration in our bipartisan effort to fill Pennsylvanias judicial vacancies with exceptional candidates. Over the past 212 years. we have worked together to identify and recommend eight candidates. seven of whom have been confirmed. The people of Pennsylvania value this bipartisan spirit and I am pleased our joint efforts have led to todays consideration of Judge Restrepo. Judge Restrepo currently serves as a Federal magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. A native of Columbia. he was raised in Northern Virginia and received his citizenship in 1993. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. he went on to earn his J.D. from Tulane School of Law. Judge Restrepo brings a strong record as an attorney in both the public and private sector. which helps explain why he merited a unanimous ""Well Qualified"" rating from the American Bar Association. After working as a public defender. he then practiced law at the law firm of Krasner & Restrepo. focusing on criminal defense and civil rights litigation. After 13 years in the private sector. Judge Restrepo was selected to be a Federal magistrate judge and has served the public in this capacity for 7 years. Aside from his legal duties. Judge Restrepo has devoted significant time to his community. In addition to his involvement with the MakeAWish Foundation. he established the Police/ Barrio project. which focuses on improving the relationship between the Police Department and Latino Community in Philadelphia. I am very confident that Judge Restrepos judicial experience. legal acumen. and dedication to public service will serve him well should he be confirmed for the Federal bench. I am pleased to support this highly qualified nominee and I urge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation.*"
1130059834,"Mr. President. I rise today to address an amendment I have pending on the ENDA bill which we will vote on soon. This is an amendment I have offered on my own behalf and that of Senators FLAKE and MCCAIN. who have joined me in this effort. and I thank them for that. It occurs to me that sometimes in our work a tension can arise between important competing American values. and two vitally important American values are. I believe. somewhat in tension in some aspects of this bill. First. one great enduring and important value for all Americans is equality. This bill today clearly makes a strong stand for greater equality. I believe. and I think most Americans share the view. that every individual is entitled to dignity and respect and fairness. and that individuals ought to be judged based on their merits. on their character. and on their abilities. A persons sexual orientation is irrelevant to their ability to be a good doctor or engineer or athlete or a Federal judge. That is why I have supported acknowledging that reality. I supported 17 years ago. in the writing of the charter of the city government of Allentown. a provision that would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the hiring for that city. I supported an end to dont ask. dont tell. because I thought it was an inappropriate infringement on the freedom of gay and lesbian persons serving in the military. I believe there are more legal protections that are appropriate to prevent employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. So these are an important set of values. Another obvious and vitally important American value is freedom. and particularly religious freedom. The First Amendment guarantee of the free exercise of religion means that religious groups. even in the course of secular services. can. for instance. choose to hire employees who agree with their religion. employees who will promote that religion. And of course. the First Amendment applies even when we dont necessarily agree with the views of that religion or that faith. What we have tried to do in this legislation and in other context is to strike an appropriate balance between the tension that arises between these sometimes competing values. The sponsors of this bill have made a very thoughtful. credible effort to strike that balance. In fact. the sponsor of this bill and I agree on what at least an important aspect of that important balance ought to look like. and specifically I believe the agreement is that religious institutions. including those engaging in some secular activities. should be exempt from the requirements of this bill if it violates the tenets of their faith. The goal of my amendment is to simply make sure the bill actually achieves what the drafters intended. The Senator from Oregon. who is the chief sponsor of the bill. has stated correctly. in terms of its intent. that the bill ""broadly exempts from its scope houses of worship as well as religiously affiliated organizations."" This exemption. which covers the same religious organizations already exempted from the religious discrimination provisions of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should ensure that religious freedom concerns do not hinder the passage of this critical legislation. Other groups that are advocates for this legislation have similarly observed that the provisions of title VII would ensure the exemption of faithbased institutions. There are examples where circuit courts have ruled. in interpreting title VII of the Civil Rights Act. that affiliated organizations would in fact get this exemption. Examples include a gymnasium run by the Mormon Church. Christian elementary schools and universities. a Presbyterianoperated retirement home. a Seventh Day Adventist hospital. a Jewish community center. and there are others. So I acknowledge it is absolutely true it is the case there are Federal courts that have respected the religious freedom of these institutions to be exempted from the religious hiring mandates of the Civil Rights Act and. presumably. that would apply in the case of ENDA because of the way the legislation is crafted. The problem that concerns me is that there are other cases where other courts have come to a different conclusion. and they have not recognized religious institutions the same way. There is a lack of uniformity across our country. across the different districts that ultimately interpret the application of title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In fact. over the years. different courts have interpreted the language quite differently. and so we have these two problems. in my view. if we leave the underlying legislation as it is. One is that Americans will live under not two but multiple different standards. The 12 circuits that apply the title VII exemptions have already adopted four different tests for determining whether an institution qualifies for the religious exemption. The second problem is that employers and workers dont necessarily have predictability even within a circuit that has its own test. which differs from another circuit. And the reason is the tests themselves are somewhat subjective and somewhat unpredictable. They have multiple factors. For example. the Third Circuit. which includes my State of Pennsylvania. has nine factors. and as the court explained. not all factors will be relevant in all cases. and the weight given each factor may vary from case to case. The result is that in a single case decisionmakers looking at the same set of facts can reach very different conclusions. In the absence of my amendment. my concern is there will be no uniform. predictable national standard for determining when a religious entity. a religious organization. is exempt from the bill. There are a couple of examples that illustrate my point. In a case called the EEOC v. Kamehameha Schoolsthat is a Hawaiian word. My pronunciation may not be correct. This is a 1993 decisionthere were two schools created by a charitable trust to help orphans and poor children. The trust instructed ""the teachers . . . shall forever be persons of the Protestant religion."" The schools shall provide a good education ""and also instruction in morals."" The schools hired only Protestant teachers. They held themselves out as Protestant schools. They required all the students to take religious classes. They offered Bible studies and worship services. and they had a cooperative relationship with one specific Protestant church. The district court found the schools were religious and. therefore. they were covered and they qualified for the exemption. But the Ninth Circuit Court. considering the exact same set of facts. found the opposite and decided the schools were secular. The Ninth Circuit acknowledged the schools original principle was providing religious instruction. but they essentially ruled that since some students were not Protestant and since the schools offered courses that were not religious in naturethe schools taught math and they taught social studiesfor those reasons they would not qualify for the exemption and the schools were required to hire nonProtestant teachers. Another exampleand I only have twois a Methodist orphanage founded by the Methodist Church. The board of trustees were Methodist and they had close ties to the Methodist Church. The district court eventually held that many of the orphanages daytoday activities of caring for children were simply not necessarily religious. and so the home was not exempt. But initially. the district court had actually found for the Methodist orphanage. It was the Fourth Circuit that reversed it. sent the case back with instructions they reconsider this. The district court had an interesting comment in this. It stated its opinion by declaring that it remains somewhat confused as to the proper interpretation. but it would do its best. So if a Federal judge cant tell what the test is. how could workers? How could an employer? How could an institution based on faith? My amendment really is a modest attempt to ensure the bill actually achieves what I believe its authors and sponsors and supporters intend. It would continue to guarantee equality to workers. but it would protect religious groups rights to the free exercise of their religion. And it would ensure all Americans would live under the same rule. the same formulation. with predictability and certainty. It would clarify that ENDAs religious exemption applies to religious hospitals. schools. charities. and other organizations that are owned by. controlled by. or officially affiliated with a church or religious group covered by ENDAs current exemption. What this does is simply ensures we get close to striking a good. sensible balance between the equality in the workforce that is the principle motivation for this bill and the religious freedom I feel very strongly about and I think many of my colleagues do as well. I want to commend everybody who has put in a lot of hard work on a careful and thoughtful effort here. and I hope my fellow Senators will join me in supporting this amendment. Mr. President. I yield the floor."
1130073578,"Madam President. today I wish to recognize the Pittsburgh Opera. the seventh oldest opera company in the United States. The Pittsburgh Opera is currently engaged in its 75th season. and I would like to congratulate them on this momentous anniversary. The company started in 1939 when five ambitious women were determined to bring opera to their community. Within a year. these women had assembled musicians. singers. sets. costumes. and lighting. and produced the opera companys first performance. Offenbachs ""The Tales of Hoffman"" at Carnegie Music Hall. Before long. the Pittsburgh Opera Society. under the leadership of general director Dr. Richard Karp. had become a fully professional organization. The Pittsburgh Opera is not only recognized as an asset to southwestern Pennsylvania. but it is known throughout the international opera community for the fine skill and artistry of its productions. It has welcomed numerous celebrity vocalists over the years. and the companys notoriety only continues to grow and attract more talent. I believe that the Pittsburgh Opera has been undeniably successful in fulfilling its stated mission ""to culturally enrich Pittsburgh and the tristate area. and to draw national and international attention to the region."" and I think that the 31.000 Pittsburghers and visitors who attend the operas productions annually would agree. The Pittsburgh Opera is also dedicated to fostering the development of future opera talent. The company has established and nurtured a resident artist program that ranks among the top five in the country and has the distinction of being the only program in the United States that trains singers as well as stage directors. These artists present two fully staged productions of their own and also develop a variety of general music programs to perform at public schools. community centers. and libraries. Six years ago. after nearly 70 years without its own center. the Pittsburgh Opera acquired and renovated the original home of the George A. Westinghouse Air Brake Co. in Pittsburghs historic Strip District and transformed it into a stateoftheart home for the development and production of opera. This structure is the oldest LEEDcertified building in Pittsburg. and it is a fitting home for an opera company with such a rich history and a promising future. Again. I want to recognize the Pittsburgh Opera on its 75th anniversary. I wish them nothing but success in the next 75 years."
1130102727,Madam President. I wish to recognize Little League International on its 75th anniversary. Little League International was founded in Williamsport. PA. in 1939 by Carl Stotz as a means for area youth to learn the sport at a time when they were considered too young to play organized baseball. The basic goal of Little League was. and remains. to introduce children to a game that teaches its set of values. including courage. character and loyalty. that will guide them throughout their lives. Congress recognized the valuable role Little League has played in Americas communities when it unanimously granted Little League a Federal charter on July 16. 1964. That charter was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson the very next day. Over the course of its 75 years. Little League Baseball has become the worlds largest organized youth sports program. growing from 3 teams in 1939 to nearly 200.000 teams located in all 50 States and more than 80 countries worldwide. Each year. more than 2.4 million children participate in Little League Baseball in various divisions. including baseball. softball. and a challenger division for physically and developmentally challenged children. Some notable Little League alumni include former U.S. President George W. Bush. two Vice Presidents. numerous U.S. Senators and Representatives. two Nobel Prize laureates. and a Medal of Honor recipient. Also. several professional athletes and Hall of Fame baseball players began their journey in Little League. In keeping with the tradition of our national pastime. thousands of games are played throughout the summer months at various levels of competition. These events bring together children from the international community and foster principles that transcend cultural or regional differences. Since the very first game was played on June 6. 1939. Little League International has made an invaluable contribution to the lives of millions of children across the globe. I wish Little League International all the best as it continues to grow and fulfill its mission by laying a strong foundation for todays youth.
1130117938,"Mr. President. I comment today on an issue of tremendous concern to a number of Pennsylvania families who in recent years adopted children from Nepal. In August of 2010. the State Department suspended the authorization for American families to adopt children from that nation with the exception of those families. some from Pennsylvania. who were already in the process of adopting Nepali orphans. The State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told these ""pipeline"" families that their cases would be processed to completion. but that they should anticipate significant delays and possibly negative outcomes. since their cases were suspected of being heavily tainted by fraud. corruption. and illegal or unethical practices. In response to U.S. government requests for additional evidence substantiating the legality and morality of these adoptions. these families had to undertake extensive investigations on their own to provide such evidence. Since these families were already completely bonded with their adoptive children. each of them eagerly undertook its investigation. at great financial and emotional expense. Meanwhile. most of the children were forced to languish for an additional 6 months in orphanages. While due diligence is appropriate for all adoptions. I am deeply troubled that in this case not a single instance of fraud or corruption was ever found. In fact. the State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ultimately allowed all these American pipeline families bring their children home to the United States. Despite this ultimately successful outcome. the State Department continues to suspend adoption of desperate Nepali children by American families. I ask that the Department reevaluate its policy with the recent experience of the pipeline families as a major consideration. With an eye towards the future of the children who were adopted by the pipeline families. I am concerned that the public record on these adoptions from Nepal is still replete with references to fraud and trafficking. We need to set the record straight and to make it clear that each of the Nepali pipeline adoption cases in progress at the time of the suspension was ultimately approved and was devoid of any findings of malfeasance. Every child deserves a family and no child deserves to be needlessly haunted by clouds of doubt about his or her origin. These American families deserve to have a positive public record created showing that their adoptions were completely legal and ethical. I wish to personally begin that record today.*"

1130005392,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. SAM JOHNSON is an American hero. and everybody in this House knows that. Hes an American hero for all kinds of ways that he served this country. Many of the people here are going to talk about those ways. and every one of them are important. I read SAMs book. Its an awesome book. It makes you cry at points. it makes you struggle. But it also expresses the kind of a man and. quite frankly. the kind of a family SAM JOHNSON has. SAM was a guy with a broken leg. dislocated shoulders. who looked them straight in the eye and spit in their face and told them to take their best shot. And he suffered for it. he suffered unmercifully for it. but he never gave in to the enemy. He always stood his ground. to his detriment. and it harmed him in so many physical ways. And yet the thing that makes me always tear up is you read the part of the book where SAM steps off that plane. when we finally repatriated our prisoners. and saluted and said. Colonel SAM JOHNSON reporting for duty. sir. And SAM reports for duty. People say. Who do you want to have your back in a foxhole? But people also say. Who do you want to have your back in Congress? I want SAM JOHNSON to have my back in Congress. Hes a friend. Hes one of my best friends in this Congress. Ive gotten to know him very well. He and I go to a Christian retreat together almost every year. And thats one of the things you notice from the book. SAM didnt talk about himself. He talked about when they took him out and he thought. This time theyre going to shoot me. He prayed to God that he could stand there and be a man. And they went. Ready. aim. fire. click. and one more time they didnt shoot him. And at that time he thanked God and his Savior. because he knew he had witnessed a miracle. Meanwhile. his sweet wife was praying and fighting on the home front because she didnt know. She got very little news about what was going on in SAMs life. but she never gave up because her faith strengthened her. And thats part of the theme of that book that you need to pick up and read. that their faith strengthened them in trials that none of us can ever imagine. SAM JOHNSON is a hero. not just because of what went on in Vietnam and what our enemy did to him. Hes a hero because he comes here every day and he fights for the people of his district and for the State and for this country. Hes willing to take a risk and step out. even now after all the years of service. both legislatively and in the Congress. SAM JOHNSON is one who is willing to step out and take the shots. I was once asked by ""60 Minutes"" to define what a leader is. and I said. Well. Im just a history guy who reads history. I always thought in the First World War how hard it would have been to come out of those trenches and charge those machine guns with a boltaction rifle. and that the officers who climbed out in front and said. ""Lets go. boys. lets go get em."" were the heroes. and the guys that stayed in the bottom and said. ""You go get er. boys."" they were not heroes. And a special hero is one who says. ""Im going first and Ill take the shots."" Theres plenty of shots to be had in this Chamber. and those are political shots. But Im proud to say that that same hero that spit in the enemys face. SAM JOHNSON. is still willing to stand up and take the shots in Congress. And for that reason. I today honor my good friend SAM JOHNSON and tell him I want him to keep taking care of my back. because I need it real bad. God bless you. SAM. Youre my friend."
1130026400,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. It was 69 years ago this Thursday that more than 9.000 Allied soldiers were killed or wounded during the Dday invasion in Normandy. France. That courageous operation. as well as the sacrifice of so many brave individuals. serves as a sobering reminder that freedom and security are. in fact. not free. It is with this solemn commitment to both freedom and security that I respectfully present to the peoples House the fiscal year 2014 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Similar to our subcommittees work over the past 3 fiscal years. this bill demonstrates how we can fund vital security programs and enforce the law while also reducing discretionary spending overall. So this bill is about our security and fiscal priorities and getting them right. The Presidents fiscal year 2014 budget proposal for DHS presents a harmful budget for our frontline homeland security agencies. diminishing their operational workforces and undermining mission capabilities. The end result of the Presidents budget proposal would. undoubtedly. be a less capable DHS. Thats why our subcommittee. on a bipartisan basis. strove to significantly improve the flawed budget request through this bill before the House today. First. this bill targets the very programs and systems displayed during and after the recent horrific attack at the Boston Marathon. It does this by a nearly 20 percent increase above the request for FEMAs first responder grants. substantial increases above the request and last years level for CBPs targeting. TSAs Secure Flight. and ICEs visa enforcement programs. including the phasein of 1.600 additional CBP officers. doubling the Departments Bombing Prevention program. substantially increasing counterIED training and applying the lessons learned from our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. and a nearly 40 percent increase in the program If You See Something. Say Something. In addition. the bill restores virtually all of the unjustified proposed cuts to DHS operational programs. to include restoring the cuts to ICEs mandated 34.000 detention beds and vital investigative programs. restoring cuts to the Coast Guards operational expenses. including aviation and flight hours. as well as restoring the Presidents truly harmful cuts to recapitalization and acquisitions of cutter and aviation assets. restoring the proposed cuts to CBP air and marine operating hours and procurement. as well as mission support functions. restoring the proposed longterm cuts to Secret Service staffing and financial crime investigations. and providing these restorations while also strongly supporting the Departments disaster relief. cybersecurity and research programs. including the fullyear construction increment for the National Agroand BioDefense facility in Kansas. This bill also considers our Nations fiscal crisis by invoking real fiscal discipline and efficiency. including a more than $613 millionor more than 1.5 percentreduction below fiscal year 2013 to the Departments annual budget. a 15 percent cut below the request to DHS headquarters staffing. a nearly 25 percent cut below the request to departmental administrative expenses and bureaucratic overhead. denial of the Presidents request to increase bureaucracy by creating three new headquarters offices. termination of funding for ineffectual offices and programs and substantial oversight requirements. ranging from withholding funds to statutory mandates to reporting requirements on everything from major acquisitions to ammunition inventories. purchases. and usage. Mr. Chairman. this bill does not represent a false choice between fiscal responsibility and security. Both are urgent priorities. and both are vigorously addressed by this bill. I must note that DHS did a shameful job in complying with statutory requirements enacted into law FY13. Those failures are certainly addressed in this bill. We are serious about compelling the Department to both enforce the law and comply with the law. and we will not tolerate further failures in this regard. a point I think we make clear in this bill through 50 percent withholdings to the Departments executive offices and 50 percent reductions to offices that are delaying the review and submittal of needed. factual information requested by Congress. On a final and regrettably sober note. my staff and I have been regularly talking with our dear friend and my classmate. TOM COLE. and doing all that we can to help the good people of his Oklahoma district get back on their feet from the devastating tornado that hit the town of Moore and surrounding communities. So. in addition to the nearly $11 billion that is currently in FEMA coffers. this bill fully supports the known requirements of $6.2 billion for the disaster relief fund in FY14. These funds. combined with our continued oversight. will help ensure disaster assistance rapidly gets to those whove lost so much. Mr. Chairman. we send TOM and his constituents our sincere condolences and wish them a speedy recovery. In closing. let me first thank Ranking Member PRICE for his statesmanship and partnership. I sincerely thank him and his dedicated professional staff for their input and notable contributions to this bill. In addition. let me thank the thoughtful Members of this body. We received program submissions from 222 Members. and their input was critical to our oversight work over the past few months. as well as the production of this bill. I know that my staff and I made every effort to accommodate virtually every Members submission we received. and that has only made this a stronger product. Finally. I must thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the full committee. Chairman ROGERS and Mrs. LOWEY. Their input and support for the bill is genuinely appreciated. I sincerely believe this bill reflects our best effort to address our Nations urgent needs: security. enforcement. and fiscal restraint. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1130026516,I rise in opposition to this amendment. which strikes the legal requirement for 34.000 detention beds. The simple fact is that sovereign countries control their borders and have an immigration system with integrity that adheres to the rule of law. This last Friday. I visited the ICE facility in Houston. Texas. I find it interesting the numbers that they explained to me that were going on today in the HoustonCorpus Christi region. which takes in the entire gulf coast of Texas along with what we call the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. They informed me that we are having a massive encroachment into our country from across the border right now of approximately 100 OTMs a day in addition to the Mexicans who are coming across the border. Its interesting that we talk as to the alternatives to incarceration. In the Houston office alone. 64.000plus are on alternatives to incarceration. which is almost double the number of detention beds for the entire United States in one office. So I think. with this. we get a better picture of what this invasion is all about. The attacks of 9111 taught us that immigration enforcement matters. It matters to our security. The Boston Marathon attacks underscored this sobering lesson. Each year. more than 1 million aliens attempt to illegally enter the United States without proper documentation. or they enter legally but overstay and violate their visas. Though reasonable people can disagree. I believe detention beds are a critical component in enforcing U.S. immigration laws with the detention and eventual removal of those aliens who enter this country illegally. Therefore. the bill recommends $2.8 billion to fully fund ICEs obligation to maintain no fewer than 34.000 beds. In contrast. the Presidents request provided funds sufficient to support 31.800 beds. justifying the request by saying theres no need to support 34.000 detention beds. even though. as I speak today. those in detention are at 38.000 beds. So it looks like weve got overage. not shortage. The facts. however. refute this completely. First. as of last Friday. more than 38.000 illegal immigrants are being held in ICE custody. many of whom meet the mandatory detention requirements. Second. by the administrations own estimate. theres at least 1.9 million removable criminal aliens in the United States. There is general acknowledgement of an illegal alien population of approximately 11 million. That estimate goes up to as high as 20 million in some quarters. Clearly. detention beds are necessary. This bed mandate is needed. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time.
1130026526,I have listened to the arguments from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. and I find it interesting. First. those who cross into our country without and contrary to the laws of this great Nation have committed an illegal act. Calling them not illegal doesnt make them not illegal. I really would like to point out that we have a curious way to discuss this as a policy. that is. no one here stands responsible for the decision. You know. the alternatives to incarceration were created by judges. and the judicial system stands in a little different situation than the Members of Congress. When one of these people whos let out under alternatives to incarceration in fact commits another criminal actand believe me. it happensnothing more than just DWI. when you run over a little kidthe judge. who puts him on that particular forum. is held responsible. And he is now going to read his name in the newspaper that he put that person out that should have been in jail. out on an alternative to incarceration. Or if the person commits another criminal act even more severemurder. rape. robberyif it happens when the judge puts him out on alternatives. the judge has to take the heat. But as we have this great policy debate in Congress. no one who is arguing to release all these people on alternatives is taking any heat at all on what the accomplishments in the criminal realm will be of those we release. I approve of alternatives to incarceration. I just told you that 64.000 people alone in the city of Houstons jurisdiction. which is the valley all of the way up to Beaumont. were out on alternatives. But detention beds are also full and overflowing. When I visited the ICE unit there. the red uniforms were the majority. and the red uniforms are criminal aliens. They have committed crimes in this country. And so I think we are being a little bit safe to make these arguments as we stand here in these hallowed Halls. Never is our name going to appear in any newspaper when one of these people commits an act that causes damage to our fellow citizens. And yet we make this argument very passionately. I just want to remind everybody that we are responsible for those criminal aliens that we release. and criminal aliens are right now being released. And. in fact. Ms. Napolitano. after I asked her specifically. Are you releasing anyone from detention. she looked me right in the eye and said. No. And 2 days later. she released 2.300. And of those 2.300. the top two categories were both represented in that releasethe most serious and the secondmost serious categories of crimes we hold people for. So this is a policy. This administration continues to have a policy of not enforcing the law. and. quite frankly. we need this availability of beds so we can enforce the law. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida .
1130052541,I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise to present to the House a bill to fully sustain funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. commonly known as FEMA. Right now. at this very moment. dedicated men and women at FEMA are preparing for the possible landfall of Tropical Storm Karen along our gulf coast. and theyre not being paid. Right now. at this very moment. FEMA has begun to recall furloughed employees in Atlanta. Georgia. and Denton. Texas. as the agency prepares for a potential significant natural disaster. According to the National Weather Service. a hurricane watch is currently in effect from Grand Isle. Louisiana. eastward to Destin. Florida. A tropical storm watch is currently in effect from west of Grand Isle to east of Morgan City. Louisiana. and New Orleans and east of Destin to Indian Pass. Florida. Mr. Speaker. this is a major storm. and we have to take it seriously. So this bill before us provides for continuing appropriations to ensure FEMA can fully render assistance to the impacted States and fully support our citizens and our brave first responders. Mr. Speaker. all of us were aware that the government is shut down despite numerous attempts to move forward. We have repeatedly offered visions of a continuing resolution to sustain this governments operations. but to no avail. Furthermore. we have offered to negotiate. to convene a conference. and to work out the differences in a professional and orderly manner. but such offers have been refused out of hand. So. Mr. Speaker. this bill is yet another offer to the other side of the aisle to at least fund vital components of this government. We have a duty to ensure that our Nation is adequately prepared for disasters and that our States are fully supported when they require Federal assistance. This bill does so without increasing the rate of spending and in a manner entirely consistent with the text of the noncontroversial H.J. Res. In short. this bill before us today is all about getting our priorities right. Its my hope that passage of this bill will not only support our Nations emergency preparedness but also lead to a reopening of the entire Federal Government. In closing. I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to lower their partisan blinders. come to the table. and work out our current impasses so that we can get on with the business of fixing our Nations budgetary mess. Mr. Speaker. with that. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130054815,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise to present the House with a bill that sustains our critical border security and enforcement operations within the Department of Homeland Security. Right now. at this very moment. there are brave men and women patrolling our borders. manning our ports of entry. and conducting border enforcement. drug interdiction and investigative missions. but they are not being paid. Right now. at this very moment. border security and enforcement operations are being conducted but with minimal essential personnel. Right now. at this very moment. the National Targeting Center. at which Customs and Border Protection officers check traveler watch lists and ensure that dangerous criminals and cargo never reach American soil. is operating. but its personnel are not being paid. Right now. at this very moment. the EVerify system is not operating. making it impossible for employers to check the lawful immigration status of potential employees. So this bill before us provides for continuing appropriations to ensure that frontline agents along our borders receive their pay and that certain components of DHS can carry out their border security and enforcement missions at full strength. Let me remind my colleagues that our border is not secure. In fact. our border is constantly under siege from smugglers and traffickers alike. and it is our duty to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to carry out the necessary security. enforcement and interdiction efforts. That is precisely what this bill does. This bill ensures that Border Patrol can fully conduct its operations from San Diego to Brownsville and all along our northern border as well. This bill ensures that ICE can fully conduct its investigations. This bill ensures that the Coast Guard can fully conduct interdiction in both the source and transit zones and off the coasts of California. Texas. Florida. and all maritime approaches to the United States. This bill ensures that our immigration verification and biometric identity systems are up and running. This bill also takes steps to turn on our EVerify system. Mr. Speaker. all of us are aware that the government is shut down despite the numerous attempts to move forward. We have repeatedly offered versions of continuing resolutions to sustain the governments operations. but to no avail. Furthermore. we have offered to negotiate. to convene a conference and work out the differences in a professional and orderly manner. but such offers have been refused out of hand. This bill is yet another offer to the other side of the aisle to at least fund vital components of the government. We have a duty to ensure our borders and coastlines are safe and secure and that our laws are being enforced. This bill does this without increasing the rate of spending and in a manner entirely consistent with the text of the noncontroversial H.J. Res. 59. In short. the bill before us is about getting our priorities right. It is my hope that the passage of this bill will not only support our border security and frontline agencies but will also lead to the reopening of the entire Federal Government. In closing. I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to lower their partisan blinders. to come to the table and work out the current impasse so that we can get on with the business of fixing our Nations budgetary mess. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130062719,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize and congratulate General James D. Thurman on his retirement from the United States Army after 38 years of dedicated. distinguished. and honorable service. He will retire on November 22. 2013. concluding his service over the past 2 years as commander of the U.S. forces in Korea. During both war and peace. General Thurman has served with courage and distinction in the face of tremendous adversity. demonstrating his commitment to America and to our people. During his long and honorable career. General Thurman successfully commanded 10 different units at every echelon of command. including extensive operational combat deployments. Besides his command of the 4th Infantry Division and the Multinational Division in Baghdad. Iraq. he made significant contributions during the initial invasion of Iraq as the chief of operations for the Coalition Forces Land Component Command. Other notable assignments during his tenure include operations in Kosova as the chief of the Plans and Policy Division for Allied Forces Southern Europe and battalion executive officer in the 1st Cavalry Division during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In his final assignment. General Thurman served as the senior U.S. military officer in Korea where he was responsible for 28.500 U.S. forces stationed there. His top command priority was to deter and defend against North Korean provocations and aggression and. should deterrence fail. to be prepared to ""fight tonight"" and win. He ensured the readiness of his multinational. combined and joint forces through a broad range of actions. As a result of changes he directed during the two annual multinational. combined and joint exercises in Korea. forces under his command became the most missionfocused training exercises in U.S.-ROK history. His initial assessment of existing capabilities on the peninsula resulted in the addition of an armed reconnaissance squadron and other changes to better prepare and position U.S. forces to respond. His steady hand and strong relationships with his ROK counterparts. as well as with senior civilian and military leaders in the U.S.. were critical to safely navigating several operational crises. A native of Marietta. Oklahoma. General Thurman graduated from East Central Oklahoma University. where he earned his commission through the Reserve Officers Training Corps. His first assignment was with the 4th Infantry Division. which he later commanded and deployed with to Iraq. Since his first assignment. he and his wife. Delia. known as ""Dee"" Thurman. have moved over 25 times in 38 years. including four tours in Germany. two at the National Training Center. and three in my district at Fort Hood. Texas. During that time. they raised two daughters. and they are now proud grandparents. Retirement is to be celebrated and enjoyed. It is not the end of a career but. rather. the beginning of a new adventure. I commend General Thurman for his selfless service to the Nation and to the United States Army. I wish him and his wife the best in the years ahead. and I welcome them as new constituents to the 31st Congressional District."
1130070661,Chairman ROGERS. thank you for the time and thank you. more importantly. for the leadership that you and Ranking Member LOWEY have shown in completing this process and giving us a fiscal year 2014 appropriation bill. I rise in support of that bill. Madam Speaker. the Homeland Security division of this bill is built on three themes: funding essential security and enforcement. increasing legitimate travel and trade. and demanding fiscal discipline and accountability. The Homeland Security division includes a nearly 10 percent increase to the CBP officer workforce and nearly 5 percent increase to ICEs investigations and funding to support ICEs statutorily mandated 34.000 detention beds. more than 13 percent increase to privatization of airport screening. nearly 14 percent increase to cybersecurity. a total of $404 million for the National Bio and AgroDefense facility in Kansas. and significant increases to the Border Patrol assets. Coast Guard operations and acquisitions. Secret Service operations and investigations. FEMAs first responder grants and bombing prevention efforts. In addition. this bill does more to address the wait times. trade and resource shortfalls at our ports of entry. including a landmark provision for a publicprivate partnership authority and a mandate for CBP to work with industry on performance metrics and improved operational plans at our Nations busiest airports. However. this bill cuts the overall DHS budget by nearly $400 million below the fiscal year 2013 level. and it holds administrative overhead at 2 percent below the current sequestered level. In addition. the Homeland Security division requires 31 departments to provide expenditure plans. terminates ICE public advocacy programs. zeros out three new headquarters offices. and mandates the most comprehensive accounting in DHS history. Madam Speaker. this is a bill that is worthy of support. I rise in support of this great work and thank both the majority and the minority staffs for their work.
1130112993,Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Madam Speaker. it is a proven fact that lawlessness breeds lawlessness. and. sadly. I believe this assertion sums up the issue that is confronting us today. Thanks in large part to the Presidents political decision not to enforce our immigration laws. a chaotic situation has erupted into a national security crisis and a law enforcement nightmare along the border. We all know the facts: An estimated 90.000 unaccompanied alien children will cross into south Texas Rio Grande Valley by the end of this fiscal year. Another 145.000 children are estimated to flood the border in fiscal year 2015. And these staggering figures do not include the tens of thousands of families who will also surge across our border over the same period of time. As a result of this influx. our brave Border Patrol agents. CBP officers. and ICE agents are spending countless hours in caring for children rather than focusing on their primary enforcement missions. This would be tragic if it werent so preventable. Madam Speaker. we do not have an open border policy in this country. and as we tragically learned on 9111. border security and the integrity of our immigration system truly matter to our Nations security and the rule of law. So. today. we offer a strong but initial step to provide both the right tools and the right authorities to address and deter this seemingly unending influx of illegal aliens. Included in this package is $405 million. completely offset by recovered funds. for the Department of Homeland Security. funds that will enable the CBP and ICE to enforce our laws and apprehend. detain. and deport illegal aliens. Perhaps most importantly. this bill fully funds the administrations realization that detention is. in fact. a necessary deterrent to illegal immigration. The President requested funds to fully support the longmandated annual bed capacitya complete reversal from his budget request in which he proposed. instead. to reduce detention beds by nearly 10 percent. The President has also retracted his policy on the detention of families who illegally cross the border. This bill provides funding through the end of the fiscal year to support 34.800 detention beds and an additional 6.320 family detention bedsa total of over 41.100 detention bedsto enable the necessary consequence management for breaking the law. Lastly. this bill includes policy changes to bring reform and parity to the adjudication and reparation of these children and to prevent these children from being placed with criminals. Madam Speaker. we must act and we must act now. Lawlessness has bred lawlessness. and we must act to stop it and to secure our borders. I urge my colleagues to support this strong bill.

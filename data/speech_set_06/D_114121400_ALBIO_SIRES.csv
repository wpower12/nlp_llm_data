1140001902,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak tonight. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my disappointment and deep concerns regarding the administrations plan for loosening the sanctions and initiating diplomatic discussions with the Cuban dictatorship. It is naive and misguided to think that this is going to give us the longdesired political and economic changes that the Cuban people deserve. In fact. just a few days after the announcement. Raul Castro made sure to dispel any misgivings and brazenly declared that the regime would not abandon its communist path. let alone loosen its stranglehold over the people of Cuba. I feel that the administration has abandoned all those Cuban people for all those years who fought for human rights and democracy in Cuba. I feel that those people who are still lingering in the Cuban jails are so disappointed in this administrations efforts. You know. the Alan Gross release should have been something joyous. And we all wanted Alan Gross released because he was incarcerated for no reason other than he was foreign. But to release three Cuban spies or a network of spies that exists in this country currently is just not acceptable. Alan Gross should have been released on his own. He did nothing. He just went to Cuba to establish some sort of communication for this community. The other thing that is troubling me. coming from New Jersey. is the fact that there was no discussion about any extradition of the criminals that are currently in Cuba. There are over 100 criminals in Cuba. including Joanne Chesimard. who killed a State trooper in New Jersey point blank 30 years ago. She escaped to Cuba. She has been enjoying the sun. she has been enjoying the beach. Meanwhile. Trooper Werner Foersters family for over 30 years grew up without a father. And yet we cant seem to get this government to think that it is important that we bring these people to justice. As a matter of fact. the FBI has named Joanne Chesimard as number one in the list of terrorists that they want back. So to me it was very disappointing because the people of New Jersey. after all these years. are still trying to bring this woman to justice. People tell me. well. we negotiate and we trade with Vietnam. we trade with China. We trade with other countries. And I say this: that is not the island that I want in Cuba. We havent helped Vietnams people at all. There is still no freedom. and there are human rights abuses. You look at China. it is the same thing. You look at North Korea. it is the same thing. I dont want that for the island where I was born. And I surely dont want that kind of government 90 miles away from this country. You know. the history of Cuba. all in the past 50 years of this dictatorship. has been one to try to hurt this country as much as it can. and I certainly dont want that 90 miles from this country. The administration with this effort has taken away what we believe was a pressure point on a communist dictatorship 90 miles from this country. It has taken away how we can pressure this island. First of all. Russia cant help them any more. Russia used to help Cuba to the tune of $4 billion a year. Venezuela cant any more. Venezuela is falling apart. There are 30.000 Cubans in Venezuela trying to create the same type of country that we have in Cuba. And at this point. we take away this pressure and basically give millions of dollars to this dictatorship. People may not know it. but any time anybody sends any money to Cuba. the Cuban government keeps 30 percent of it. So if you raised it from $500 to $2.000. you tell me how many millions that is going to be. When you go to all of the beaches and to the restaurants. that is all government owned. In Cuba. if you want to set up a business. you have to negotiate with the government. If I want to set up a business and I need 100 workers. I dont go out and get 100 workers. I go out and speak to the government and the government tells me you have to pay $15 an hour. They in turn give those workers $23 an hour. That is not helping the Cuban people in their economics. That is not helping them move forward. So I think it is really naive to think that these kinds of changes are going to help. You know. I can only think back when I was young. and I came to this country at the age of 11. I remember when they took all of the books out of the school system and started the indoctrination process. I remember the military coming into my house and they took inventory. My mother and father were poor people. but they took inventory of everything that was in the house. And they threatened my parents that if anything was missing at the time we got our visa. it would be revoked. This is not the country that I want for Cuba. I want a country with democracy. I want a country where human rights are observed. And yet. for 50 years this dictatorship has been killing. People talk about Raul Castro as some sort of a changer. People forget that Raul Castro and Che Guevara were the ones who set up the firing squads in Cuba that killed thousands of people. Thousands of people were killed by the firing squads. So I rise today in total disappointment. and I hope that this administration sees that this is not the way forward. that this is a hardened dictatorship. and that the only way we can deal with this dictatorship is through pressure. Through pressure is the only way to deal with these people. especially at this time. There is nobody that is going to come out and bail out Cuba. Just last year. they were funneling arms to North Korea right in our backyard. Is this the kind of government we want 90 miles from our shores? I thank my good friends for having this hour. allowing me to express my sentiments. and I thank all my colleagues who are here speaking with the same approach.
1140069188,Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank Chairman ROYCE. Ranking Member ENGEL. and all the staff for their support in promoting democratic values around the world and in their efforts to bring this resolution to the floor. I also want to thank my good friend ILEANA RosLEHTINEN for serving as the Republican lead on this legislation. I also want to recognize the leadership of my colleague. Chairman JEFF DUNCAN. on this issue. Freedom of expression is the key to a thriving democracy. It is the number one tool to hold people and governments accountable for their actions. In recent years. many organizations dedicated to freedom of speech and advancing civil societies have been trying to bring attention to the deterioration of press freedom in parts of the Western Hemisphere. specifically in Latin America and the Caribbean. Cuba has consistently been characterized as having one of the most repressive media environments in the world. with the Castro brothers controlling all aspects of the print and electronic media. Venezuela and Ecuador have harassed and fined the media. shut down press operations. and even physically attacked journalists who were trying to expose the statesponsored crackdown against peaceful political dissenters. In other countries. such as Mexico and Honduras. an increase in drugrelated violence and worsening security situations have created a culture of impunity. allowing violence against journalists and the press to go unpunished. As a child in Cuba. I witnessed the deterioration of democracy as the Castro regime took over the island and systematically destroyed all aspects of freedom of speech and expression. There is a strong connection between the countrys democratic values and the freedom afforded to their press. Working to preserve freedom of speech and pushing back against those who seek to quiet dissenters should be a top priority when engaging our neighbors in the region. That is why I introduced H. Res. 536. a resolution condemning violations of press freedom. violence against journalists. bloggers. and individuals exercising their right to freedom of speech. This resolution condemns these violations and urges countries in the region to implement the recommendation of member states made by the Organization of American States. Office of Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression. This resolution also urges our administration to assist the media in closed societies to promote a free press. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 536 to help foster better protections for the press around our hemisphere.
1140069549,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this measure. I want to start by thanking Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their work on global health and their efforts to bring this bill to the floor. I would also like to thank the many Members who have cosponsored this bill. especially Congressman MARIO DIAZBALART. who has gracefully acted as the Republican lead. Additionally. I would like to thank the staffers who worked diligently to bring H.R. 2241 to the floor for a vote. Infectious diseases and other health conditions still claim the lives of nearly 9 million people each year. Emerging health threats. such as drug resistance. pose a serious threat to human health across the globe. New vaccines. drugs. tests. and other health tools are desperately needed. Progress cannot be made without a sustained investment in research and development. U.S. investments in global health research are central components of U.S. foreign policy to increase national security. strengthen U.S. relations around the world. and reduce infectious diseases. The U.S. has a legacy of leadership in global health research through agencies like USAID. That is why I was proud to introduce H.R. 2241. the Global Health Innovation Act. This will provide the oversight needed to gain a clearer picture of USAIDs global health research and development. Over the years. research and development projects have greatly expanded at the USAID. searching for advancements toward an HIV- and AIDSfree generation and preventable maternal and childhood deaths. and preventable infectious diseases. This legislation is an effort to keep up with the scope of USAIDs expanded efforts and ensure their research and development activities reflect their goals and priorities. This report asks them to provide clarity on their goals and metrics to better understand their work. H.R. 2241 directs the USAID administrator to report annually to Congress on the development and use of global health innovations in USAID programs. projects. and activities. The report must also include how the Agency measures progress. investments. and developments toward their healthrelated goals. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 2241 to allow Congress to exercise its oversight powers and ensure USAIDs research and development efforts reflect their priorities. Mr. Speaker. I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL once again. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2241. I yield back the balance of my time.

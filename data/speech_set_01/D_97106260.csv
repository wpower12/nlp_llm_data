970007402,Mr. Speaker. I think bf the recommendations made by President Reagan last night. Mr. Speaker. we on the majority side of the aisle should not be obstructionists at this critical time In the history of our Nation. We must be willing to work with Mr. Reagan and the Republicancontrolled Senate to formulate a new economic policy for America that will reduce the oppressive level of inflation and put the American people back to work in productive jobs. Mr. Speaker. I hope you will take the lead in this effort. tue5 LinietianUL IJeUIJW UesOvL Vo VU PRSIEN RAGN H that the Reagan proposals we heard PRESIDE EAN WSHAND last night of both budget cuts and tax PN BEOIS PENISE NDE cuts.

970008458,"Mr. Speaker. February is Black History Month. As we come to the end of It. I would like to point out how inappropriate it Is that the shortest month of the year is the one in which we hionor black Amenlcans and their contributions to our country. The list Is long. the accomplishments many. and far too many of them were made in the face of extreme adversity. Rather than naming names and citing contributions. I want to talk about just one aspect of black achievementand that is black business. There are many triumphs to list here. all the more remarkable In the face of the problems that inexperienced blacks have met trying to borrow money to finance business ventures. It is like the old dilemma of trying to get your first job when everyone you apply to demands experience. In the last decade. though. almost every Federal agency has made available some sort of incentive program to stimulate formation and support of minority businesses. The two major sources of aid to black businesses have been the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency In the Department of Commerce. There is still a long way to go down the road to business equality. ""The Negro Almanac: A Reference Work on the AfroAmerican."" 1976. reports the annual sales of the countrys top black firm. Motown Industries-$46 millionwere no more than those produced by General Motors in onehalf of 1 day. Incidentally. Mr. Speaker. I was proud to observe that the 10th largest blackowned business listed in the almanac got its start in my Fifth Congressional District in Dallasthis despite the fact that. in 1973. only 6 of the 100 largest black businesses were located in the Sbuth. February is far too short to conmemorate black history. We should be aware all year of the contributions black citizens have made to the economic strength of the country. More Important. we must continue to encourage black business skills to come to full flowver. We knowv there is a pressing need for greater economy in Government. Cuts will be made in the Small Business Administration. But we have to be absolutely sure that any cuts are made across the board. and that fledgling black businesses do not bear more than their share of the pain.*"
970092971,"Mr. Chairman. I rise In opposition to the sale of the AWACS package to Saudi Arabia. The decision to provide sofbhisticated weapons to an unstable government In an unstable region is. In my judgment. simply wrong. It Increases the possibility of this secret technology falling into the hands of our enemies In the region. It endangers the security -of Israel. our only stable ally in the Middle East. it will further escalate the arms race In the Persian Gulf. and it will not increase Saudi Arabias security or improve United States credibility as an ally. The sale of sophisticated equipment to a government as unstable as Saudi Arabia will endanger. rather than promote. United States interests In the Middle East. Sadats assassination by religious extremists. the fall of .the Shah of Iran. and the recent Shiite uprisings In Saudi Arabia Itself underscore the Instability in the region and In Saudi Arabia In particular. If Moslem extremists can penetrate the security forces of Egypt. which were regarded as among the best In the Middle East. why should we believe that they will not be able to Infiltrate the AWACS crews and hijack Americas most sophisticated weaponry to Libya? Even our NATO allies. which have a form of the AWACS. use It under U.S. control and supervision. The Jackals that surround Qaddafi must be Indeed howling with glee at the prospect of obtaining some of the most powerful. weapons in the American arsenal. Above all. the threat the package poses to Israel Is real and not. imagined. The AWACS and other equipmentmost notably the 1.177 AIM9L Sidewinder missiles. which were responsible for shooting down the two Libyan Jets over the Mediterraneanare part of a system that forms a formidable offensive unit when Integrated with the P15 aircraft we have already sold them. It can dispatch enhanced F15s at a moments notice and coordinate an attack on all fronts. Should technology on ground stations and communications equipment being sold to the Saudis fall into the hands of the Soviets or Libya. It could be used to create a communications linkup with other Arab nations. all of whom could Join in a concerted attack on Israel. Mr. Chairman. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly called upon other Arab nations to join in -a holy war against Israel. Its contempt for the Camp David peace process Is well known. and It led the Arab boycott of Egypt because of the peace treaty with Israel. It continues to finance the terrorist activities of the PLO against Israel and Jews around the world. It Is therefore impossible to believe. as the administration claims. that further arms sales would cause Saudi Arabia to moderate Its antiIsrael and antiEgypt stance. The 1978 sale. of F15s did not moderate Saudi attitudes toward Israel or the* Camp David accords. Senator RUDY"" BoSCH WITZ Of Minnesota said at a recent Senate meeting on the proposed sale that the difference between the Saudis and the rest of the Arabs was a tenfold Increase In oil prices compared to an elevenfold increase. ""What kind of friends are they?"" he asked. ""If the Saudis are moderates. the rest of the Arabs are real SOBs."" If anything. antiIsra~l attitudes have hardened. In sum. Saudi Arabia has shown no inclination to moderate its antiIsrael attitudes or Its antipeace policies. and Congress should not rubberstamp an arms package with such dangerous Implications.e"
970101143,"Mr. Chairman. I must admit that this Is one of the most significant pieces of banking leg. Islation that is going to come through this House in a long time. I think it is actually rather ridiculous that this matter is going to receive only 1 hours worth of discussion. I think the sum amount of time that is being allotted to the opponents of this bill Is the 3 minutes that I have been granted. so let me say very quickly what I have to say. Our last speaker. the gentleman from Connecticut talked about this bill being a bigger hammer for a bigger Problem. The gentleman is absolutely right. It is a bigger hammer to flatten out the entire financial structure of this country. October 27. 1.981 The proponents of this legislation are making one of the most serious mistakes I think that could ever take place. When this bill comes back from the Senate. you are going to see a. Christmas tree bill like nothing we have ever seen. I have seen It repeatedly in the legislative pattern. We say. ""Well. it was not our intention to change It. but circumstances changed. They changed so drastically that we had to do it. We had to get this bill through to save the mutual savings banks of New York City."" It is with considerable reluctance that I rise to oppose H.R. 4603. the Deposit Insurance Flexibility Act. I am reticent because. as a member of the Banking Committee and an advocate of viable financial Institutions. I am very aware that extraordinary economic conditions require appropriate remedies. This bill does a lot of that. It allows the FDIC. the FSLIC and the NCUA. unprecedented latitude to help troubled financial Institutions. especially savings and loans and mutual savings banks. All this Is desirable and necessary. It allows regulators to step In when an institution is on the verge of failing and taking actions to protect the institution. its depositors. its shareholders. and Government interests. Instead of leaving well enough alone. this bill goes further and becomes fatally flawed: It undermines the very foundation of our basic financial system by specifically authorizing interstate and Interindustry acquisitions. This runs directly counter to primary protection of the financial system afforded by the McFadden Act and the Bank Holding Company Act. These protections are necesary to protect small and medium sized financial institutions of our decentralized system from predatory practices by giant institutions and giant nonbanking corporations. Consistent with the bills Intent as emergency assistance. these exceptions would expire September 30. However. legislation is already being considered by the Senate Banking Committee that would capitalize on this bill and make the exceptions larger and permanent. I would stress that this is not a partisan issue. Within the Banking Committee. these destructive provisions were opposed by many Republicans and Democrats. in fact nearly all subcommittee chairmen argued and voted against them. It is not regional. except that most of the beneficiaries. large financial institutions. are located in a few major cities. The potential victims. Independent institutions. are located throughout the country. Who are the intended beneficiaries? Supposedly. savings and loan institutions. but the U.S. League of Savings and Loans testified against the bill because of these flawed provisions. October 27. 1.981 Col Mutual savings institutions? They also need assistance but oppose this help if It includes interstate and interindustry authorization. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors .appeared against the bill. The National Governlors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures oppose it The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank contends the Fed already has Implied powers to approve InterState acquisitions as does the Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board contend the same foi savings and loans. This bill would legitimize those assumptions. Who does want this bill then? Certainly not the supposed beneficiaries. Certainly not nearly al financial institutions. Certainly not State banking officials. Although well intentioned and with some good provisions. this bill is fatally flawed so long as It authorizes big banks to acquire savings and loans. so long as it allows thrifts to acquire banks. so long as It allows Institutions in one State to take over institutions in other States. all destructive to the very foundations of our banking system. In authorizing such takeovers. this bill does far more harm than good and I urge my colleagues to vote against it."

970127097,"I am talking inthe general context of this administration about. a kind of doubletalk that is taking place here today. That doubletalk deals with full employment. on the one hand and then talks about prosperity. but talks as if those 9 mlllion Americans who are unemployed do not exist. Yet this Is the highest number in the last 22 years. Tell them about this doubletalk program that is bringing us Into real prosperity. I am glad to be able to get to address this group because I am oppose to this resolution. I think It is an absolute mistake. I think it Is an absolute mistake we are engaging in passing this resolution and I would ask my colleagues to vote against it. The GrammLatta program that we passed was full of hal truths. was full. we learn now. of basically dishonest figures. We learn now that it was put together in haste. and now that we knowi that It was a mistake. how can we Justify continuing with it In the future? I do not think that we can. When we look. at exactly what the real figures show. the figures In this resolution are absurd. This resolution says we are going to have a defict of $37.85 billion. The reality that is floating out of the 0MB now is that the real deficit that Mr. Stockman and others have been attempting to hide is somewhere in the neighborhood of $109 billion for this fiscal year. $109 billion with cumulative effect estimated on the low side of $380 billion in the next 3 years. I submit to my colleagues when we look at those figues. if the people who stood before is say we are for a balanced budget. it Is unreal. It is amazing to me that only yesterday the Republcan Party basically was saying deficits do not cause inflation. Now today deficits do not matter. Now if. that is not doubletalk I have never heard of it. and I would say to the gentleman from Ohio. that deficits do cause inflation. and I would say that they are going to casue some problems. they are going to cause more unemployment. and I think In the long run we wouldbe far better off if we defeat this resolution. Mr. Speaker. today we are considerIng the second concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982. What we have before us is a reaffirmation of the Oramm/Latta substitute adopted on May 20. 1981. This substitute projects a deficit of $37.65 billion. It Is being sold on the floor of the House as a ""stopgap measure"" In order to give the President and .the administration sufficient time to place their economic program in tune with reality. I oppose this measure. The Gramm/ Latta -proposal was nonsense in the first place. It was based on unrealistic assumptions. and It was hastily contrived. -Moreover. Its. principal salesman. David. Stockman. did not believe In It. we cannot have an economic recovery program. no. matter what.adminlstration sponsors it. that Is based upon half truths or. in some instances. deliberate falsehoods. We cannot formulate public Policy based upon mere aocomodation to political pressure because we feel the President is popular. We do not have a $37.65 billion. defi. cit. we have a $109 billion deficitand the Republican economic advisers say that high deficits do not matter. I assume that all of my dear colleagues on the other side of the aisle will have to throw away all of their old newsletters wherein they complained about deficit -spending. I suspect they will now be quoting JACxKu M. who said that the Republican Party ""no longer worships at the altar of the balanced budget"" This GrammLatta fiasco. which Is before us. is being considered under a closed rule which I recall the Republicans generally oppose when they have an amendment. The reason we have a closed rule is to prevent anyone from offering an amendment that would reduce the deficit or balance the budget Certainly. we have also precluded any positive action. either on the revenue or spending side. that would address the problem or rising unemployment. We cannot continue to dodge the Issues In this country In order to accommodate an economic recovery program that has not only failed to meet the administrations expectations. but has failed to meet anyones expectations. I do not Intend to participate In this makebelieve game. I urge Members of both parties to face -reality. Let us start designing program that will balance the budget and protect necessary national priorities Therefor. .1 vigorously oppose this resolution. I wish to Insert also for the RECORD my dissenting views: The House Budget Committee has reported out a resolution that incorporates the same figures and is based on the same economic assumptions contained In the OrammLatta First Budget Resolution. Obviously. since none of these figures Is valid. this action Is Intended as a stopgap measure. In order to confrom to the provisions of the Budget and Impoundment Control Act. which requires a spending ceiling and reve.nue floor be In place before adjournment. in essence. action has been defcrred until next year. By then we will have a more realistic assessment of- the policies that have been enacted In terms of their impact on our economy. . Of course. it goes without saying the GrammLatta proposal was nonsense In the first place. It never had any realistic assumptions and was rothing more than a careless. hastily contrived measure. which Its principal salesman. David Stockman. didnt believe In. Nevertheless. this actoni has been necessitated because. of the failure of this Administration to develop and implement a consistent economic plan that conforms toeconomlc realities. We receive proposals In September that are labeledas qbsolutely essential for the success of the economic recovery Program. only to have them- delayed or abandoned a few weeks later. It Is going to be very difficult to knoWL What to believe when this Administration gets Its act to. gether. If It ever does. and presents a budget to us next year. Budget Director Stockmans Private assessments. which have now been madb public. are that Reaganomics wont work. that the tax bill favors the rich at the expense of the poor and middle class. and that the Defense Department has at least $30 billion worth of waste and inefficiencies. Stockmans various comments. as reported In the Atiantic Monthly. reflect his growing disenchantment with the Administrations program: ""None of us really understands whats going on with all these numbers. Youve got so many different budgets out and so many different baselines and such complexity now .. And it didnt quite mesh. Thats what happened. But. you see. for -abouit a month and a half! we got away with that because of the novelty of all these budV et reductions . . . There was Ia certain dimension of our theory that was unrealistic .. The supplysiders have gone too -far. They created this nonpolitical view of the economy. where you are going to have big changes and abrupt turns. and their happy vision of this world Is growth and no inflation with no pain."" Mr. Stockman also acknowledged that ""the defense numbers got out of control . .""lHe said. ""As soon as we get past this first phase. in the process. Im really going to go after the Pentagon. The whole question Is blatant Inefficiency. poor deployment of manpower. contracting Idiocy . . . think theres a kind of swamp of $10 to $20 to $30 billion worth of waste that can be ferreted out If you push hard."" Regarding the tax cut. which Is partial to the rich. Stockman said. ""The hard part of the supplyside tax cut Is dropping the top rate from 70 to 50 percentthe rest of It Is a secondary matter . .. KempRoth was Vlways a Trojan horse to bring down the top rate."" He went on to admit. ""Its kind. of hard to sell trickledown so the supplyside formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really trickle down. Supplyside is trickle down theory."" In any event. the Budget Committee Is willing to take a waltandsee attitude. I do object. however. to the fact that we have not updated the economic assumptions and applied them to this res olution. Let no one be mislead by this Republicansponsored proposal to reaffirm the First Budget.Resolution which states the deficit in 1982 will only be $37 billion or that we will have a balanced budget by 1984. The real deficits are $100 billion in Fiscal Year 1982. $119.0 billion in Fiscal Year 1983. and $132.4 billion in Fiscal Year 1984. This Is a cumulative deficit of $360.4 billion In the next three years. Thus. every figure contained In this report will have to. be changed next year. I can only hope that our delay will not contribute to the current recession. Unfortunately. I believe It will and. therefore. I cannot support this resolution."
970128661,Mr. Speaker. the residents of south Dallas have recenty discovered just how devastating President Reagans budget cuts can be. The community health clinic located in the Martin Luther King Community Center has received a notice from the Department of Health and Human Services. which funds the facility. that it must close Its doors as of December 31. 1981. This section of the city has an infant mortality rate double the national average. the Incidence of tuberculosis Is four times the national average. and the rate of deaths due to heart disease Is 13 percent above the national average . These figures show the great need for health care In this area of Dallas. The health center is the only such facility serving this portion of Dallas. Its patients are primarily lowincome wage earners and senior citizens. It opened on May 27. 1980. and has 7.000 families registered to participate In its health program. In 1 year It had over 16.000 patient visits for medical and dental treatment. Ninetyfive percent of the people It serves have incomes at or below the poverty level. Half of its adult patients are female heads of households. Threequarters of Its adult patients have illnesses which require longterm care. such as hypertension. diabetes. and heart disease. Forty percent of the adult patients are over 50% years of age. At this moment. the health center has 5.000 patients in active care. This means that they must return for followup visits. The Reagan administration has cut $70 million from the community health center program. These cuts have forced the Bureau of Community Health Services to close over 100 community health centers nationwide. The Dallas center Is one of the facilities wvhich Is scheduled for closure. I have met with both regional and national officials of the Bureau to point out the disastrous effect that the closure of the clinic will have on the surrounding community. Although the center has had some management difficulties. It is doing a job of great benefit to the residents of the area. The mayor and the city council of Dallas have gone on record as supportIng the facility and have offered to lend the center any managerial and accounting expertise that they can. The Citizens Council of Dallas has also offered to aid the clinic with Its management difficulties. Despite these offers. the Bureau of Community Health Services Is remainIng firm in its determination that the program cannot be saved. I disagree with this position. The center has only been in operation for 18 months. and I believe that its problems can be resolved. I do not feel that the people who use Its services should be deprived of medical care because of management problems at the facility. I have requested that the Bureau grant the clinic a 6month probationary period In Which to correct the difficulties. I will be discussing this option further with the Bureau and am working hard on saving the center for Dallas residents. While I agree with the need for Federal budgetary constraint. I do not believe that budget saving should be made at the expense of the health of Dallas residents. Our most Important resource in this time of economic trouble Is our citizenry. and the health of our citizens Is an important factor in our ability to work and be productive members of our society.* E 5801 E 5802
970134906,Mr. Speaker. this month we mark the 100th anniversary of one of our greatest PresidentsFranklin Delano Roosevelt. This man who overcame the crippling effects of polio went on to lead our Nation through its gravest domestic crisis and most severe international challenge in this century. In each case. he weathered the test. In meeting these challenges. he left as his legacy programs that define our presentday social and economic system and a style of leadership that is the test against which we measure the performance of our Presidents today. As we face a time of economic trial today. it is helpful to look back to see how F. D. R. met the grave economic challenge of his time and to see what lessons we can draw for ourselves today. The programs enacted during the Roosevelt administration are now so much a part of the fabric of our society that we tend to take the benefits of these programs for granted. We assume they have always been there. One way to appreciate the Roosevelt legacy is to remember what it was like before F. D. R.s New Deal. Before F. D. R.. no Federal program provided the elderly with any degree of security in their retirement years. After F. D. R.. there was social security. Before F. D. R.. no ones savings deposits were secure. After F. D. R.. the Federal Government Insured savings accounts. Before F. D. R.. adequate regulation of the securities market did not exist. After F. D. R.. the stock market was regulated to protect investors and the larger economy. Before F. D. R.. workers could be fired for union activity. After F. D. R.. the workers right to organize into free trade unions was secured. As Joe Alsop reminds us in his recent book on F. D. R.. the Roosevelt legacy may be summed up by saying he included the excluded. Until Roosevelt. many of the economic and political benefits of this land were denied to those who were not rich. not white. and not of an AngloSaxon Protestant background. F. D. R. began the process. still incomplete. of including the previously excluded groups of Americans into our society. economy. and politics. Roosevelts greatness lies not only in the programs he left us. but also in the way he exercised leadership. For many of us today. the way that F. D. R. exercised leadership still provides the model against which we evaluate contemporary Presidents. What were some of the keys to F. D. R.s effective leadership? One key to his leadership was that he was a master communicator. F. D. R. was effective in all settingslarge audiences as well as small groups. He was particularly effective in the use of radio. which was the most important means of communication in his time. F. D. R. also had a gift of explaining some very complex ideas and proposals in a way that was understandable to everyone. Another important element in his leadership was his emphasis on experimentation. F. D. R. was not a prisoner of any ideology. He wanted results. In order to achieve results. he was open to ideas from just about any source. If something did not work. he would reject it and try something else. F. D. R. was also very effective in conveying a sense of optimism about the future. But it is not enough Just to convey optimism. Such optimism has to be credible. I I Many Presidents who try to convey optimism are unconvincing. Roosevelts optimism. however. was believable. People believed that things would actually get better. They felt this way because they saw he actually had a program that was workable and was fair to everyone. Wlat useful lessons for today can we draw from the Roosevelt years? First. we must not stray from the inclusionary principle laid down by F. D. R. It is the right path. It is the fairest. It has brought unequaled benefits to the people of our Nation. But in following the path of F. D. R.. we must also remember his emphasis on experimentation and results. We should continue his work but do it as he would have done itwith an openndss to new ideas and an emphasis on what works. Just like Roosevelt. we should not be blindly attached to policies of the past that have become outmoded. Our test should be what works. Conditions change. Problems are solved. We should be willing to reassess policies in the light of changing conditions. And if we decide that a policy is no longer appropriate. it is not an admission that the policy was always wrong. It is only an admission that it is not appropriate or useful under todays conditions. To continue the work begun by F. D. R. of including the previously excluded and to do so in the manner of F. D. R.-with an openness to new ideas and a willingness to discard policies that dont workthis is how we can best honor the memory of F. D. R.e
970176978,"Mr. Chairman. in April 1981. when the Budget Committee was considering the fiscal 1982 budget. I proposed an amendment that would have balanced the budget in 1982. My amendment accepted most of the administrations budget cuts but it omitted the enormous tax cut that the administration advocated and that has contributed to the deficit that we face today. My amendment failed. In fact. I got only four votes. Later the House adopted the administrations budgetthe GrammLatta substitute. The administrations budget was based on the radical ""supplyside"" theory that you do not have to balance the budget. It was based on the theory that an enormous gap between what you spend and what you take in in revenue will somehow send a positive signal to Wall Street. During the Budget Committeep markup last year. my good friend. the gentleman from New York who is the architect of the administrations tax cut. made a statement that I found shocking and almost incredible at the time. However. events have proved the accuracy of Mr. KEMPs remarks. On April 7. 1981. the gentleman from New York. Representative KEMP. the coauthor of the Presidents tax program. had this to say about the philosophy underlying the administrations program: Balanced budget. I used to think that * * I do admit to that. Whats radical about Reagans economics. and Stockinans economics. and Republican economics today i we dont any longer worship at the shrine of the balanced budget Well. Mr. KEMP may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget. Mr. Stockman may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget. Mr. Reagan may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget. and Republicans in general may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget. but millions of Americans do. Millions of Americansincluding a good number of folks in the the financial marketscontinue to believe that the Federal Government should balance its own accounts so that it spends no more than it takes in. I find myself now in a very difficult situation. It is hard to know what is the fiscally sound course to take. I voted to report the Budget Committees recommendation. because I believed we needed a vehicle to bring this debate to the floor and that was the fairest and soundest proposal I had seen until that point. But we are now in the middle of a debate in which achieving a deficit of $110 billion is considered a great victory for fiscal responsibility. Last Friday. the Republican Senate passed a budget with a deficit of $116 billion. The Republican alternative that we have before us has a deficit of $110 billion. according to the most recent CBO analysis. This is the budgdt that President Reagan endorses. I never thought I would have lived to see the headline: ""Republican President endorses $110 billion deficiti"" How things have changed How did we get to this point where a $110 billion deficit is hailed as a great victory? We all know the answer to this question. The answerin one wordis ""Reaganomics."" Reaganomics has produced a 1983 projected deficit of $182 billion. Compared to a Reaganomics deficit of $182 billion. $116 billion looks good. But only In comparison to the outrageous result imposed upon us by Reaganomics. Last year the administration told us we needed a massive military buildup. They said we needed to spend $1.5 trillion on the military over 5 years. Along with this massive increase in military spending. they said we needed an enormous tax cut. To be more specific. they said that the wealthy and big corporations needed a big tax cut. The message was: The Ntion needs this big military buildup. but we do not have to pay for it. In fact. we need to make major cuts in our revenues. This illogical combination of spending increases and tax cuts was somehow supposed to instill confidence in the financial markets. This has not happened. What has happened was what was predictable all along. The financial markets saw that Reaganomics produces increasing deficits and so they kept interest rates high and stifled recovery. In addition to a $182 billion deficit. Reaganomics has also given us the Worst recession since World War II. Last month. unemployment reached 9.4 percent. 10.3 million Americans are out of work. Industries like liousing and autos are in a neardepression state. I only wish that this administration would give a greater sign that it is finally realizing what its policies have produced. Reaganomics has given a tax reduction all right. jobless people do not pay taxes. This is now day 490 of the Reagan administration. Fourhundred and ninety days ago a President was inaugurated who the American people believed would balance the budget. In day 490 of the Reagan administration. we are further away from a balanced budget than we have ever been in the history of our Nation. I am running for attorneygeneral of Texas. I will not be around to remind the administration of its promise to balance the budget. I hope that you who remain will do this for me. The time has come to reject this folly called ""Reaganomics."" The time has come to reject the foolish and dangerous idea that we can have a massive increase in military spending without paying for it. If we truly need it. we shoidd be willing to pay for it. The time has come for our Republican colleagues to join with us Democrats to restore a sound fiscal policy to this Nation. We need to work together to fashion a budget that is fair to all Americans and that is based on accepted standards of fiscal responsibility. The Latta budget is untair and irresponsible. It hurts the elderly. it denies educational opportunity to mil. lions of Americnns. and It is a ""back door attempt"" to cut social security benefits. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of a year ago. Defeat the Latta budget."
970197473,"Madam SpeakerWe hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights ... Those words to not apply only to men. they must apply to all. It is evident in our society that they do not. we. therefore. are reintroducing today the equal rights amendment (ERA). The ERA. which was first introduced in 1923. failed to become part of the U.S. Constitution before the original deadline for ratification ran out and has failed to attain enough States for ratification before the extension limit ended on June 30. The States that did not ratify the ERA should hang their heads in shame because they are collaborating in the continuation of discrimination. We. the supporters of equality. pledge not to give up this mighty struggle until not only the ERA. but also equality for all citizens is reached in this great country of ours. We feel certain that the States which have stood firm through this first endeavor will act immediately upon passage of this legislation to again ratify the ERA. All rightthinking Americans should accept this new amendment as their rallying cry for equality. It is encouraging that so many Members of this Congrt - are strongly in favor of this legislation. The wording of the ERA is simple. ""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" We have considered changing this simple language to try to refine it and to satisfy some of its critics. but we have decided that there is no real reason for that action. What needs to be said is said in a clear. straightforward manner. Equality of rights is the cornerstone on which our representative democracy is built. I am. and will continue to be. a strong adherent to the cause for equal rights. not only for women. but for all citizens of this Nation. In 1971. when the Texas State Legislature ratified the original equal rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I strongly supported its action. At that same time. the legislature placed on the ballot an amendment which would include equal rights language in our State constitution. I was running for the State legislature in 1972 and had the privilege of campaigning actively or that State equal rights amendment. Passage of the amendment was an important part of my platform. I was elected. and the amendment passed overwhelmingly. In 1975. I served as a member of the committee of the Texas House of Representatives which had jurisdiction over constitutional matters. The committee reviewed the claims of opponents of equal rights. The committee was presented with statements of the appalling effects equal rights laws would have on our State. We found then. and I am happy to report now. 10 years later. that none of the evils forecast by ERAs detractors have come to pass in Texas. ERA has served as a positive force in our State. Many laws have been changed to erase the inequality women have faced in the areas of credit and property rights. In 1978. as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. I again had the privilege of showing my support for equality for all citizens by voting for extension of the ratification deadline for the ERA. Along with other supporters. I participated in marches and counseled legislators in other States in order to encourage the ratification of the amendment. As an individual who had been a long time supporter of equality. I wanted others to know that political success is in no way thwarted by backing the equal rights amendment. In good conscience we cannot say that women deserve fewer rights than men. Women are the backbone of our families and our Nation. They are taxpaying citizens. Those who oppose the ERA forget the contributions that women have made. They overlook the fact that women carry many of the burdens and only reap part of the benefits. It took more than 140 years for women to obtain the right to vote. Until 10 years ago. they did not have an equal opportunity for education or a right to equal pay. We are slowly moving to rectify the imbalance. The ERA is one of the ways in which we can do this. Along with ERA advocates. I felt the bitter disappointment of not gaining enough States for ratification. Nevertheless. I have learned from our history that if we do not give up in our struggle for right. success will come. Thr e is old saying: ""When the going getz tough. the tough get going."" In the face of adversity. we need.to get going. We need to stand up for what is right. We Americans pride ourselves on our freedom and it is right that we should. We are the greatest free nation in the world. We are a beacon of liberty. People the world over look to this Nation as as example of a free society. We of all people should not forget that freedom is more than a word. it is a right. We need to realize that in restricting the rights of others. our own are restricted. Abraham Lincoln pointed out that ""in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free."" America should stand as an example for other countries in the area of human rights and we should use our influence to advance the cause of womens equality internationally. We already use our Nations influence abroad to fight racial discrimination. We should also use our influence to fight discrimination against women. Before we can do this. we must be certain that our own house is in order. We must wipe out any vestiges of discrimination against women in the laws of this Nation. I believe that women. indeed all Americans. are entitled to equal access and equal treatment under the law. If we err in our judgment as to the rights of individual citizens. we should err in the direction of liberty and not in the direction of restriction. I agree with Woodrow Wilson when he said that: ""Liberty does not consist in mere declarations of the rightpof man. It consists in the translation of those declarations Into definite actions."" My colleagues I will be leaving the Congress this year. but I will continue to support the cause of equal rights for all citizens. I intend to push for ratification of the ERA and defend the rights of all our Nations citizens in whatever position. or capacity. I may hold in the future.e"

980015715,Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from New York. A review of Soviet abrogation and manipulation of treaties and their own laws indicates a complete disregard for the spirit and intent of many international agreements as well as the Soviet Constitution itself. I am not at all confident that a freeze or reduction agreed upon by our Nation and the Soviets. without the benefit of onsite inspection. will guarantee the protection of the American people and our allies from the threat of Soviet nuclear blackmail. On numerous occasions before this body I have cited flagrant examples of the disdain of the Moscow government for the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. better known as the Helsinki Final Act. The House Foreign Affairs Committee repeatedly reports resolutions practically begging the Soviets to comply with the terms of that agreement. which pledges respect for human rights. and fundamental freedoms. Including freedom of thought. conscience. religion. or belief. Ask Lithuanian Catholic or Russian Jewish schoolchildren how their government respects the terms of the Helsinki accords as they are ridiculed in school for attending worship services. Ask those who monitor compliance with the Final Act if they are permitted to pursue violations by the Soviet Government. You are certain to find them in prisons throughout the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe in nations such as Romania. Ukraine. and the Baltic States. In addition to the Helsinki accords. the Soviets have violated the terms of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. the U.N. Declaration of Decolonization. chemical and biological warfare agreements and a very disturbing list exists. containing many more blatant examples of the Soviets disregard for agreements they have signed. Even the agreements supposedly forged between the Soviet Government and its people in the Soviet Constitution are overlooked with Impugnity. Article 50 of the Soviet Constitution guarantees freedom of speech. print. assembly. and street demonstrations. Ask thousands of prisoners of conscience how their government protected those freedoms. Article 72 of the constitution states that each Soviet Republic has the right of free secession from the U.S.S.R. Ask Latvians. Estonians. and citizens of more than a dozen other Soviet Republics if they feel free to declare their independence tomorrow. Better yet. ask the same question of nations supposedly outside the Soviet Union. such as Poland. Hungary. and Afghanistan. I am not willing to rely on the demonstrated trustworthiness of the Soviet Government to maintain an international balance of power under the terms of an arms freeze or other agreement unless we have the opportunity to actually conduct physical inspections of Soviet facilities. My case for onsite inspection rests on hundreds of thousands of individual instances of the refusal to comply with international agreements by the Soviets. I do not want to stand on this floor at a future date and beg the Soviet leadership to abide by an agreement affecting our national security. Like it or not. our freedoms over the past two decades have been based on a defense system heavily dependent on our nuclear arsenals for their deterrent effect. I am convinced by past and present Soviet conduct that we cannot insure our security without the ability to fully inspect each location where Soviet nuclear weapons are deployed.
980021251,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to House Concurrent Resolution 91. I regret that this year we have been presented with a budget. essentially drafted by the Democratic caucus. on a ""take it or leave it"" basis. If you were to ask me whether I thought the budget presented by the administration contained unnecessary restraints on domestic spending. I would answer ""yes."" If you were to ask me if I thought the Presidents budget contained too much money for defense. I would also answer ""yes."" But we are presented today with a budget which fails to strike a realistic balance between the ligitimate needs of our national defense and domestic social programs. What we have is a budget which is reminiscent of the 1970s. in which we spend enough money to keep everyone happy and finance that soending through higher taxes. The Budget Committee resolution calls for a cumulative. 5year tax increase of $265 billion. excluding the $50 billion in additional taxes which will result from the Social Security Act amendments. On whose shoulders will this tax increase fall? Not the welltodo. who our Democratic colleagues felt benefited too much from the 25 percent tax rate reduction enacted in 1981. Rather. it will fall on the Low- and middleincome individuals who stand to gain the most from the next Installment of the tax cut and the future indexing of tax rates. If the third year of the tax rate cut were repealed. those making less than $10.000 a year would experience a tax increase of almost 14 percent. while those earning more than $200.000 would have their taxes increased less than 3 percent. Further. almost 78 percent of the benefits of indexing will fall to those with incomes of less than $50.000. One could almost gather from the revenue provisions of the Budget Committee resolution that the majority hopes a recovery will not occur. We are clearly at the beginning of an economic recovery. and most economists would agree that consumer spending is a key to the early stages of a recovery. If the committee believes that one can encourage increased consumer spending by taxing a higher percentage of individual income. it is living in a dream world. Two years ago. we embarked on a program to reduce the rate of growth of domestic spending programs from the 13.8 percent annual rate which existed through the 1970s. I think nearly everyone will agree that in times of recession. spending for social programs must necessarily increase. But I question seriously whether a 5year. 44percent increase in nonsocial security entitlement programs is fiscally responsible. Add to this a ""nonfreeze"" in discretionary programs and the institution of a plethora of new spending initiatives. and you wind up with a domestic spending increase of $181 billion over the next 5 years above the Presidents request. How is this increase to be financed? Through higher taxes. of course. It is interesting to note that the $30 billion increase in domestic spending proposed by the committee is roughly equivalent to the revenue increases it has recommended. Finally. I want to note the failure of the committee to adequately come to grips with the credit budget. which is largely offbudget. but nonetheless has a profound impact on productivity. interest rates and economic growth. The need to finance high budget deficits and Federal credit activities and at the same time the private sector needs credit to fuel economic recovery has created competition for scarce resources. To think that we can continue to add literally hundreds of billions of dollars each year to Federal debt financing obligations and still insure that adequate financing capital can be obtained by the private sector is senseless. Mr. Chairman. I agree with some of what I see in the committees budget. It has taken a reasonably sensible approach to higher education assistance. mass transit. and assistance to older Americans. Unfortunately. the majority on the Budget Committee has apparently not learned anything from the crisis which befell the social security system. namely that virtually uncontrolled spending ultimately causes more problems than it solves. In exchange for some short term political capital. the Democratic majority is asking Americans to pay and pay and pay some more."
980089516,"Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I wish to echo the sentiments expressed by the distinguished chairwoman of the Government Activities and Transportation Subcommittee. The efforts of the gentleman from New Jersey. to Improve public health and safety. through this legislation are commendable. I fully realize the difficulties in seeking the broad consensus necessary for approval of this legislation. Chairman FLORio. and my colleague from New York. have persisted in this difficult task. to produce this important bill. I would like to briefly comment. on the findings of our Government Operations Subcommittee. as they relate to the issue before us today. In a hearing held July 18. in New York. on hazardous materials transportation. which includes hazardous wastes. the fire marshall of Nassau County. made a comment I found most troubling. He stated that his office had been contacted on several occasions. to assist in handling spills. or other emergencies involving hazardous wastes. When asked to recommend a qualified firm to remove the material. he was at a loss to name one. and he replied. ""There are people in New Jersey who take care of those problems."" In testimony provided by the National Tank Truck Carriers. for our Washington hearing on hazardous materials transportation. the Department of Transportation. is criticized for failing to enforce authority. over intrastate carriers of hazardous materials. particularly hazardous wastes. which are often handled by small firms. with lax safety compliance. and sometimes total disregard. for Federal transportation and environmental laws and regulations. Closer investigationwould probably showthat these fJrms do cross State lines. Congress has given the Department of Transportation. authority to regulate these intrastate carriers. in the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. however. it is not exercised. By designating the Department of Transportation as the enforcement arm for certain sections of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. the Environmental Protection Agency at least recognizes that a potential for serious environmental consequences exists if hazardous wastes are improperly handled. or Illegally disposed. during transportation. . A sound knowledge of the transportation industry. and familiarity with shipping documents. are needed to track the movement of hazardous wastes. Our staff investigators. have seen firsthand. the manner in which unscrupulous firms take wastes from a generator acting in good faith. illegally dump them. and substitute similar materials. which are disposed under the original generators manifest. This type of abuse must be halted. and a coordinated effort by DOT and the EPA. must be undertaken to address the situation. Until our investigation was initiated. EI.A had not even provided its list of waste carriers to DOT. even though the latter agency was supposed to play a major role in enforcement effort. This failure to provide the most basic inforcement tool. a list of regulated firms. was inexcusible. Our amendment is aimed at establishing a higher standard in the waste disposal industry to protect the public. The language before us. is not strong as I would have liked. but it is an attempt to get the EPA and DOT to realized and address their responsibilities to protect the public. while hazardous wastes are transported. While both agencies will say that the States have enforcement capabilities. and regulations. to bolster Federal efforts. a look at the industry. and compliance with State laws. indicates a strong Federal presence is necessary. if we are serious about solving the problems caused by illegal transporters. Again. referring to our subcommittee hearing. the chairman of the New York State Senate Select Committee on Crime. brought out a typical example of the interstate nature of hazardous waste transportation. A load of a chemical known as MEK or methyl ethyl keytone began a trip from New Jersey. to a West Virginia disposal site. according to the shipping manifest. required under Federal and State law. That truck mysteriously wound up in a Long Island parking lot. where it overturned with the hatch covers opened. in the middle of the night. The chemical polluted Long Islands aquifer. the sole source of drinking water for nearly 3 million people. For those of you unfamiliar with the geography of the Northeast it was necessary to go approximately 50 miles east from New Jersey. crossing three bridges to reach Long Island. and that same trip would have to be repeated. to get back on the road to West Virginia. This is only one example. of incidents uncovered during our investigations. which covered Baltimore. Chicago. and the New York metropolitan area. and it underscores the need for continued Federal involvement. No enforcement mechanism is perfect. however. the EPA and DOT have a lot of work to do. to improve the current situation. I hope our amendment will emphasizewhat I see as a need for greater supervision over transporters of hazardous wastes."
980139751,"Mr. Speaker. today we are again reminded of Soviet oppression. As we observe the 65th annit versary of Latvian Independence Day. we are acutely aware that Latvians are1 not permitted to celebrate this historics day. In 1944 the Baltic nation of Latvia was incorporated into the Soviet Union. The history of the Latvian nation Is one of a land divided amongst aggressors and repressors. Latvia has been under the control of Germany. Sweden. and now of course is under Russian rule for the the second tim6. When the Soviets reconquered the land during World War II. it deported thousands of Latvians to Siberia. In their place loyal Russian colonists were sent to settle. A systematic russification of the people. culture. and land was set in motion. Native Latvians were relegated to the status of second class citizens within their own nation. By 1970 the percentage of Latvians had decreased to 57 percent of all residents. Yet despite the tragic past. and continued efforts to erase all traces of Latvian heritage. the Latvian people have never abandoned thikeir hope for the return of an independent Latvian nation. The commemoration of national holidays such as November 18. the day of national Independence. and participation in ceremonies to honor national heroes. are actions which underscore the commitment to the preservation of a strong and independent identity. Although the Soviet Union discourages exhbitions of nationalistic exCpression. artists. writers. and compos. -ers have joined in demonstrations to protest Soviet domination. President Reagan has stated that. y""As a nation. we remain dedicated to the furtherance and preservation of the fundamental human rights and s freedoms of all people"". Clearly this y reflects the strength of American solii- darity with the continuing struggle for il Latvian independence. At this time I d urge my colleagues to support efforts n to reestablish the independent Latvian t- nation which was absorbed by Coiny munist forces nearly 40 years agos0 1- * Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker. this week marks the 65th anniversary of Latvian idepcndence Day. it is Indeed unformate that the people of Latvia. annot join us in celebrating this day. ut as we all know. the Soviets moved ito the Baltic country In 1940 and ave done everything possible since hen to eradicate all signs of Latvian idependence. All of the fundamental reedoms enjoyed by the independent atvia have been eliminated by the oviet Government. Among other Inustices. the Latvians are not permited to practice their religion or to peak freely in public. Those of us aised in the United States find it hard o fully comprehend the severity of uch restrictions placed on the daytoLay lives of ordinary citizens. In the belief that Latvia will once Lgain be free. those persons of Latvian ieritage In the United States and elsevhere throughout the world continue *he struggle which will enable Latvia .o one day break away from the J.S.S.R. The hope of freedom Is a ~trong Incentive. Mr. Speaker. and it has kept these brave people working constantly over the years toward that goal of renewed Latvian Independence. In addition. the thought of freedom keeps the hopes of those persons still in Latvia alive. and helps in part to ease the terrible burdens of living under the harsh rule of the Soviet Government. Today we are saluting those brave people. and at the same time. we are here to reinforce a position taken by the U.S. Government which is vital if Latvia Is to regain its independence. That position is th2 nonrecognition by the United States of the Latvian Incorporation into the U.S.S.R. The United States continues to recognize the legitimate independence of Latvia. and still refuses to accept the Soviet control of the Baltic nation. Congress Is supporting today our Governments policy in this regard. and will continue to do so until Latvia is once again free. Knowing the strong spirit of the Latvian people. I do not hesitate to inform the Soviet Union at this time that Latvia will indeed be free once again*"
980156262,"Mr. Speaker. during the past few weeks. Members of Congress have spoken of the struggles of the people throughout Eastern Europe who have lost their homelands and freedom to foreign domination. Today I rise In commemoration of the people of Estonia who have shared in the tragedy of their Baltic neighbors. Estonia. along with Lat via and Lithuania. shared a brief but shining time of Independence and free government.. Since World War II. when much of Eastern Europe was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. Estonians under Communist control have yearned for the return of selfdeteriminat ion and freedom In their own land. Estonia. which was victimized by the brutal Nazi war machine. has more recnt ly suffered at the hands of the Russians. The Soviets desire to obliterate all traces of the Estonian nation -its history. culture. traditions. and religion. ""Russification"" mtIhods have included intimidation. arrest. and deportat ion. Still. the spirit of Ite Estonians thrives. their hope has not been diminished. On this. the celebration of Estonian independence. the American people salute their courage. and support [heir ongoing struggle.* a Mr. EDGAR. Mr. Speaker. tonorrow is the 66th anniversary of Estonian Independence Day. During the two decades during which the Estonian people enjoyed their indtpendence. they dermonstrat.ed what a small nation can achieve while enjoying a democratic way of life. In 1940. Stalin illegally absorbed Estonia and the other Baltic States into the Soviet Union. the United States still does not recognize this occupation. Now. for over 40 years. the people of Estonia have fought to retain their identity in the face of ceaseless oppression by the Soviet regime. Those of ts who live in freedon have an obligation to renetrber the valiant efforts of Estonians and to work for foll implementation of the Helsinki accords. which prot ct human rights in countries like Estonia. Therefore. I hope thtct city colleagues will join me in cosponsoring House Concurrent Resolution 192. which calls on our representatives to the United Nations to raise the questton of the occupation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union. Likewise. we should all continue to work to establish basic human rights and freedom for the Estonian people. Let us join with Estonians here and in their homeland in looking toward a day when Estonians can again live freely and enjoy the full richness of their cult ure.0"
980170301,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 5154. This bill includes the initial funding for a U.S. space station program as requested by President Reagan. as well as funding for a number of other important programs. The space station will foster innovative technology in two ways. First. it will require the use of new technology for the station itself. Second. the station will be a research facility for developing additional technologies such as spacebased manufacturing processes for commercial applications on Earth. The idea of a functional workshop in space carries with it a number of new scientific applications never previously attempted. These include a highly automated design. space maintenance and repair provisions. the smooth incorporation of new developments within the stations design. and a usercommunity design approach. Therefore. I wholeheartedly endorse NASAs endeavor to invest in new technology. The regenerable life support system is a striking example. Without it. a station crew of eight would require an annual supply of 44.000 pounds of water. 10.000 pouncs of oxygen. and 14.000 pounds of lithium hydroxide (to absorb carbon dioxide). Space shuttle transport costs alone for this material would cost in excess of $70 million per year. If the technology were available for the regenerable life support system. the $100 million estimated development costs would be amortised in less than 2 years of operation. NASAs new technology approach would serve to invigorate American industry by first. distributing over t5 percent of the space stations systems investment to industry. and second. creating an environment of industry competition for space station design and development contracts. This will help to maintain this countrys position at the cutting edge of new and innovative technology. One other important initiative contained in H.R. 5154 Is the advanced communications technology satellite (ACTS). The ACTS program Is uniquely well designed to serve both sparsely and densely populated regions. In addition to serving remote areas of the United States. a large potential market exists in developing countries. Therefore. development of the ACTS system may have a very positive effect on our balance of trade. I am pleased to see that mention is made in the report of the need for a fifth orbiter. The bill provides funding for spare parts but does not fund the fifth orbiter. I firmly believe that a fifth orbiter will be necessary in the late 1980s and early 1990sespecially if we are serious about building a space station. A fifth orbiter would provide the means to build the station as well as support the expected commercial demand for shuttle launch services. H.R. 5154 is a well balanced and responsible piece of legislation. Funding is provided for major new initiatives as well as for basic research in space sciences and for planetary exploration. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5154.e
980196749,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of II.R. 4145. the State of Justice Institute Act. This legislation represents the most valuable effort made by this body to aid State and local governments In strengthening and improving their judicial systems. The responsibility of protecting the rights of all citizens under the Constitution is shared by State and Federal courts. Creation of the State Justice Institute will assist State courts in meeting their increasing obligations under both State and Federal law by providing funds necessary for technical assistance. education research and training. This will encourage the modernization of State court systems with respect to efficient management of caseloads. budgeting. and development of reliable statistical data. Establishment of State Justice Institute will place responsibility for improvement of State court systems directly on the judicial officials charged with this responsibility under their own constitutions and laws. thus respecting the principles of separation of powers and federalism. I would like to point out that the measure before us today not only provides funds for valuable education and training. it also prohibits any duplication of existing programs or activities. As we strive to more closely monitor the spending of Federal tax dollars. thus provision is an assurance that funds we allocate today will only be used for much needed court improvement programs. . It is important for us to remove the competition between State judiciaries and State executive agencies for Federal assistance. A national program of assistance specifically for the improvement of State courts will create a beneficial environment for the admintstration of State court systems. In addition. the State Justice Institute will fill a current void by representing State courts in future national policy decisions that will affect the Nations total justice system. I urge my colleagues to join me in improving the State court systems by supporting H.R. 4145.e
980236367,"Mr. Chairman. I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 4784. the Trade Remedies Reform Act which this Chamber is about to consider. Without a doubt. critical reforms are necessary in order to combat the unfair and detrimental trade practices of foreign governments which are partly responsible for our increasing trade deficit. However. H.R. 4784 as reported from the Committee on Ways and Means. is clearly not the vehicle for this task. I believe the legislation possesses a series of pitfalls which will expose U.S. exporters to unnecessary impairment. Such damage is likely to reverberate throughout the U.S. economy. Members. no doubt. have been informed of exporters fears of retaliatory or ""mirror"" legislation if H.R. 4784 is enacted. This apprehension is wellfounded. At a time when the Congress should be taking action to encourage our trade partners to pursue more open and accessible markets. we are considering legislation which will cause protectionist responses. This is hardly a responsible method of streamlining and clarifying current trade policies. Numerous questions have been raised as to the spirit and legality of the legislation with regard to its targeting. natural resources. and downstream dumping provisions. The legislation represents a significant departure from longstanding U.S. and international trade policy. Rather than providing additional protection for U.S. export concerns. the Trade Remedies and Reform Act of 1984 will subject such industries to more closed doors. and more closed markets. Several firms. including a major national corporation in the district I represent. have complained that regulations of the Commerce Department and the slowness of that agency. have hindered their ability to compete internationally. I believe we should look at the hurdles we already have in the Federal Government before we institute sweeping changes of questionable utility. In confronting this serious issue the committee has brought the subject of U.S. trade policy to the forefront of legislative of debate. nevertheless the bill it sends to this body must be defeated for the ultimate benefit of U.S. exports. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4784.0"
980252626,Mr. Speaker. a recent news item reported the naming of a replacement for James Prior. Margaret Thatchers minister for Northern Ireland. I would hope Douglas Hurd. Mrs. Thatchers new representative is more flexible and openminded. For if Mr. Hurd exhibits the same sort of judgment displayed by Mr. Prior. I fear we will witness the continuation of Northern Irelands divided and bloody legacy. On August 12. at a Belfast rally organized by the Catholic minority we again saw how the military power of a supposedly democratic government was directed at a relatively small group of unarmed civilians. In our Nation we have seen much larger demonstrations on political and social issues with no military presence at all. In opposition to the longstanding tradition of free speech in England and the United States. the British again attempted to silence discussion of the issues. They refused to allow Martin Galvin. an American visitor and human rights activist to enter Northern Ireland. When Galvin suddenly appeared on a platform at the rally. British soldiers began firing plastic bullets into a crowd of some 3.000 while bowling over others with vehicles and clubs. the life of one young man was snuffed out as a result of this violence. Scores of others required hospitalization. The brutal and irrational actions of the British security forces demonstrated anew the deep rooted hatred that exists between the Catholic minority and the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland For the sake of all the innocent lives which have been lost and the futures of all those on both sides of this emotionally charged issue. I wish Mr. Hurd sincere good luck in working toward a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Irelands six northern counties. I hope he will learn from the unfortunate errors of his predecessor. and take immediate action to prevent confrontations between unarmed civilians and the British military. The best solution would be an end to the brutal military rule that has been imposed by the British.e
980260085,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank my colleagues from New York for reserving this time. As the plight of Soviet Jewry becomes more desperate with each passing day. forums such as todays special order are essential. We must continue to focus attentgen on this ongoing deprivation and violation of human rights. Throughout history the Jewish people have been subjected to persecution. Of late. the Soviet Union has expanded its harassing role to include governmentsponsored . antiSemitism and antiZionism. In the past 18 months official Moscow channels have been hard at work promoting and sanctioning vicious racial attacks. A recent Soviet publication entitled the ""Poison of Zionism."" makes sweeping inaccurate assertions. The Jews of the world are blamed for the deterioration in EastWest relations. They are also held responsible for the control and direction of the Western media and military industrial complex. These farfetched statements are compounded by completely ridiculous contentions which characterize the Mafia as under Jewish control. and state that Jewish millionaires aggregate capital ""exceeds the U.S. gross national product."" This publication even goes so far as to blame Jews for the Prague spring of The Government continues to refuse the free flow of emigration. If this years pattern continues. we will see fewer than 1.000 individuals leave the Soviet Union. This is a drastic decrease when compared to the 50.000 who were granted permission to emigrate in 1979. It is additional proof that the Soviets are in clear violation of the numerous human rights treaties which they have signed. People around the world will be watching closely when Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko visits Washington to meet with President Reagan. I trust longstanding U.S. policy of addressing the issue of Soviet Jewry. will be adhered to during the leaders conversations. The lives of thousands depend upon our vigilence. I urge my colleagues to continue to press this issue so that it will not be ignored.e"

980054019,Mr. President. fn an era of skyrocketing educational costs for families throughout our country. it is with great pride and personal pleasure that I salute the activities of a family from Malverne. Long Island. whom I have known for many years as friends and neighbors. Robert J. Malito and his family have established the very first scholarship fund at the new CUNY Law School at Queens College in memory of his late brother. Tony. This scholarship. the Anthony E. Malito. Jr.. scholarship fund. will distribute $1.000 each year to a needy and deserving student who has shown both academic excellence. noteworthy citizenship. and a special aptitude and interest in public service law. The new CUNY Law School. dedicated as it is to public service and public interest law. provides a specialized curriculum designed to encourage young men and women to take their law backgrounds into government and to seek career rewards in government and public service. This scholarship aids those who may not be financially capable of assuming the enormous burden of the costs of higher education and encourages a continued interest in government service by young people attending this law school. I am personally pleased to report the establishment of this scholarship fund because Bob Malito. his wife. Margaret. and his mom and dad. Phyllis and Anthony Malito. have been personal friends of mine for many years. Bob serves as a pro bono special adviser and counsel to me and has offered invaluable assistance and advice during my years of government service. This scholarship fund was established in memory of his late brother. Tony. a professional engineer by training and vocation. Just prior to his death in 1966. he served with distinction as a community liaison in Queens County to our colleague. the late Senator Kenneth B. Keating of New York. Tony Malito had a deep and abiding interest in government and public service and is justly and warmly remembered for the establishment of this scholarship fund.e recent years. and today hundreds of courageous individuals are incarcerated in 12 of these hospitals throughout the Soviet Union. In addition. other political or religious activists are confined in hundreds of ordinary psychiatric hospitals located in every Soviet urban center. Recently. Amnesty International reported that at least 300 prisoners of conscience are known to have been incarcerated in Soviet psychiatric hospitals since 1969. Soviet authorities have also imprisoned members of the Working Commission To Investigate the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes.

980071473,"Mr. President. I am happy to join today as a cosponsor of S. 1324. the Intelligence Information Act of 1983. This important legislation amends tile National Security Act of 1947 to regulate the public disclosure of information held by the Central Intelligence Agency. As the author of the Intelligence Information Protection Act. introduced in the 97th Congress. I am acutely aware of the need for S. 1324 to become law during this Congress. S. 1324 adds a new title VII to the National Security Act. This title exempts the operational files located in the Directorate of Operations. Directorate for Science and Technology. and Office of Security of the Central Intelligence Agency from the provislons of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requiring publication. disclosure. search. or review. To be exempt. such files would have to be specifically designated by the Director of Central Intelligence to be concerned with: First. The means by which foreign intelligence. counterintelligence. or counterterrorism information is collected through scientific and technical systems. Second. Foreign intelligence. counterintelligence. or counterterrorism operations. Third. Investigation conducted to determine the suitability of potential foreign intelligence. counterintelligence. or counterterrorism sources. and Fourth. Intelligence or security liaison arrangements or information exchanges with foreign governments or their intelligence or security services. Under current law. the CIA must spend hundreds of thousands of personhours reviewing its highly sensitive operational files. In the vast majority of cases. the contents of these files are found to be exempt from FOIA disclosure rules for national security reasons. What little information is released is redacted and fragmented and thus of little use to anyone. The essence of S. 1324. therefore. is that it will permit the Central Intelligence Agency to concentrate its efforts solely on releasable documents. The price to the public of so many futile searches is that FOIA requests pending with the CIA are now backlogged for more than 2 years. Hundreds of requests deserving of immediate attention do not. therefore. receive it. The cost to the CIA is that it must divert highly trained intelligence officers from their primary duties and assign them to the processing of FOIA requests. There is another serious problem I became aware of while working on my own bill during the 97th Congress. Despite the screening procedures employed by the CIA. sensitive intelligence information has been released in the handling of FOIA requests. This has hampered the development of good relations with foreign intelligence services and has led individual sources either to refuse to cooperate with. or to terminate their relationships with. the CIA. Recent news reports indicate that S. 1324 is a compromise measurb acceptable to both the CIA and the American Civil Liberties Union. Although operational files would be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Linclassified political. economic. and scientific information obtained through CIA operations would still be available to the public. Indeed. this latter category of information would become available more quickly once the CIA is freed from the excessively timeconsuming review of Its operational files. It is also important to note that individual U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens will continue to have access to any files the CIA maintains on them. Mr. President. the Freedom of Information Act was first passed in 1966. President Johnson described it as stemming from the principle that ""a democracy works best when the people have all the information that the security of the Nation permits."" It is because I believe that the Intelligence Information Act is true to that principle that I add my name as a cosponsor today and urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this important reform. Finally. I wish to thank my distinguished colleague from the State of Arizona. Mr. GOLDWATER. for proposing this excellent piece of legislation.e ."
980148343,"Mr. President. I rise this afternoon to join as a cosponsor of 8. 2031. legislation which would require the U.S. Embassy and the residence of the American Ambassador to Israel to be located in the city of Jerusalem. the true capital of Israel. Historically. Jerusalem has alwaysbeen the capital of the Jewish people and the focal point of Judaism. Since 1000 B.C.. when it was the capital of the Kingdom of David. until the present. no other nation has laid claim to Jerusalem as being its capital. The Jewish people pray three times a day to Jerusalem and believe strongly in Psalm 137: ""If I ever forget you. Jerusalem. may my right hand lose its strength."" However.. when Israel proclaimed its independence following the termination of the Palestinian mandate by the British In 1948. five Arab nations Joined in a war against Israel with the primary intent of abolishing the Jewish State. They did not succeed. although Jordan did succeed in seizing the eastern part of Jerusalem. On April 5. 1949. Israel and Jordan signed an armistice calling for a ceasefire. This agreement also partitioned the city. giving neither country control of the city until further negotiations could settle the dispute peacefully. On December 13. 1949.Prime Minister Ben Gurion. in making the proposal that all Israeli Government Ministries move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. stated: Ever since the establishment of the Provisional Government. our principal care has been the security and economic consolidation of Jerusalem. In the stress of war. when Jerusalem was under seige. we were compelled to establish the seat of Government ia HaHirya. Tel Aviv. For the State of Israel. however. there has always been and will always be. the Eternal Jerusalem. Thus it was 3000 years ago and thus It will be. we believe. till the end of time. From that point on. Jerusalem has officially been the capital of Israel. 2 weeks later. Israels democratically elected parliament. the Knesset. con* vened there for the first time. Subsequently. all Government ministries have been located there. In April of 1950. however. Jordan annexed the eastern part of Jerusalem -and. although Pakistan was the only nation to recognize this annexation. controversy began over who was really in control of Jerusalem. Under Jordanian rule. the city was markedly divided with barbed wire fences and concrete walls. The Jordanian Government denied Jews access to the holy places. 58 synagogues were either destroyed or severely damaged. In addition. legislation was passed which restricted ownership or possession of land by Christians within the walled city. In 1967. Israel was again faced with hostilities with Egypt and Syria which were intent on abolishing the State of Israel. Israel requested that Jordan remain neutral. promising in return that Israel would not take action against them. One day later. however. Jordan attacked the western part of Jerusalem. This corflict. known as ""the Six Day War."" ended with Israel gaining control of the whole of Jerusalem. With the unification of Jerusalem. Israeli rule was extended to the eastern part of the city. This unification put an end to the repressive religious practices of the Jordanian Government. The ""Protection of Holy Places Law"" was immediately passed by the Knesset. This law guarantees the protection of the holy places of all religions and the freedom of access to them by all. As an article in the London Daily Telegraph on June 25. 1967. stated: There is no essential incompatibility betweeen these different needs. Jewish political possession of Jerusalem and absolute freedom to It by Moslems and Christiansthese have been declared principals of the State of Israel. Today. 34 years after Jerusalem was officially proclaimed the captial of Israel and 16 years after it was united. the United States. by retaining its diplomatic headquarters in Tel Aviv. still refuses to treat it as the capital of Israel. To this day. American officials are denied certain diplomatic activities solely due to the fact that they take place in the eastern part of the city. which the United States refuses to acknowledge as part of Israel. This is no way to maintain relations with a friend and ally. The exchange of diplomatic envoys Is the primary method of acknowledging one anothers existence and of conducting political and commercial negotiations. What can be said of the quality of diplomatic relations with a country whose capital does not exist in our eyes? It has always been the right of a country to choose the city in which all diplomatic missions are located. When January ft 1984 Brazil moved its capital to Brazilia. the diplomatic corps of all countries followed. And when the Dutch Government requested that The Hague be the diplomatic capital. rather than Amsterdam. Hollands official capital. nations agreed to situate their embastles there. Although the United States (ioes not recognize East Germanys claim to Berlin as its capital. the U.S. Embassy is nevertheless located in East Berlin. So why does the United States not have its Embassy in Jerusalem. that countrys capital. as is the wish of the Isareli Government. when. we so strongly support their democratic way of life? Why do we bow to the wishes of all other countries in the placement of diplomatic envoys. yet refuse to grant Israel this freedom of choice? I believe that the United States should allow Israel this fundamental right of choosing its own capital and adhere to that right by relocating the U.S. Embassy there. In doing this. the United States will demonstrate its commitment to Israel. a free and independent nation. The present location of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv serves only to reject Israels legitimate claim to sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem. Mr. President. the time has come for the United States to show its full support for the State of Israel by locating our Embassy in Jerusalem. the Israeli capital.*"
980171322,"Mr. President. I rise today to honor a man who has been an integral figure in the spiritual and civic character of Syracuse. N.Y.. for almost five decades. Rabbi Irwin I. Hysman of the Temple Adath Yeshurun is living testimony to the fact that great men speak softly. but quietly lead through compassion. quest for knowledge. and a desire to serve their fellow man. Our world has undergone many dramatic changes since that day in 1935 when a Rabbi Hyman. all of 2 weeks out of the Jewish Theological Seminary. first arrived to assume the pulpit in Syracuse. Through the upheavals of war and the triumph of human spirit. Rabbi Hyman has done far more than exhort his Temple members to noble action. Instead. he has given of himself to provide inspiration to all members of his community. and to demonstrate the simple beauty of a mans commitment to the high ideal of service to mankind. Rabbi Hymans deep love of country was gallantly displayed during World War II. Enlisting as a lieutenant in the Armys chaplain service. Rabbi Hyman distinguished himself through selfsacrificing dedication to the spiritual needs of our forces serving on the European continent. His service was rewarded with promotions to the rank of major and presentation of the Bronze Star for outstanding religious contributions to military and civilian personnel which aided the morale of all in7olved. It was during this same period of time that Rabbi Hyman was called on to face one of the greatest challenges of his career of spiritual service. Working closely with our Armed Forces as town after town in Europe was liberat. ed. Rabbi Hyman confronted the full brutality of the Holocaust. that had murdered millions of his spiritual bretheren. Facing the ultimate degradation of the human spirit as mannfactured by Nazi totalitarianism. the rabbi fully committed himself to rendering comfort and aid to the survivors of the death camps. He became energetically active in addressing the needs of the millions of displaced persons who were left without hope or basic needs in the wake of the war. In all of his actions to render assistance. the rabbi never asked about sectarian denomination. Instead. he sought only to alleviate suffering and to provide sustenance to those in need. The postWorld War II years have shown a remarkable diversification of Rabbi Hymans interests and service. Educator. musician. public servant. researcher. linguist. and religious leaderall of these titles have rested comfortably on this tireless champion of the common man. And always at the heart of his efforts is his warm. enduring relationship with the people of Temple Adath Yeshurun. No contract exists between the temple and Rabbi Hyman. Only the type of bond that cannot be captured on paper continues to join this special man and his congregation year after year. Now. as he approaches 50 years of service to the community of Syracuse. Rabbi Hyman Is delighting in participating in the religious growth of the greatgrandchildren of congregants who he originally married. He has watched his efforts bear rich fruit throughout the great State of New York. the Nation. and abroad. He will be honored repeatedly by his community as he nears his silver anniversary of service. But. perhaps the finest comment that can be said about this rare and talented man is based upon his own comments made 25 years ago as he discussed his love of mankind. Everyone has status and a feeling of importance. some in larger and more eminent areas. others in their limited family circles. In a very deep sense. therefore. I have a sense of reverence for a human being as a human being. Mr. President. it is with great pride that I pay tribute to a fellow New Yorker who has served so nobly In the name of decency and spirituality. I am greatly honored to have been selected along with Rabbi Irwin I. Hyman as ""Man of the Year"" by Temple Adath Yeshurun of Syracuse. N.Y.*"
980185346,Mr. President. I rise today in support of the amendment offered by myself and my distinguished colleague. the senior Senator from my State. This amendment is identical to legislation we offered last week. It would transfer jurisdiction over an old Air Force base at Montauk on Long Island. N.Y.. from the General Servicea Administration to New York State for use as a park and simultaneously. it would transfer a park at Fire Island currently administered by the State. to the Department of the Interior. This is a fair and even swap of State land for Federal land. I believe that Senator MOYNIHAN and I have fashioned a very reasonable compromise in this matter. The General Services Administration had opposed our earlier efforts in this area which would have transferred the Federal land to New York State without any compensation to the Federal Government except. of course. for the knowledge that the land was being put to its optimal use. Our current proposal. however. will transfer to the Federal Government land that. by all accounts. is worth more than the land for which it is being exchanged. In fact. the Department of the Interior is eager to acquire the Fire Island parcel and has gone on record in support of that acquisition. . The parcel of land at the abandonded Air Force base has been the subject of lengthy negotiations between the local government and various local citizens groups and the GSA. These negotiations have bogged down. however. because the town government did not believe that any portion of the parcel should be used for private development. The town and State subsequently initiated a lawsuit to prevent the sale of the land. That suit is currently being held In abeyance while the GSA prepares an environmental impact assessment. As these negotiations have progressed. however. the Department of the Interior also has become Interested in the land: The State of New York had filed a request with them to have the land considered as a suitable site for a park. Mr. President. I think it is especially worth noting that the Interior Department issued a press release last Thursday stating that the GSA ought to accede to the request of State and local officials and make the area a park. I believe that this history clearly demonstrates that. but for a few bureaucrats. everyone involved with this problem believes that the area Is most suitable for park usage. It Is for that reason that Senator MOYNIHAN and I are urging that this amendment be accepted. I urge my colleagues to support us in this endeavor. Mr. President. I am delighted to have had the opportunity to work with my distinguished colleague. the senior Senator from New York. in bringing about this magnificent result. I commend the senior Senator for his perspicacity and for his interest in preserving the delicate balance of fragile lands on Long Island. And also to make available and keep open to future generations this magnificent park and recreational area. Indeed. this is a reasonable compromise which will add to the parklands of both New York State and the Federal Government. These precious resources on Montauk Point can never be replaced.
980192039,Mr. President. I rise today in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the College of Human Services. The College of Human Services offers higher educational programs linked to career opportunities and advancement. In fact. the college is considered a model performancebased institution of higher education. The College of Human Services is an originator of paraprofessional programs in law. education. and health care. This pioneering effort led to the paraprofessional movement that has now spread throughout the country. Innovative efforts of the college continue to this day. Graduates of the College of Human Services pursue careers in a wide variety of fields within the human services. nonprofit. and business sectors of the economy. The students of the College of Human Services are an integral part of a bold and challenging venture. Classroom theory is combined with concrete applications in major service sector corporations. Students are uniquely involved in higher education programs designed specifically to educate students for the increasingly serviceoriented economy. Dedicated students from New York and other parts of the country are represented at the College of Human Services. Campuses are located in New York. Florida. and California for students interested in beginning challenging careers or advancing in their present vocations. The College of Human Services has experienced substantial growth and expansion. This fact has been recognized in numerous national publications. The college has also received a variety of awards. including an award from the Academy for Educational Development. The College of Human Services merits the highest praise for outstanding contributions to education in the community. in New York State. and throughout the Nation. The college has exhibited an outstanding commitment to the advancement of higher education. The College of Human Services has gained national recognition in innovative education for the past two decades. Therefore. it is appropriate. Mr. President. that we recognize the College of Human Services on its 20th anniversary.e
980196544,Mr. President. I rise in support of S. 2522. Many in this Chamber are aware that this year is the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Federal Credit Union Act. As we mark a half century of existence for Federal credit unions. it is significant that we are called upon today to consider legislation which will authorize a plan to increase the equity of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The Federal Credit Union Act made the nationalization of credit unions a reality. Instead of being restrained in their service by State charter. the act gave credit unions the authority to follow the common bond of their membership across State lines. With this freedom. Federal credit unions have been able to provide services to their members throughout the world. Today. 50 years after the enactment of that landmark legislation. we are being called upon to approve another credit union bill. Although S. 2522 does not possess the profound characteristics of the National Credit Union Act. it does contain several provisions of significance to Federal credit unions and their members. It is likely that this legislation will substantially effect the operations of credit unions during the next 50 years. Clearly. the most significant aspect of S. 2522 is the positive impact it will have on the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The Fund. which is managed by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). is unique from other federally administered deposit insurance funds such as those of the FDIC or the FSLIC in that it received no initial capitalization from the Federal Government. Revenue for the Fund is currently obtained from the contributions of participating credit unions. Yet. similar to the deposit insurance provided at other financial institutions. the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund guarantees the accounts of credit union members up to $100.000. S. 2522 contains provisons which will strengthen the fund. Instead of relying upon periodic premium payments as a source of capitalization. this bill requires all insured credit unions to maintain a 1.0percent deposit in the share insurance fund. This plan will raise the equity level to 1.3 percent. a level comparable to that of the other federally administered deposit insurance funds. Mr. President. I feel a point here deserves emphasis. The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund was started by credit unions to insure the accounts of their members. Although it is administered by the National Credit Union Administration. no Federal funding has been involved. The plan embodied in S. 2522 came to the Banking Committee as a proposal from credit unions themselves. motivated by an interest to raise the equity level of the fund. Like many financial institutions. credit unions have recently been through a difficult period. Perhaps the proposal to strengthen their insurance fund is reflective of that experience. It was certainly something the Banking Committee recalled as it considered this legislation. In 8. 2522. regarding the capitaliza. tion of the insurance fund. there is a provision authorizing the NCUA Board to extend the initial time period in which credit unions would have to place 1.0 percent of their deposits in reserves. It is the clear intent of this *rovision that the 1.0 percent deposit be phasedin where necessary. any other arrangement might result in hardship for the affected credit unions. I would commend NCUA to take note of this provision and anticipate to use its authority freely. Just as we must remain responsive to the needs of credit union members by legislating a plan which will bring stability to their insurance fund. we should also direct the Agency administering this fund that no precipitous steps should be taken to achieve the 1.3 percent equity level if an alternative plan is available which wit. alleviate any difficulty for the credit unions themselves. Mr. President. as a member of the Banking Committee. I commend Senators GARx and PROXMIRE for their diligent work on this bill. It is responsive to the needs of both credit unions and their members. This bill was unanimously approved by the Banking Committee. and I hope the full Senate will take similar action.
980208836,"Mr. President. it is vith great pride that I rise today in recognition of the bicentennial of the Bank of Now York. an institution with a central role in the history. not only of New York. but also of this country. The bank opened its doors for business otn June 9. 1784. This past Saturday. June 9. 1984. marked its 200th birthday. Barely 3 months after the British evacuated New York City at the end of the Revolutionary War. a group of industrious merchants and shippers met with our Nations first Secretary of the Treasury. Alexander Hamilton. with the intent of organizing the Bank of New York. Their objective was to reestablish and finance our trade relationship with Europe. which had been seriously disrupted during the war. The new bank quickly achieved this goal and also made possible this countrys first trade with thc OrIent. Additionally. the Bank ws.s utilized by Alexander Hamilton as a major financial resource for the Federal Government and. indeed. was the first bank to lend money to the Government shortly after the adoption of the Constitution. As the nation grew. the Bank of New York helped finance Its development. It helped finance the building of the Erie Canal. railroads. the dredging of harbors. the building of factories. and the first New York City subway. It assisted the Nation in the War of 1812 by supplying its capital needs. It sup)orted the countrys first. Industrial development organization. the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufacturers. at the falls of the Passaic River in Paterson. N.J. During the years of the Greot Depression. the Bank of New York was the lender of the last resort that kept many other financial Institutions above water financially. It had the foresight to finance the development of television and was one of the forerunners in utilizing the technology of computers to better serve its customers. The bank also was a pioneer in the area of drivein banking. The Bank of New York has planned an array of functions to mark its bicentennial. It has drawn from its rich archives to produce a. beautifully illustrated history of the bank. documenting its important role in the Nations economic development.. The exhibit. ""Early New York City Banking."" will be shown at various locations across New York State this year. Most items. including Warrant No. 1. the document Alexander Hamilton used to draw against a $200.000 loan he had secured for the Federal Government. thus creating our national debt. will be viewed by the public for the first time. The management and employees of the Bank of New York. both past and present. are to be congratulated on this historic milestone in their history and in the history of banking in this country. As its bicentennial year theme. the bank has chosen the slogan. ""200 Years of Looking Ahead."" My State of New York and the country as a whole have benefited greatly by the foresight of institutions such as the Bank of New York. We can. and should. now look forward to another 200 years of business at the Bank of New York.e"
980239546,"Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation that would finance sorely needed prison. Jail. and detention center rehabilitation and construction through sale/ leaseback transactions between State and local governments and the private sector. My proposal would help alleviate the overcrowding of prisons by providing privatesector incentives to finance the construction or rehabilitation of correctional facilities. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO1 estimates the cost of my bill to be only $16 million in 1985 and $65.5 million on average per year through 1989. CBO also estimates that my bill would result in $1.5 billion of new prison construction annually. This proposal would sunset in 1989. Several pieces of legislation have been proposed in the 98th Congress to relieve the overcrowding of our Nations prisons. Most of these bills entail direct Federal appropriations to States for prison construction. To date. these efforts have failed because of Federal budgetary constraints. despite the fact that the Attorney Generals task force on violent crime has recommended a 4year. $2 billion Federal assistance program to finance the construction of State prisons. My bill. however. would open up a new avenue of funding for correctional facilities by providing Federal tax incentives to private firms. Not only is the sale/leaseback approach less costly than direct Federal appropriations. but it also adds private cost controls to prison and jail rehabilitation and construction. Today. prison overcrowding is one of the most serious problems America faces. The situation has reached epidemic proportions. Presently. 30 States have their entire prison systems or individual jails within their systems under court order to alleviate overcrowding. Judges have ruled that conditions in these jails and prisons represent cruel and unusual punishment and. thus. violate the inmates constitutional rights. The following States are under court order to relieve prison overcrowding: Alabama. Arizona. California. Colorado. Connecticut. Delaware. Florida. Georgia. Illinois. Iowa. Indiana. Kansas. Kentucky. Louisiana. Maryland. Michigan. Mississippi. Missouri. New Hampshire. New Mexico. Nevada. Ohio. Oklahoma. Rhode Island. Tennessee. Texas. Utah. Virginia. Washington. and West Virginia. Additional States. while not yet under court order. have dangerously high populations. Occupancy in our Nations prisons is not expected to decline in coming years. Rather. expected increases will make todays problem look small by comparison. According to a study by the General Accounting Office [GAO]. prison population will increase from 391.597 in 1983 to 528.193 by 1990. Available prison space. however. will only increase from 332.444 In 1983 to 419.869 in 1990. This will result in a 25.8 percent or 108.324 shortfall. The crisis is upon us. Judges in many jurisidictions have already begun ordering prisoners released because of overcrowding. The New York City detention center at Rikers Island was ordered to release 613 of its inmates in November 1983 because of overcrowding. In June 1983. New Orleans was forced to erect outdoor tents to house prisoners. In 1983 alone. 21.420 inmates were released prematurely nationwide due to overcrowding. The problem has grown worse in 1984. And worse yet. even after such releases take place. no new criminal can be sentenced without releasing still another prisoner. According to ""The Privatization of Corrections."" a draft report prepared by Abt Associates for the National Institute of Justice. as of March 1. 1984. 105.684 new prison beds are planned or proposed for construction over the next 10 years by States to deal with overcrowding. State corrections departments estimate that total costs for these desperately needed prison spaces will top $5 billion in government outlays through 1994. Prison construction is not the only enormous expense facing State and local governments. Out Nations infrastructure is rapidly declining and is badly in need of repair and replacement. In New York State alone. the Joint Economic Committee of Congress estimates that $108.8 billion may be needed by the year 2000 to repair and restore decaying infrastructure. This figure includes funding for mass transit. wastewater. bridges. highways. rail. and airports. Where is the money going to come from? With our Federal biydget deficit of such concern. new spending programs must be limited. Will taxpayers agree to foot the bill? Today. State and local prisons and jails are often financed through general obligation bonds. Voter approval must be obtained before the bonds can be issued. Prison construction bond issues are not popular among voters and often are rejected in favor of financing more visible projects. With the problem so enormous and financing so hard to confle by. we must find new. imaginative ways to build or rehabilitate prisons. jails. and detention centers. The private sector can offer assistance and expertise in correctional services in several ways. Many private firms have recently become involved in the financing. construction. and management of prisons. as well as participating in workrelease programs and prison industries. Several successful detention centers built by private firms for use by local government are presently in operation. Lease financing of detention facilities has occurred in several parts of the country as a result of the shortage of traditional financing alternatives. E.F. Hutton has arranged a $30.2 million issue for a jail and sheriffs facility in Jefferson County. CO. as well as a $50 million jail project for Philadelphia. In addition. the Corrections Corp. of America. the National Corrections Corp.. and Behavioral Systems Southwest have financed jails and illegalalien detention centers in Houston. Pasadena. and San Diego. Experience has shown that private firms can construct facilities cheaper that a government entity. Sale/leasebacks by a government entity will further encourage this privatization process. Under these agreements. a private firm agrees to own. finance. and construct a prison or jail. The facility is then leased to a government entity for a specific number of years. At the end of the lease period. the government entity has an option to buy the facility. During the ownership period. the private firm or group of Investors receive tax benefits such as investment tax credits. rehabilitation tax credits. and accelerated depreciation. Sale/leasebacks by government entities. however. were severely curtailed in the recently enacted Deficit Reduction Acd. of 1984 . This bill denies the rehabilitation tax credit and repeals the accelerated cost recovery system EACRSI for sale/leaseback transactions by government entities. These new restrictions were enacted because Congress felt. rightly. that certain entities have used sale/leasebacks for no economically useful purpose. but merely were raiding the Federal Treasury as a substitute for raising their own local taxes. Prior to passage of H.R. 4170. a government entity would sell and lease back an existing structure to a group of investors. The investors would obtain generous tax A ugus t 2. 1984 benefits and the government entity would make lease payments. However. no new project was undertaken and no economically useful activity was furthered. H.R. 4170 has eliminated this abuse. My bill will allow sale/leaseback transactions between government entities and private investors to resume solely for the purpose of State and local prison. jail. and detention center rehabilitation and construction. However. my bill contains safeguards to avoid past abuses associated with sale/ leasebacks. while still encouraging the privatization of correctional facilities. The legislation generally exempts new State and local prison and jail rehabilitation and construction from the sale/leaseback provisions of H.R 4170. However. to receive the rehabilitation tax credit and accelerated depreciation. the structure must be placed in original service no later than 90 days after the signing of a binding contract for use of the structure as a prison facility. In addition. the facility must be used 100 percent for housing prisoners and necessary related facilities. This will effectively avoid the most common abuses associated with sale/ leasebacks. It is important to stress that our prison problem is immediate. The use of sale/leasebacks will allow government entities to quickly finance prison construction through the private sector. Through Federal tax incentives. the private sector can become involved in this pressing public problem. State and local government do not have the necessary funds to build new prisons or jails on their own. Private firms. however. have the resources available. The private sector is the means to finance and construct these badly needed facilities. My bill will unleash $1.5 billion of these funds for badly needed prisons without forcing local governments to go to the polls. CBO estimates that my bill will only cost $16 million in 1985 and an average of $65.5 million per year through 1989. [ feel that this is a small price to pay considering the magnitude of the problem. It is an even smaller price to pay when compared to the threat of releasing ever increasing numbers of criminals into our midst. not because they have served their time. not because they have been rehabilitated. but merely because of overcrowding. Sale/leasebacks for prison construction need to be exempted from the restrictions imposed by H.R. 4170. With prisons and jails increasingly being forced to release violent criminals due to overcrowding. time is running out. Sale/leasebacks by government entities offer an inexpensive solution to this problem. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks."
980271719,Mr. President. I rise today to cosponsor and to lend my firm support to S. 1921. legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague from Georgia. to provide a Presidential line item veto. As the President pointed out in the State of the Union Address. America is healthy and well on the road to prosperity. However. continued economic progress is threatened by overly large Federal budget deficits. The President stated. quite correctly. that how deficits are reduced is as important as the actual reduction. There is little difference between financing increased Government spending through the issuance of new debt or by the imposition of higher taxes. Both methods are equally damaging to the continued vibrance of the economy. Deficit financing and increased taxes both redirect private funds to the Federal Government. The result of either action is that the pool of investment capital is depleted and Industrial expansion is stifled. The root cause of mammoth Federal budget deficits is runaway Government spending. Since fiscal year 1965. Federal spending has increased at an annual average rate of 11.2 pecent. Since that time. the deficit has grown from $1.2 billion to $194.5 billion. Continued efforts to reduce the deficit through higher taxes have failed. The Federal budget is a disaster in need of drastic action. Giving the President line item veto authority would be an important first step toward getting control of Government spending. This would allow the President to reject specific appropriations without vetoing an entire piece of legislation as we must now do. Under S. 1921. however. Congress would still have the power to overrule any veto by twothirds vote. Currently. Congress adds pork barrel programs to important legislation with virtually impunity. The President often hesitates to veto an entire bill which includes wasteful programs for fear of destroying the vital underlying legislation. The line item veto. therefore. would allow the Chief Executive to eliminate waste without destroying critical policy Initiatives. At this time. 43 Governors have line item veto authority over State budgets. Many of these States are required by statute to annually balance their books. I can think of no greater tool we can give the President to control wasteful Government spending than the line item veto. It has proven effective at the State and local level and now should be implemented by the Federal Government. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to lend their support to S. 1921. Thank you. Mr. President.

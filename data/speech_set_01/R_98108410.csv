980002822,and DENNIS EcKART. This serves to underscore the board. bipartisan support that exists for the small business pollution control fi. nancing program. In fact. in three separate hearings in 198182. we were unable to find anyone who agreed February . 1983 with the administrations decision to kill this program. The SBAs program. which consists solely of authority to issue offbudget loan guarantees. was created by Congress in 1976. Its purpose is to help small businesses meet the costs of compliance with environmental protection laws. Such a program was required in order to overcome the unique problems small businesses face in financing pollution control equipment. Both government and private witnesses say there is no adequate substitute for the SBA program as it was established by Congress. Mr. Speaker. according to every witness we heard. and by any measure one can apply. the small business pollution control loan guarantee program has been a great success. It met its objective of helping small business finance the cost of complying with environmental protection laws and it actually earns the Government a net profit because of interest earned on escrow funds. The SBAs pollution control loan guarantee program probably was among the bestrun. most costeffective programs in the Federal Government. The problem is that the program was effectively shut down on January 1. 1982. Acting on orders from the Office of Management and Budget. the SBA changed the regulations governing the pollution control loan guarantee program so that it is no longer of any use to the people it is supposed to help. What they did was to bar the use of the SBA loan guarantee in conjunction with taxexempt financing. even though that linkage is specifically authorized by the 1976 statute and even though that linkage has been integral to the program since its inception. Mr. Speaker. in the first quarter of fiscal year 1982. the SBA completed 18 deals. providing loan guarantees totaling $39.6 million under this program. All involved taxexempt financing. Then. on January 1. 1982. they changed the rules. In the last three quarters of fiscal year 1982. the SBA was able to conclude only one deal. involving the guarantee of $500.000 in taxable financing. Beyond that. they could not find anyone who wanted to participate in the revised program. This does not mean. however. that there are no small businesses who need help in financing Governmentrequired pollution control equipment. Our subcommittee has been besieged by these people. and by numerous State agencies who also argue on their behalf. It is simply that the new rules have rendered a helpful program unusable. Indeed. at the time of the rules change. the agency had about 100 applications pending. totaling $180.9 million in guarantees sought. None of those projects have gone forward and the program contained almost $210 million in unobligated authority at the close of the year. We can only lament the delays in new construction and the resulting Inability of these firms to upgrade their level of environmental compliance There have been bipartisan protests from both sides of Capitol Hill. asking that the SBA program be restored to its pre1982 status. But these pleas have fallen on deaf ears. so it is necessary for us to introduce this legislation and move it quickly to passage. Last year. Mr. CONTE and I introduced a similar bill. H.R. 6189. It. too. was cosponsored by every member of the Subcommittee on Energy. Environment. and Safety Matters Affecting Small Business. We skipped subcommittee markup and took it straight to the full committee where it was incorporated in an omnibus small business bill. That legislation. H.R. 6086. was reported by a unanimuous vote in May 1982. In June its text was substituted for that of S. 1947 and it was sent to the Senate by a voice vote. The Senate declined to act on S. 1947 as amended. because of differences over unrelated portions of the legislation. We have been told that the Senate is in full agreement with the House on the matter of small business pollution control financing. Mr. Speaker. we intend to move this legislation quickly. because an injustice has been done and the remedy is close at hand. Nonetheless. we wish we did not have to do this. By a simple administrative act. the bureaucrats at OMB and SBA couldon their own authorityrestore this worthy program just as surely and just as quickly as they crippled it a year ago. If they would just comply with the stated intent of Congress. it would save everyone a lot of trouble and we could get on with helping small businesses meet their Governmentimposed obligations to improve the environment.e
980041064,Mr. Speaker. when I was securing the necessary cosponsorships. for this resolution. many of my colleagues expressed reluctance to sign any resolution. Ican understand their concerns. Some of the resolutions which have been introduced before this body over the past do not necessarily make substantial contributions to our society. This resolution. I would like to think. has a great deal of significance. Literally thousands of children are dying throughout this country from fatal liver disease. These are lives that in many cases can be saved. Liver disease kills more children in this country than does muscular dystrophy. cystic fibrosis. or leukemia. My own introduction to the problem came when a lovely youn. woman. Denise Attilio. was dying of a liver disease called biliary atresia which kills 400 youngsters each year. I was asked to help in a fundraising endeavor to raise between $50.000 and $100.000 for surgery and hospital care. It was extremely difficult to raise that kind of money in time to save her life. Feeling deeply frustrated and sensing that a life might be lost. I contacted the New York State Department of Health. I asked them to consider funding liver traimplants through the State medicaid pro6Tam. My request was denied. It was the contention of the department of health that the surgical procedure was experimental. not therapeutic. and that the success rate was low. This did not seem to correspond with the information that I had received elsewhere. I thereupon called the Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh and spoke to Dr. Starzl and subsequently with other members of his surgical team. I learned that they performed many of these liver transplant operations at a success rate of approximately 75 percent. Armed with this knowledge. I went back to the department of health and told them that the information they had was inaccurate. I went further and asked them to call the Uhiversity of Pittsburgh and to get the statistics from Dr. Thomas Starz and the hospital. After a period of several days. much to my delight. the State of New York. through its Department of Health. announced that their findings indicated that transplant operations could now be considered therapeutic and that the success rate indeed was quite high. Based upon this information. New York made a decision to change its policy and to provide medicaid coverage for needy persons requiring liver transplants. So Denises application was approved. In recent years. the Presbyterian Hospital has developed a liver transplant operation that is hailed by many medical authorities as a stunning breakthrough in the fight against diseases of the liver. The discovery of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A has been responsible for more than doubling the success rate of liver transplants. The medicaid funding in New York State does include the stipulation that transplant procedures be performed at the University of Pittsburgh with the surgical team headed by Dr. Starzl. The New York State Health Department did indicate that they would agree to evaluate on a case by case basis other hospitals and other surgical teams as they are developed and would expand the coverage in the future. I then wrote to the Governors of each State calling to their attention what happened in New York State and asking them to check with the commissioner of health of the State of New York and follow their example by funding liver transplants through medicaid. Aside from many courtesy responses. I have not received an overwhelming response from States that did. in fact. approve the surgical procedures. Approximately a week and a half ago. a group of parents came to Washington for a press conference which was attended by myself. Congressman JIM COURTER. and Congressman A. GORE. In that room. there were five youngsters who underwent successful liver transplants. There was one young man whose parents told me that the doctors told him he had only. 5 days to live when Dr. Stardl performed the surgical transplant. That operation. my colleagues. took place 9 years ago. Now the young man is about 16. obviously in a good state of health and obviously very happy. There was another young lady who had a liver transplant when she was 8 months old. That was over 6 years ago and her parents asked me to take a picture of her. I had to lift her upshe was a chubby. happy little child. Then there were the other ones in the roomthe sad ones. The ones that were too ill to be able to stand up. Children whose parents were living in hope but facing despair. Children whose skin was severely jaundiced. whose abdomens were bloated. Their parents were seeking a chance to save their lives. The purpose of this resolution is to attempt to educate. not just the Members of this body. but the community at large. A number of Members informed me when I asked them to sign on as a cosponsor that they were involved back home. trying to raise money on a vouluntary basis to fund surgery to save a childs life with a similar disease. It should not be necessary for them to go through that arduous procedure. Indeed. lives can be lost. and will be lost. while they are attempting to raise the money. One purpose of this resolution is to let the world know that lives can be saved. that there is a procedure available and that the success rate is high. I would h6pe that my colleagues in the other States would bring home to their respective commissioners of health and their Governors the story of what occurred in New York State. It would probably be accurate for me to say that every single Member of Congress has a child residing in their congressional district who will be a candidate for a liver transplant in the future. So my colleagues. this is not a frivolous resolution. This is a resolution that has a very serious goal which is to try to foster greater understanding throughout the country. The faster that we can educate ourselves. and our respective States. as to the great promise that there is out there. the more lives that we can save. Time is an enemy of those who are afflicted with one of the fatal diseases. Securing donors is sometimes as difficult as raising the $100.000 to cover the extensive surgery and the extensive hospital costs as well as the postoperative costs involved in these procedures. I wish I could say that the story of Denise Attilio had a happy ending. but I cannot. Denise passed away about 6 months ago. She was a beautiful woman who spent her last year trying to help others who were desperately in need of donors and. in fact. secured. a number of donors throughout the country for others who were afflicted with fatal liver diseases like herself. Let me read to you some of Denise Attilios thoughts. I was always on the sidelines. just watching. I couldnt concentrate in school. I never really was healthy in my whole life. When I was ten. I was told I would die. She was born without a bile duct. which meant the bile produced by her liver could not get out of the liver and into the intestinal tract. So the bile backed up. invading her tissues and ravaging her body and her life. When she thought her condition may have stabilized. she went for a checkup only to learn that she had a year to live. This is how she felt: I was shocked. They said that after that. everything inside would be no good. They told me that the only way I could get well was through a transplant. The scariest part is waiting. Its a form of slow poisoning. I dont know when something is going to happen. Its like cancer. Here is what Denise had to say following her transplant operation: I feel like Im reborn. for the first time in my life. Im healthyl I feel like a million dollars Since I had my transplant two weeks ago. they did eight others who also are doing greatt Doctor Tom Starzl and his team of surgeons do great work and the transplants really shouldnt be considered experimental anymore. The results are marvelous. I hope that no one else has to fight with medicald to get this kind of operation. it is a life and death situation. She once said of the family who donated their deceased childs liver for her transplantation: They are so wonderful. Maybe more will think to donate to give someone else a chance. These peolile and their caring gave me a chance. In their fight for life Denise Attillo and Brandon Hall left with all of us a powerful legacynow it is up to us to respond.
980088369,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of House Resolution 180 introduced by the gentleman from Georgia which would reQuire the certification of new facts to the U.S. attorney with respect to the Gorsuch contempt matter. This resolution. hopefully. will pass the House of Representatives today and mark the end of a sad chapter in the relationship between the executive and legislative branches of our Government. If there is any lesson to be learned from the events that transpired during the past year. it would seem to me that the very least should be an awareness that the confrontation that took place between the two branches never should have occurred. It was a terrible mistake of judgment by some Individual or individuals who were never fully identified. So. that even as we debate this resolution today. we are still not sure of the precise parties who created this conflict which resulted in a tremendous loss of time on the part of several congressional committees as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice. When the original contempt resolution came before the House of Representatives on December 16. 1982. many of my Republican colleagues were critical of the gentleman from Georgia (ELIuoTT LEvITAS) chairman of the Investigations and Oversight Subcommitee of the Public Works and -Transportation Committee. There were concerns expressed during the floor debate that this was a rash act. that Congress was moving too quickly. and that we should have allowed more time to attempt to work out a reasonable compromise. The cold. hard facts were that we were unable to reach such an agreement and that many months were consumed in a vain attempt to do so. If the House was to fulfill its important oversight responsibility of examining the management of the Superfund law through its committees and subcommittees. it was Imperative that we have access to Environment Protection Agency files. To have accepted the administrations position on executive privilege with respect to the documents would have had the effect of eviscerating our Inquiry. I do not wish to recount the events that took place thereafter except to comment that they were somewhat bizarre. The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia did not promptly take the matter before the grand jury in the District of Columbia as required by law. and the Department of Justice chose to thwart the will of Congress by instituting a civil action against the House of Representatives to set aside the criminal contempt resolution adopted by the House. The illconceived suit was quickly dismissed by Federal Court Judge Smith with the admonition that the matter should be resolved by negotiation and compromise between the two branches of Government without further judicial Involvement. This led to the execution of a memorandum of understanding among Chairman LEVITAS. Fred Fielding. Counsel to the President. and Ed Schmults. Deputy Attorney General. An amended memorandum of understanding was entered Into among the same parties on March 22. 1983. Both agreements provided that when certain conditions on the part of the executive branch were adhered to to the satisfaction of Chairman LEviTAs. he would introduce a resolution which would endeavor to purge Mrs. Anne Gorsuch Burford of contempt. Formal hearings were conducted by the subcommittee which clearly established that all of the conditions to be performed by the administration were fully met. I am now fully satisfied that the Public Works Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight has complete access to files necessary for the Superfund investigation. Subcommittee staff. both minority and majority. have interviewed many EPA personnel and examined numerous Superfund enforcement sensitive and confidential files both at headquarters and two regional offices. As far as I am concerned. the subcommittee has enjoyed full and complete access to the Agencys files. In my judgment. it is now our responsibility to complete this matter and adopt the Instant resolution. Historically. I would like to point out that the issue arose in my congressional district when Chairman LEVITAS. at my request. toured several toxic dump sites in New York and New Jersey and subsequently agreed to convene an inquiry into EPAs administration of Superfund. When EPA refused to cooperate in the Inquiry. it led to the unprecedented confrontation that took place. Had we not moved forward with a criminal contempt resolution. we still would be unable to have access to the files necessary for us to proceed with this extremely important work which affects every citizen in the United States. There were several significant points that emerged around the time that Congress voted in favor of the crimilnal contempt resolution. We should remember that Mrs. Burford was directed by the President not to release the socalled enforcement sensitive documents and that similar admonitions were given to her by the Department of Justice. We subsequently learned that Mrs. Burford was actually willing and anxious to give open access of all files to our subcommittee. At the same time. we became involved in some very complicated legal questionsthe issue of executive privilege. the question of whether one Congress can purge a contempt resolution of another Congress. the role of the Department of Justice. possible conflict of interest problems and other serious issues. I would like to pay special tribute to the gentleman from Georgia for the responsible. bipartisan approach that he maintained throughout this controversy. There were some who would try to convert this Into a political issue. but Mr. LEVxITAs maintained a steady course. looking solely for answers and informationnot retribution. Given the history of this entire sorry episode. it was probably inevitable and no doubt necessary. in order to restore public confidence in the Agency that the problems at EPA highlighted during this period resulted in mass dismissals of upper level agency personnel and needed changes in Superfund policy. The new Administrator. Bill Ruckelshaus. has been seclaimed by leaders of both parties as the right person for the job. and I am optimistic that. given the proper resources. he will be able to set about fulfilling the assignments and statutory mandates that were given to EPA. Mrs. Burford resigned many months ago and. since her resignation. was totally incapable of playing any role In effectuating the agreements that were reached with the administration in providing access to Superfund files. As one who was a rather severe critic of Mrs. Burford while she was the Administrator and. one who argued strongly in favor of the original contempt resolution. I now say. in the spirit of fairness. we have achieved our goal and she should no longer live with this cloud over her head. Our traditional American sense of fair play should compel us to move forward and adopt this resolution. We have diverted much too much of our limited time to this confrontation. and the quicker we are able to put this matter behind us. the better we will be able to move on to other. now more important. issues. August . 1983 I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
980095233,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong opposition to this (coal slurry pipeline) legislation. My opposition is based on two major problems In this bill. First. the unprecedented nature of the Federal eminent domain power this legislation permits and. second. the serious environmental problems that this legislation falls to address and. in fact. encourages. In the early part of this debate. this bill was described as enormously complex. It is more than thatit is also a dangerous precedent. Other Members have gotten up on the floor and said there is nothing unique about this legislation. It has been granted to railroads. to oil companies. and for natural gas pipelines. But let us not pass these statements by too quickly. The fact is. never before In the history of this country have we granted such vast and farreaching powers of eminent domain and condemnation. We would be gravely wrong to do so now. In the case of railroads. the Federal right of eminent domain was granted since there were no States established at the time. and the railroads could not appeal to States for the right in question. Railroads no longer have the Federal right of eminent domain and must proceed on a StatebyState basis. Natural gas pipelines have the right of Federal eminent domain for one simple reason: It is the only adequate mode of transportation for natural gas. We know this Is not true for coal. With respect to oil pipelines. the grant of Federal eminent domain was an emergency measure during World War II and was limited to several years in scope. The law specifically set an expiration date for the use of this power. I ask my colleagues to consider the effect this legislation will have on our constitutents. For It is the average homeowner. farmer. and landowner who will be paying the real price of this granting of eminent domainand they will be paying dearly. Think of itwith a stroke of a pen. the title to your home or your farm Is taken away from you. The battle then begins to try and secure just compensation. and that usually takes a number of years. Condemnation Is the greatest power we can give. and It must be granted under the most cautious and limited circumstances. The right to own and enjoy property is something that we prize very dearly In our country. As a real estate lawyer practicing for approximately 30 years. I have witnessed some of the most shocking and sickening examples of abuses that are brought about by condemnation. Yes. it can be said that the fifth amendment to the Constitution says. ""Nor shall private property be taken for public use. without just compensation."" But there have been many cases in my own limited experience where the compensation has been far from Just. Passage of this legislation would create an open season. The powers that would be granted are so broad that there Is an invitation to abuse. A false Impression has been created that the coal slurry pipelines would only traverse railroad rights of way. There is no limitation In this bill on the installation of these pipelines except for some protections for some Federal lands. recreational. historic and wilderness areas. Where Is the protection for the many thousands of homeowners. landowners. and farmers Whose lives and livelihood will be disrupted from one end of this country to the other? Have you ever witnessed the trauma of somebody who receives a notice that their home or farm is being taken from them In a condemnation proceeding? Well. I havetoo many times. The fifth amendment to the Constitution states that private property can only be taken when a public use is involved. This bill states that the construction of coal slurry pipelines is a public use. in our national interest. and therefore. the granting of Federal eminent domain powers Is warranted. But is this what our Founding Fathers meant when they used the term. public use? Did they envision the unlimited and broad Implications and ambiguities that are contained in this legislation? I think not. In my judgment. they intended it to be used very sparingly and only in cases of emergency or where there Is no other alternative. If this bill were to become a precedent. we could justify virtually any form or condemnation by reading into legislation some public benefit or national Interest that would flow from Prospective condemnation. We are stretching the term public use much too far In this legislation. A coal slurry company could run a pipeline to an export facility In a coastal city without any of the coal being used In this country at all. In fact. three of the presently proposed pipelines will be used solely for coal exporting. I would just like to spend a. brief minute on the environmental risks that would be created by this legislation. There are two major hazards of slurry pipelines from an operational standpoint: plugging and breakage. Pipeline failures are not unique events. They occur now all too frequently. Friction and abrasion are Inherent in pipeline movement. Coal slurry pipelines are not like oil pipelines which are segmented and can be shut off. The slurry must be flushed out through the breakage and dumped into a holding pond. We know that some of these pipelines will be traversing very envirornentally sensitive areas. We do not know where the breaks or spillage will occur. but we do know that they will occur. Obviously. every area adjacent to a coal slurry pipeline will be subject to risk. and some environmentally sensitive areas could be irreversibly damaged by such an event. My colleagues from urban areas should not think that these pipelines will not go near- their districts. I had a coal slurry pipeline proposed for my own district in New York City. The potential for public safety and environmental catastrophies from a pipeline in such a densely populated area was enormous. This bill is carefully and deliberately worded so that environmental concerns carry very little weight in the certification process. Specific time limits are put on each phase of the certification process so that those making the decisions will be forced to act In many cases without adequate Information on the specific pipeline in question. This is a very deliberate move on the part of the coal slurry companies since they know that the more time anyone has to look at the real implications of these pipelines. the less the chance they have of being certified. This bill provides that there will be no Federal standards regarding design. Installation. construction. initial Inspection. and initial testing for a pipeline which"" has had a final environmental Impact statement prepared. I am sure If this bill passes. we will see a flurry of environmental impact statements being prepared so that the statements are in place before any regulations are issued. In short. my colleagues. by voting for this bill. you are giving the coal slurry companies the Power to take land from your constituents and putting in a coal slurry pipeline. And you. even as a Member of Congress. will have little power to insure that the public health and safety of your constituents is even considered when the pipeline Is constructed and In operation. I urge you to vote against this dangerous. precedentsetting legislation. While It benefits a few companies. it does so at the expense of your constituents."
980106930,"Mr. Speaker. slightly over 1 month ago the world bore witness to what can only be described as a flagrant violation of human rights and human life. Regardless of what Soviet motivations were during the early morning hours of September 1. the unavoidable fact remains that the lives of 269 people were disregarded by .the leadership of a major world power. Since that day. many conclusions have been drawn from both the attack and the behavior of the Kremlin afterward about the nature of the Soviet military and the conscience of the Soviet leadership. We now must attempt to narrow the focus of our discussion In order to concentrate on what these events will mean for various facets of U.S.U.S.S.R. relations. The fact that the Kremlin views human life from a different perspective than the majority of the civilized world should not come as any great shock. There is no clearer example than the ongoing persecution of Jews in the Soviet Union. The issue of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union has become a focal point of criticism for those who value the right to choose ones home and freely join ones family. I am deeply disturbed that as of August of this year. only 934 Jews had emigrated from the Soviet Union. This is appalling when compared to the first 8 months of 1979. when 33.553 left. We must make this escalation in human suffering a more integral part of our overall relationship with the Soviets. The Helsinki process. as perpetuated in Madrid. Is one approach. the time has come to look for others. Emigration is by no means the only problem besetting the Soviet Jew today. The Shcharanskys. Beguns. and Paritskys are many. and all are prisoners of a system that recognizes nothing about freedom of thought. freedom to celebrate ones heritage and freedom to practice ones faith. For these reasons. it is Imperative that the Kremlin continue to hear from those of us who are concerned. It is equally important that the persecuted know that we are carrying their voices for them. There is yet another. even more virulent and destructive malady which afflicts the Kremlin. I am referring to antiSemitism. a disease that took root during the czarist period. but has returned to Yuri Andropovs Soviet Union In full force. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article written by William Korey of Bnai Brith. a book has recently been published in the Soviet Union called ""The Class Essence of Zionism."" This flagrantly antiSemitic work has been endorsed by the official Soviet press. The book. written by Lev Korneyev. has been praised by Izvestia as ""rich in factual material."" An example of such factual material reads as follows: ""AntiSemitism In Russia was caused by the disgust on the part of the native population for the peculiar psychological and behavioral traits of the Jewish bourgeoisie."" Endorsed by the Kremlin. such hateful statements are compounded only by a blatant implementation of their distorted message. The emergence of Yuri Andropov has ushered In a multitude of policy reversals. including the establishment of the AntiZionist Committee. Since Chairman Andropov assumed his current role. contact between Soviet Jews and Jews abroad has been all but forbidden. The core of Jewish law and tradition. the Talmud and the Torah. have been branded ""extreme fanaticism and chauvinism"" by Soviet authorities and sychophants. A person whose name has become all too familiar to us. losef Begun. defied such policies by teaching the Hebrew language and culture. He now faces a criminal trial that could lead to a 12year prison term. What Bnai Briths William Korey called Moscows AntiSemitic Revival Is symptomatic of a deeper. more insidious kind of persecution that threatens to smother the very vitality of a people. We need to follow the example of Anatoly Shcharansky who. though only halfway Into his 13year sentence. continues to stand for vigilance and freedom. His wife. Avital. also remains a beacon to the world that there is always hope and that no gain is too small. We are truly in a period of rethinking our relationship with the Soviet Union. Our principal goals. however. must not change. The maintenance of global peace Is still. and should always be. our prime objective. Peace Is also a term that applies to Individual human beings. This is why I believe It Is incumbent upon all of us to continue to be vigilant and to speak with a clear voice when another nation defies universally- agreed upon principles of human conduct.o"
980126876,"Mr. Chairman. the primary poarpose of the Resource Conservation anzi Recovery Act under subtitle C. Is ""cradletograve"" management of hazardous wastes. As a cornerstone of the act. effective hazardous waste oversight is essential to protecting human health and the environment. Yet. a significant loophole exists in RCRA which places the health and environment of our Nation in jeopardy. Under the hazardous waste regulatory program. all hazardous waste which passes through a publicly owned treatment works is exempt from Federal regulation. Indeed. any hazardous waste generator may dispose of virtually any waste Into any sewer provided that the sewerline is connected to a publicly owned treatment plant. This unqualified exclusion invites abuse. Generators can use the cheapest method to dispose of their wastessimply dumping it down the sewer. This exemption does not refer to an insignificant quantity of wastes. The Office of Technology Assessment concluded that wastes which currently escape the Federal definition and regulation pose substantial hazards. OTA estimated that wastes currently exempted from RCRA probably total several million tons per year. The situation is grave when we consider the state of our Nations sewage systems. Many cities share the same structural problems in their sewage systems as New York City. Installed largely in the 19th century. and extended as the population grew. the New York City pipes and tunnels were built to receive both sewage and storm water. During the heavy rainfall. the pipes overflow. possibly spilling hazardous wastes. A recent article published by the New York Times discussed the problems experienced by New York City and Boston. problems typical for over 200 coastal cities. In Boston. for example. when the volume Is too great for the pipeline network. the overflow discharges through more than 100 outfalls along the rivers and harbor front. This amonts to about 6 billion gallons annually of raw sewage which feeds out through the combined sewer outfalls Into the waterways. As many of the plants generating much of that sewage are allowed to dump hazardous material into the pipes. during overflows. hazardous wastes spill directly into Boston waters. Once the sewage reaches the publicly owned treatment works. there is still no guarantee that the waste will be adequately treated. Most publicly owned treatment works are capable of only primary treatment even though the Clean Water Act requires secondary treatment. A survey conducted by JRB Associates identified that only 25 percent of the 2.000 pUblicly owned treatment works sampled had the essential mechanisms in place to control Industrial waste. The amendment which I offer today would address this problem. It requiires EPA to prepare a report to the Congress within 15 months of enactment specifying the Agencys progress in quantifying. as accurately as possible. the nature and scope of hazardous waste disposal into domestic sewers. including the types of wastes and waste streams. the extent to which this exclusion is justified and should be modified or eliminated. and the adequacy of pretreatment as a means of dealing with this problem. The Administrator will then be required to revise existing regulations and promulgate additional regulations as deemed necessary. This study will look at all the laws governing waste disposal and attempt to integrate the functions of those laws. It is an attempt to get a handle on this problem and deal with it in the most effective manner. If our environmental laws are intended to insure safe disposal of hazardous wastes. a loophole which permits generators to essentially dump their wastes down the sewer appears to contradict that objective. I be.ieve my amendment represents a first step toward addressing this situation.-"
980127009,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise In support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania. This measure is long overdue. We know that our ground water resources are threatened with contamination and depletion. yet we lack comprehensive Information on the nature and scope of these threats. Six Federal statutes. many of which overlap. govern aspects of ground water problems. Additionally. State protection mneasures are inconsistent. fragmentary. and limited. A Commission will transcend this jurisdictional confusion and objectively determine the best remedial and preventive action to take. .Controlling ground water contamination poses unique problems. Unlike pollution of the air or surface waters. ground water pollution travels slowly. Therefore. ground water pollution which occurred decades ago may now be appearing in parts of aquifers used for water supply. Similarly. ground water pollution occurring today may not appear for decades. As of 1982. EPA located over 180.000 waste Impoundments at some 80.000 sites. Of the industrial landfill sites evaluated in the Agencys surface impoundment assessment. 70 percent were found to be unlined. 50 percent were sitting directly on top of ground water aquifers. and 98 percent were located within 1 mile of a water supply well. The Council on Environmental Quality estimated that serious contamination of ground water by toxic t.ynthetic organic chemicals had occurred in 34 States. Within the last few years. for example. public wells have been closed In 22 communities in Massachusetts. 16 in Connectlcut. 25 in Pennsylvania. and 22 In New York. Over 100 private wells have been closed in New Jersey and 500 In Long Island. Hence. the need for a comprehensive study of our national ground water situation Is clear. It will provide us a sound basis for determining how to Integrate Federal. State. and local responsibilities so that they work together as effectively as possible. As the proper mechanisms for dealing with these problems are installed. we will gain better control of ground water at the source and thereby prevent future calamities. Once an aquifer is contaminated. the process of reclaiming it is a difficult and expensive one. The natural rate of ground water recharge Is on the order of decades. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as a wise step toward saving our most precious resourcewater.
980153358,Mr. Chahman. I rise in support of this legislation. The EnvironmentAl Protection Agencys research and development program is a vital component of the Agencys regulatory network. Indeed. almost all decisions made by EPA are based upon the knowledge gained through R&D pursuits. Today. we witness new chemicals entering the environment. increasing waste disposal problems. lifethreatening ground water contamination and rising levels of public health ailments linked to toxic pollutants. Accelerated research and innovation will be crucial to meet these challenges. Mr. Chairman. we have heard mention today about the problem of dioxin. What has not been mentioned. and I think it is very significant. is that the serious problem of garbage disposal in this country has been held up to a large extent because of the fear of the unknown. how dangerous dioxins are. I think when we can come to grips with that problem and be able to insure the public that we can build resourcesrecovery facilities that are safe from this threat of dioxin we will be able to get on with the job. I am also pleased to see that we are putting money into the acidrain budget. That is a problem that has become a big political issue and we have States suing each other. Canada is threatening to sue the United States. And we are mad at Canada. New York State has sued nine other States. It is time that the Federal Government is taking a hand here and to provide some of the answers that we need. This Is a good start. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Chairman. we rely heavily upon the scientific community to research longterm health effects and the dynamics of the environment. The administration has repeatedly called for improved scientific data prior to implementing new regulations. I place great faith in the ability of vigorous research to develop new solutions to prevent any future environmental hazards. However. I cannot stress enough the importance of allocating funds and resources in a careful manner. Simply throwing additional moneys at the Agency will prove costly and ineffective. Through conscientious allocation of our resources. we will get a great deal more value for our dollar. This bill is designed to authorize funds in the most effective manner and it is my hope that EPA will follow this legislative direction by implementing these funds wisely. I commend the committee for its diligent work and careful evaluation in drafting this legislation. It addresses every major division in EPAs R&D program and provides continuity in the program by authorizing funds for 2 fiscal years. I especially applaud the committees attention to the issue of resource recovery. Many localities are faced with a dilemma similar to my own. Municipal refuse is building up to uncontrollable proportions and alternative disposal methods are urgently needed. Resource recovery can provide an effective solution. I am. therefore. pleased to see the committee addressing the problems incurred by the Hempstead plant so that plans and construction for future resourcerecovery facilities can go quickly forward. Sufficient funding for EPAs R&D Is long overdue. If we are to avoid the mistakes of the past and safeguard public health and the enviroment. control technology will have to meet the challenges posed by the evergrowing. wasteproducing technology. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
980261311,"I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker. I think that if we consider a fair approach to thisand I think that the point should be made that we are not here to close down the Kennedy Centerwe would like to see it run. more efficiently. more profitably. and I think it can be. We are not tryikpg to do anything to cut back on the program of Kennedy Center. But the gentleman from Florida has pointed out this sharp increase in revenues that has occurred. and in 1987 the projections are that it will be. at the present level. $3 a parking ticket. over $800.000. And you know what that means? It means that if they paid 50 percent of that $800.000 to the Treasury under the compromise plan. they would pay $400.000. an amount less than what they are paying today to banks. So we questioned those who say they do not have the ability to pay it. And. for heavens sake. the preposterous response. when we suggested. ""If you have a financial problem. why not consider a modest increase in your parking revenues?"" The response that we got was. ""Hey. the patrons at Kennedy Center feel that they should have parking for nothing."" That is the answer that we received. Mr. Speaker. as I said initially. I am very distressed at the background of this bill. For 6 months we have been tracking it. We spent 2 solid months in goodfaith negotiations with Treasury. with the trustees of Kennedy Center. with OMB. with our colleagues. We fashioned an agreement that was more than fair. The Kennedy Center trustees were not satisfied. I am terribly disappointed in them. I think they have done a disservice to Congress and to the people of this country. For my own part. I would like to see the whole lock. stock. and barrel leave and have some competent individuals take over. people who would be reasonable and rational. and who would not have snubbed the House as they did in this particular case. They have not had the courtesy to advise the Senate of the negotiations and the agreement that had been reached. I hope that we would have the opportunity to debate this on the floor so that our colleagues can share in the knowledge of what. transpired for 2 solid months. but It does not appear that we will. For that reason. we have chosen to take the course today of bringing out the facts as we know them on a special order. At this point I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Florida."
980277179,"I thank the gentleman. Let me call to the attention of the Members of the body a missal that appeared underneath our doors tonight. I am sure some of you did not see it. It was sent out by the Department of the Treasury. I will read just one portion: ""We want you particularly to know that the Kennedy Center and Treasury never accepted any alternative proposal nor was any formally presented."" Now that is what we are dealing with. There is Treasury denying the statement that was made by the gentleman from Georgia. That is what we are up against. Let me tell you what we are doing here or trying to do. We are not trying to close Kennedy Center down. what we are trying to do is to preserve it and we have geared a bill that is geared to the ability of the Kennedy Center to pay. They cannot pay $3.3 million compounded interest. they cannot pay simple interest of $1.2 million a year. but they can pay something. Under our compromise. understand what we are talking about. we are gearing it to what they are receiving. 50 percent of what they are receiving come to the Treasury. The first $250.000 or 50 percent. whichever is greater. goes to reduction. immediately. of principal indebtedness and the balance. whatever it is. is treated as interest. Now think about what happens the first year that it is triggered. in 1987. $800.000 the GAO says is going to be paid to the Center. They would pay Treasury $400.000. $250.000 is credited to principal and we get the magnanimous sum of $150.000 in interest. not $3.3 million compound interest. not $1.2 million simple interest. $150.000. Now it gets me sick when I hear people get up and talk about how Mr. Stevens of Kennedy Center is so upset at the compounding of interest that occurred here. What difference does it make. I ask you. whether the interest was compounded or not? They do not want to pay any interest. Now let us talk about the real difference between the bailout passed by the other body and espoused by some people here. What we are offering is a reasonable compromise. Instead of $6 million being paid they will pay $20.4 million in principal and. yes. we do waive the $33 million in pastdue interest. We have not fashioned a hard deal. In addition to that. we are going to be collecting some interest for the taxpayers and as the principal goes down that interest is going to go up. Members should know that right now they have paid out almost $3 million in interest to APCOA. the concessionaire. the parking garage concessionaire. for the lease that they have. and they are paying $697.000 this year to American Security Bank. $500.000 in principal. $197.000 in Interest. but they cannot pay a dime to the taxpayers. Now we have asked this bill to be brought up for the. last 6 months so that we can have a full airing of it. We do not want to close Kennedy Center. You talk about Kennedy Center and you invoke the name of a President we all love. it is like talking about the Statue of Liberty. It is sacrilegious to get up here and speak against it. But. damn it. somebody has to come up and talk some sense and say let us come up with a reasonable proposal. We do not want to close Kennedy Center. Nobody has suggested that they cannot pay some interest to the taxpayers. and I am saying they can. They are charging $3 for parking. Now let me just conclude by saying this to you: They say they cannot raise their parking fees from $3 to $4. Why? Because they are going to lose customers who are paying $40 to $55 a ticket for some events. Now let me just bring to your attention that Lincoln Center. my friends. Lincoln Center in New York City charges $15 to park. five times what the Kennedy Center is charging. and the nearby lots charge $10 to $13. They netted last year $2 million. That is what we are talking about."

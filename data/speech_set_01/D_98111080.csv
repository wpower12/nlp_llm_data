980011130,"Mr. Chairman. today. my colleagues and I are called upon to cast our vote on the single most important issue to face us this sessionsocial security. It is with deep regret that I rise in opposition to the Social Security Act amendments as reported by the Ways and Means Committee. After careful and painful analysis. I have concluded that these provisions are neither fair nor responsible. and enactment. could only serve to further erode the confidence of the American people in the social security system. The delay in costofliving adjustments is an unacceptable provision that would place intolerable hardship on social security beneficiaries. No equitable solution can deny the funds designated to offset inflation from recipients. many of whom count on social security as their sole source of income. I also reject the inclusion of newly hired Federal workers into the system. While this would provide an immediate cash injection. the system would shortly face recurring financial problems as Federal employees start to collect benefits. In reality. no meaningful structural changes are established with the inclusion of Federal workers into the system. Additionally. one important incentive to attract qualified people into Federal service would disappear if the civil service retirement system atrophied. Because it would place unfair burden on the individual. I do not support raising the age of retirement or the reduction of the basic benefits received by the retired worker from 42 percent to 40 percent of previous monthly gross pay at the time of retirement as scheduled to be phased in from the years 2000 to 2008. It is incumbent upon Congress to innovate new and relatively painless sources of income to help fund the Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance program. I have recently reintroduced H.R. 85. the ""National Social Security Lottery Act."" which would establish a national lottery similar to the Irish Sweepstakes. If the Irish can fund their hospitals through a lottery. we should be able to held fund social security in the same manner. It is estimated that a national lottery could gross upwards of $25 billion over the next 7 years. the period of time the Commission addressed in their short term proposals. This would significantly lessen the number of unpopular compromises that would otherwise be necessary to keep the system solvent. A national lottery. however. is no panacea. Other avenues must also be explored in an effort to identify new sources of income. I urge the Congress not to act hastily. The outcome of this vote will shape the financial futures of millions of Americans.*"
980015355,Mr. Chairman as an original cosponsor of House Joint Resolution 13. I rise to express my unequivocal support for the House Joint Resolution 13. and welcome this opportunity to help remove the threat of nuclear annihilation from our lives. The nuclear arms race is presently out of control. Everyone acknowledges that there is no such thing as victory in a war fought with nuclear weapons. Yet the United States and the Soviet Union continue to stockpile billions of dollars in hardware they dare not use. Not only does a tensionfilled arms race increase the risk that the unthinkable could happen. but it is an expensive diversion of resources that seems to be all the more ridiculous in light of our social security financing problems. the current 12percent unemployment rate and the ravenous cuts made in many of our Nations social programs under the Reagan administration. Nevertheless. the administration has proposed a $1.7 trillion defense budget over the next 5 years. There is now sufficent nuclear parity between the United States and the Soviet Union to institute a nuclear freeze. Measured by accuracy and the total number of warheads. the United States seems to be out front. Judging by delivery systems and explosive force. the Soviet Union would appear to have the upper hand. It is obvious that these strengths and weaknesses work to balance each other. In calling for a nuclear freeze. the Congress is not initiating any ideas. We are. however. responding to the loud clamor of the American people. Nuclear freeze referendums have been enacted in 12 countries. 9 States. and 22 cities. Additionally. nuclear freeze resolutions have been endorsed by 125 city councils. and 13 State legislatures. We have the opportunity before us today to take a positive step toward ending the nuclear arms race. This is one of the most important issues this Congress.. or indeed any Congress. has had to deal with. Our choice is clear. We must move America and the world a step closer to a safer and brighter future. I urge passage of this resolution.
980027962,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 1983. a bill that would provide relief from foreclosure for thousands of unemployed homeowners. Last year. the Subcommittee on Manpower and Housing. which I chaired. examined the Department of Housing and Urban Developments efforts on behalf of financially hardpressed FRA homeowners. I think that what we found is significant. HUD currently operates the mortgate assignment program. HUD purchases mortgages of FHAinsured homeowners who are unabled to make payments for reasons beyond their control. such as unemployment. sickness. or uninsured loss. The mortgages are purchased from the original banks. IIUD thus becomes the bank to the homeowner. and mortgage payments are adjusted downward to the homeowners reduced income level. HUD is currently attempting to change from the assignment program to the temporary mortgage assistance program. to handle FHAinsured mortgages. This program is known as TMAP and is similar to the program which we are now considering. TMAP has been held up by a Legal Services suit which alleges that TMAP is unequal to mortgage assignment. My subcommittees oversight of TMAP and assignment indicates that Congress cannot simply enact a program and expect HUD to implement it. HUD had a record of narrowly construing regulations. In 1987. of the 150.000 FHA homeowners who were 90 days delinquent. only 3.000 were accepted into assignment. To begin with. HUD assistance to homeowners has been imposed on HUD by the courts. HUD never wanted the program. HUD has given it inadequate manpower and HUD has withheld mortgage counseling money and tried to limit the advocacy role played by mortgage counselors. I bring this to your attention because I think that EMAP may not get a positive reception from HUD. If HUD processes applications too slowly. bank and mortgage companies will not want to participate. If HUD makes repayment schedules too short. then homeowners may not be able to quallfy for assistance. If HUD does not advertise the availability of emergency mortgage assistance. then few applications will be made. Finally. if HUD does not give the personal attention needed to help families adjust their budgets. then EMAP will have a high secondary default rate. The assignment program and TMAP are cost effective. HUD sales of repossessed houses are often a few cents on the dollar. To keep the family in the house. at least making normal mortgage payments is much preferable than foreclosure. Add to that the blight that boarded up and abandoned houses cause in neighborhoods and anyone can see the value of homeowner assistance. It was evident. however. that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has not seen the same value. I do not expect HUD to react any more positively to this program. I congratulate the chairman of the Housing Subcommittee for championing this legislation. and I recommend he monitor it once enacted. Mr. Chairman. I support H.R. 1983. I urge its adoption. especially in this time of economic dislocation. Mortgage assistance is a selfevident need.e
980038160,Mr. Speaker. as the author of antitampering legislation. H.R. 778. which states my commitment to consumers as well as manufacturers. I support the need to make it a Federal crime to knowingly tamper with consumer products which result in injury or death to the purchaser of such products. In all honesty. however. I strongly feel two vital provisions are missing fromH.R. 2174. a measure which has been brought to the House floor today under suspension of the rules and not subject to amendment. Those pieces are: Language which addresses the damage done to the reputation of manufacturers. wholesalers. retailers. and so forth. as the result of malicious tampering. and the imposition of stronger sentences in order to deter product tampering. Who in these hallowed Halls of Congress can forget picking up the newspaper last year and reading about the deaths of several people in Chicago who died from cyanide poisoning after taking extrastrength Tylenol capsules? Who can forget about the copycat tamperings which followed days after the tragic events of September 30. 1982? Products were adulterated In an effort to harm people. to damage a business reputation and. in some cases. simply for the perverse pleasure of wreaking havoc with a nation of consumers and manufacturers. Those crimes. inspired by the Chicago incidents. succeeded in gripping the American people with the fear that their overthecounter drugs might be poisonous. My colleagues would certainly agree that consumers have the right to purchase products without apprehension or fear that they may be playing a very deadly game of Russian roulette. Similarly. members of the business community have the right to do business without fear that their products or reputations will be damaged. Some manufacturers have had to recall massive numbers of items which had been tampered with. Others are absorbing the cost of recalling their products at the drop of a hoax. So. while I am pleased with the speed with which the House is considering Federal legislation to outlaw product tampering and the fact that the legislation before us is stronger than what we passed in the 97th Congress. I am sorry that during the subcommittee deliberation. language was not approved which would deter anyone from damaging a business reputation. It should be noted. however. that after presenting testimony before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime in support of my legislation. the subcommittee ultimately marked up this bill which. first. provides three different types of punishment focusing on people conveying false information. second. broadens the scope of products and third. makes It a crime to tamper with the labels or containers of covered products. Inasmuch as this bill is the closest we could come to addressing concerns echoed by the business community. I urge my colleagues to support it and to thereby provide a mechanism to deter such madness in the future.e
980125617,"Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 1234. the Fair Practices in Automotive Products Act. As a cosponsor of this legislation. I sincerely believe that Its passage will benefit our economy by helping to balance our trade deficit with Japan and put back to work hundreds of thousands of unemployed auto workers. H.R. 1234 requires all auto manufacturers selling more than 100.000 vehicles in the United States to include in their cars specific levels of American generated content for each model year. This would encourage the production of automotive products here. The legislation also establishes an Industry advisory council within the Department of Transportation and directs the council to formulate a strategy to increase the domestic production of automotive products. Opponents of this legislation argue that this is ""protectionism."" It is not. It Is an attempt to redress a very serious imbalance In the socalled free trade system. A system which presently allows foreign competitors to dump their cheaply made goods on the United States while American firms are unable to sell to them because of high tariffs and similar devices. This problem Is especially acute when it comes to the United StatesJapanese trade problem. At a time when our_ economy is struggling to keep afloat. we in Congress must be willing to use our influence to see that the U.S. auto industry with its thousands of Jobs is protected from unfair competition. It is my sincere belief that unless we take specific steps to retain and protect our local production base we will continue to suffer from the flood of imports. We will also continue to be witness to an Increasing number of our American companies being put at a disadvantage or out of business because foreign competitors benefit from targeted Government assistance. This assistance has allowed our major foreign competitor. Japan. considerable margin to finance quality automotive Improvements and expand their U.S. market share through advertising. Passage of this legislation would also send a strong signal to the administration and Japanese that the United States must seek at least 2 more years of voluntary restraints upon Japanese car imports. It would also prevent U.S. automakers from abandoning plans to build new small cars in the United States and importing cars from Japan. Preventing our own companies from rushing to bring In Imports protects Jobs at U.S. auto plants and people working in the various auto support Industries. We would also be in a position to strongly warn Japan against either increasing Imports from the current level of 1.68 autos to 2.2 million or committing for only I year of voluntary restraint. To do anything less would only increase the number of jobless American autoworkers and our already spiraling trade deficit. As a strong supporter of H.R. 1234. 1 truly believe that its passage would be a first step In devising an American Industrial policy that would combine both domestic and foreign economic policies. We would also encourage foreign automakers to produce their cars in the United States. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and vote for its passage.e"
980134480,Mr. Chairman. I offer this amendment because I have consistently opposed the export of millions of dollars from my State of Illinois. which has a lower local plant cost and is more efficient to subsidize small rural telephone companies In other States. That export provision. which allows for massive transfer of funds from lowcost. highdensity States like Illinois to other States is contained In the rural or highcost fund established under H.R. 4102. Under this mechanism which derives money from surcharges added to long distance calls. Illinois will contribute $27 million and receive less than onehalf million dollars In return. This Is a loss of $26.5 million. As a Member concerned about. first. enhancing and protecting my States growth in high technology areas. second. attracting new Jobs and industry. and third. maintaining dependable and affordable service for lowincome families. I am compelled to take this action to lessen the gross disparity between what Illinois and other highdensity States contribute. Under the present policy. States contributing to lowdensity. highcost areas. like IllinoisIllinois. Itself. In factlose approximately $138 million. Under the FCCs rural fund scheduled to go into effect next year. Illinois would contribute close to double the amount required under this bill. And although we fare much better under H.R. 4102. there is a definite need to reduce that loss even further. A $26.5 million loss to my State Is still too much. That is why this amendment will allow my State and others like Illinois. such as California. New York. New Jersey. Maryland. et cetera. to receive an amount equal to the portion of the surcharges imposed and collected for deposit Into the rural fund. This amendment. If adopted. would correct the Inequity of a system which in effect penalizes the more cost effective systems at the expense of cushionIng rural. Inefficient companies. It is my contention that continued subsidies to the universal telephone service fund which targets money for small rural telephone companies will continue to have an adverse impact upon my constituents opportunities for future high technology jobs. I firmly believe this inequity will not serve the future needs for our country. As a matter of fact. if we look at this chart. wve see States such as Illinois making vast contributions. and I am concerned when I see that the major benefactors of contributions such as we are making In the State of Illinois are States like Alaska and Texas and Arkansas and Wyoming. and others. which have very high per capita income. It seems to me there Is no reason for the ratepayers in my district to contribute money to a fund that would benefit States with those higher per capita Incomes. I think It Is wrong to take the money out of the pockets of constituents In. say. New York or California. Illinois. and other States who are high contributors and send It to people who are certainly financially able to take care of their own needs.
980150227,Mr. Chairman. as a strong supporter of the need to provide Federal moneys for the prevention and treatment of child abuse. I rise today in support of H.R. 1904. child abuse amendments of 1983. It is indeed encouraging to note that finally our Nation is beginning to realize the long- and shortterm effects of child abuse on the individual and our society. It is currently estimated that 1.5 million children in this country are victims of abuse and neglect. It is also estimated that close to 2.000 children die each year under circumstances which suggest child abuse. Such atrocities can only be stopped or prevented if Congress steps in to strengthen and properly fund programs to identify and combat child abuse. It should come as no surprise to any of us in Congress that child abuse incidents are on the rise. There is a direct correlation between high unemployment and cutbacks in social services and mental health funding and the increase in the abuse of children by frustrated adults. Leave it to the President to cure this problem by requesting $9 million in funding in fiscal year 1984 and for pushing through Congress legislation which eliminated funding for sexual abuse programs. Surely any intelligent person could understand the need to fund newly recognized forms of child abuse: child pornography. The bill before us does. to the tune of $3 million. Toward that end. I fully support an amendment to increase funding for sexual abuse prevention. The statistics on sexual abuse are shocking. A confirmed national estimate is that one in four girls are victims of sexual mistreatment by age 18. Let me take this opportunity to highlight a provision of this bill that I firmly believe should not be included. As my colleagues are aware. the Baby Doe issue has surfaced again. This bill now requires that the Health and Human Services Department determine instances where medical care. nutrition. or social services are withheld from infants born with severe. life threatening congenital handicaps. We have absolutely no business legislating this determination. Unfortunately all we will do if we allow this provision to stand is create even more confusion for the courts. That is why I plan to join my likeminded colleagues in voting for the Waxman amendment which. if adopted. will strike this provision. I also support an amendment to authorize money for State grants to support programs to prevent family violence. provide shelter to victims of family violence and direct HHS to study the extent of abuse of the elderly. In closing. let me say that H.R. 1904 provides for $30 million worth of concern. love. and most of all. ACTION. A figure that is approximately onefifth of the price of Just one of the 100 MX missiles the president has requested.e
980169134,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to thank our colleague. Congressman CLARENCE LONa for calling this special order to pay tribute to the late Clarence Mitchell. His death marks the end of one mans successful efforts to promote fairness and Justice for blacks. women. and the handicapped. Mr. Mitchell fought for almost three decades as the NAACPs Washington. D.C.. director and chief lobbyist for civil rights legislation. He was a key player in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Mr. Mitchells compassion and sensitivity toward the human rights of others helped him persist through the years of abuse and threats. He used to say that he knew what his calling was after witnessing a lynching in Princess Anne. Md.. while he was a reporter at the Baltimore AfroAmerican newspaper. So horrified was he by this experience. that one of his first actions after moving to Washington. D.C.. was to testify before Congress supporting an antilynching bill When he had trouble convincing Congress to pass needed civil rights legislation. Mr. Mitchell managed. through his skillful Iobbying tactics. to influence Presidents to issue Executive orders. Famous in my mind was when President Truman ordered the desegregation of the Armed Forces. Action which came about as a result of Mr. Mitchells persuasive ability. Clarence Mitchell also focused attention on school desegregation by picketing the elementary school where his son had been beaten and attacked by whbite students. He ignored their taunts while carrying a sign saying. ""I am an American too."" That same son later became the first black doctor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Mr. Mitchell founded and directed the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. an organization which united 100 active groups seeking equality through the law. His quiet dignity and modesty. along with his talent to reason. made him one of the most respected leaders in Washington and earned him the nickname of ""tle 101st Senator."" That name is ironic since Mr. Mitchell was not even permitted in the Senate oining room or certain Senate elevators at the beginning of his struggle. It was this unfaltering courage to speak out which led to his success in such battles as the prevention of exPresident Nixons Supreme Court nomihations of judges Clement Haynesworth and 0. Harrold Carswell. In 1969. he received the Spingarn Medal. and 11 years later President Carter awarded him with the Nations highest civilian honorthe Presidential Medal of Freedom. Mr. Mitchell also was appointed by President Ford to the U.N. General Assembly. and continued to fight for the rights of his fellow oltizens until he died. I am grieved that such a leader is gone but his achievements are not. He will always be remembered by the thousands of people whose pride was restored by his actions.e"
980233223,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 5541. legislation reauthorizing funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. As a consistent and staunch supporter of this program I am all too keenly aware of the need to properly maintain this necessary medium. During reauthorization hearings before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications. it was brought out that the funding levels requested by CPB were reasonable and justified and that the moneys do not reflect the need for the improved. or expanded levels of service that we would all prefer. Indeed. the money we have authorized is crucial if we are to prevent further erosion of the public broadcast system we have come to enjoy and rely upon so much. While I might like commercial broadcasters to assume a larger responsibility in providing programing for underserved and underrepresented audiences. that has just not been the case. I have championed public broadcasting because they traditionally have met the need for programs that the commercial marketplace has not providedthat is. programming for children. minorities. women. elderly. and the handicapped. Public broadcasting is also the major source for indepth coverage of Congress and national and local news. In short. public broadcasting fills a need the American people have relative to creative and sensitive programing that we just do not see on regular televison. In commending the CPB for their role in providing diverse programing on decreased Federal funds. I must call their attention to a problem I have found need of corrective action. It is my belief that public broadcasting must work harder in ensuring that minorities and women have access to the entire range of benefits and opportunities that Congress have created by this medium. It would appear to me that whilethe Corporation has done an admirable job in childrens programming. much has yet to be done in the way of increasing more training money to minority producers. writers. and increasing the number of minorities hired in decisionmaking positions. What bothers me about this issue is that legislative report language to public broadcasting has been clearthe Corporation must. given the large amount of Federal funds they receive. be more aggressive In bringing blacks and other minorities into the industry. Only through increased employment of minorities can we begin to really offer diverse ideas. view points. and programming. We can no longer tolerate an entity which exists almost solely on Federal funds to promote program diversity. to ignore congressional direction in the equal employment opportunity area. In closing. let me urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation. Public broadcasting is a necessary part of our goal to increasing program diversity.e
980255377,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of House Resolution 430. the Mandela freedom resolution. which calls upon the South African Government to release Nelson and Winnie Mandela from detention. Exhibiting courage and enduring spirit. the Mandelas have become symbols of the freedom struggle of the vast majority of South Africans. who are deprived of their most basic human rights. Though isolated and harassed. this brave couple continues to inspire their fellow citizens to work for a multiracial democracy in which the dignity and humanity of all races would be respected. Nelson Mandela. Imprisoned since August 1962. has gained widespread domestic support and international recognization for his liberation movement. the African National Congress. le has mobilized the nonwhite community.with national strikes. antipass law campaigns and his own personal example of uncompromising opposition to the racist apartheid system. Winnie Mandela has made a substantial contribution to the fight against racism herself. She has been continously banned since 1962 to ever remoter outposts in the Afrikaner heartland where she is under constant police supervision and harassment. She is forbidden to see more than one person at a time and may only visit her husband Nelson once a month for 30 minutes. Nevertheless. she has refused to obey segregation laws and has set up a soup kitchen and an unofficial clinic for her poor neighbors. Continued unrest in all the nonwhite communities. most recently seen in the last few weeks bloody rioting and protest marches. demonstrates the strength of opposition to apartheid. The South African Government must negotiate with the leaders of its black. mixed race. and Indian majority. not imprison them. Thus. I call on this regime to act in its own best interests. as well as those of South Africa. by immediately freeing these two individuals. I further call upon our own Government to convey its support for this action to State President Botha and his cabinet. This administrations policy of constructive engagement with South Africa has too often amounted to quiet support for that oppressed nations vicious rulers. Amerlea must leave no doubt that we oppose apartheid with substantive actions as well as free flowing words. Thus. I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution.e

980024800,"Mr. Speaker. I wish to express my support for H.R. 1035. the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act amendments. A drafting error in the 1981 Omnibus Reconciliation Act caused the unintended termination by fiscal year 1984 of funding for the education of schoolchildren whose parents live or work on Federal property. the category ""B"" children. Consequently. the administrations proposed budget for fiscal year 1984 does not include funding for category ""B"" children as part of impact aid to localities. Elimination of category ""B"" students would clearly result in an unfi.Ir burden on hundreds of jurisdictions throughout the country which do not have a complete property tax base because of the location of Federal facilities within their borders. For example. in 1981 the school board of one of the jdrisdictions in my district sent tuition letters to the parents of impacted children attending the public schools of that jurisdiction. The school board also informed the Defense Department that. it held DOD accountable for 50 percent of the cost of the school systems impacted children. These actions prompted DOD to provide the money for 50.3 percent of the costs of educating the schoolchildren. I submit that this incident demonstrates that we need to retain category ""B"" funding in fiscal year 1984. as the Education and Consolidation and Improvement Act amendments provide. in order to prevent its recurrence nationwide.. School systems across the Nation have already borne substantial reductions in impact aid. One system in my district sustained a 40percent reduc. tion in impact aid last school year and faces another 40percent reduction below that in the fiscal year 1984 administration budget proposal. Another system would be more drastically affected. as eliminating category ""B"" would end that systems impact aid program entirely. after it has already borne reductions in impact approaching $1 million below some recent years. These reductions. followed by the elimination of category ""B"" and combined with new eligibility requirements for receiving impact aid for the education of schoolchildren whose parents live and work on Federal property will cause great hardships for hundreds of jurisdictions. The elimination of category ""B"" will also result in wide and unfair disparities in aid between school districts which have lost comparable portions of their tax bases because of Federal installations. I believe that the fiscal year 1984 budget should and must contain funding for at least 50 percent of the cost of educating federally impacted schoolchildren. both category ""A"" and category ""B."" The first step toward this goal of equity between school systems and fair compensation for educating children whose parents live or work on Federal property can be taken by supporting H.R. 1035. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. the Congressional Budget Office has indicated that there will be no increased costs to the Federal Goveminent because of its enactment."
980062478,Mr. Speaker. I appreciate this opportunity to point out several examples of what I think are the most inequitable situations under this tax bill. This is not tax equity. This bill should be called the Democrats Huge Tax Increase on Middle Americans Act of 1983. because that is exactly what it is. The Washington metropolitan public television station carries these House proceedings live and I sincerely hope that there are a very large number of people out there watching because if they understand what is going to happen to them I hope they will call their Representatives before the vote and let them know what their opinions are about this bill and what their objections to it are. Let me give you just some examples of some of the things I think they should call about. If you are a middleincome American in the Washington metropolitan area. and if you work for a private employer and have taxable income of $30.000 for this year. you had better turn down the opportunity to take a $5.000 bonus because if you earn $35.000 this year instead of $30.000 your income tax marginal rate will increase by almost 50 percent. How many people do you think are going to work overtime? How many will make an investment to increase their income under those circumstance? What are we doing to incentives. to tax savings. and to economic recovery? If you are a GS12 Federal employee or higher your income tax rates will increase under this bill. If both you and your wife work for the Federal Government your taxes will go up if either or both of you are above a GSIf you are a secretary at the Department of Agriculture at the GS4 level who earns about $14.000. married to an analyst at the Department of Commerce at the GS12 level. who earns about $36.000. they will lose $459 of the scheduled rate reduction in 1984. Is it not wonderful that you are considered by our Democrat friends as wealthy and therefore you deserve to have your taxes increased? If you are a small businessman it is estimated that 86 percent of all small businessmen will have their taxes increased. Mr. Speaker. we will have more time to debate this matter under consideration of the bill and I hope we will reject this bill at the conclusion of that debate.
980075954,I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would say to him as he has pointed out. the society of El Salvador and certainly its Government Is not perfect. nor Is ours. Would it not be nice if everywhere on this globe we could eliminate prejudice. bigotry. the violation. in one way or another. of human rights? But I think that is the perfect solution to the ultimate situation which perhaps we will never achieve. but to which we can strive. I think the gentleman made a great point of establishing the fact. and I think we have been furnished some evidence. that there Is a genuine effort in that regard to improve the situation in that nation. And I have in my hand and we were all furnished as has been every military unit in the armed services of El Salvador. a document published by the Minister of Defense Gen. Vides Casanova. that sets forth the required procedures that must be adhered to by the Armed Forces of El Salvador in the area of activities of human rights as it relates to the personnel of that nation. I think that document is very impressive. And I would just add one other comment in response to the gentleman and that is that the question of human rights is one that is very broad. Ask the gentlemen and ladies who have been assassinated through the II15470 violence in El Salvador about their human rights. Ask the people who walk by the soldiers on the streets of El Salvador every day. through the guns that are everywhere in evidence and ask them about their individual freedoms. And ask the refugees who have made their way up through Mexico or however into the confines of this Nation about human rights and see what they say about living in their own community on their land and doing their own thing. And if the gentleman would permit me the privilege of just one moment. let me. for the record. include some brief material developed by the House Republican Research Committee in terms of the question of what kind of impact would this situation have if it turned very badly for the worse in terms of the interests of the United States on the refugee situation. And I say to the gentleman without question that the United States is invariably the preferred final destination of all refugees. Everybody wants to come to the United States for all of the reasons that we know and accept. And it appears that there is a general rule of thumb that you can apply in a simply mathematical exercise regarding the historical trends of refugees coming to this Nation. For example. since Cuba fell to the Communist revolution there has been over 1 million Cuban citizens come to this Nation. which represents over 10 percent of the Cuban population. And that figure. as a base line percentage. conservatively let us use 8 percent. That is what was done in this study. Now if 8 percent of the nations of Central America were to take the historical route to apply for emigration to the United States or simply emigrate here illegally in some way appear on our shores. within the confines of this Nation. it is estimated that those numbers of persons. as a conservative base. would be 9.030.000. The existing laws of the United States would require this Nation to spend in their support $25.235.000.000 per year and if they came here tomorrow. they would make the existing unemployment rate in this Nation almost 13 percent. Now that is the kind of problem. the magnitude of the problem that the President has addressed. that the gentleman from Florida talked about when he talked in terms of feet people. I have heard it suggested facetiously that the Government of Mexico would probably provide a bus service from the southern border to El Paso. Tex.. to expedite the transfer of these millions of persons through the nation of Mexico. so that they would have less of a tendency to stop somewhere along the line. because they would like to come here. And if we do not support them. in terms of economic support in their struggle against communism. this is the kind of economic impact that it could and could inevitably have on this Nation. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
980077714,"Mr. Chairman. the bill we have before us today is a mammoth package that does obligate the Federal Government to billions of dollars in commitments over the next several years. The International Monetary Fund authorization amounts to $8.4 billion in 1983. The Multilateral Development Banks authorization totals over $7 billion for capital subscriptions and contributions for an unlimited number of years. And finally. the ExportImport Bank authorizes direct loans and loan guarantees of nearly $15 billion in each of the next 2 years. But in the interests of an honest debate it should be remembered that this legislation represents only something in the order of $2 billion in out-. lays. As House Members know well. there has been keen interest among constituents in this bill. Many of the people in my district have told me. ""Lets get our own house in order before we send money overseas to take care of others."" I am sure I am not the only Member who has heard that suggestion. Debate on this bill will clearly. therefore. center on whether it is in our best interest to renew our commitments in these three areas. Because this is a trade bill. supporters of this measure must establish that our contributions to the IMF. the Multilateral Development Banks. and the Eximbank will be returned through greater U.S. exports which ultimately generate new jobs. economic growth. and tax revenues in our domestic economy. In any event. there will certainly be extended di.cussion about the perceived cost of this legislation. Well. whatever that cost is. let me give you a suggestion of how to reduce it by $1 billion. When we reach the amendment process later this week. I will offer an amendment to delete the new $1 billion program which I believe should more properly be considered in foreign aid legislation. not in a trade bill. Under title I. the ExportImport Bank would be authorized to spend up to $1 billion to match foreign aid offered by countries as a means for subsidizing their exports. This $1 billion would be available through a socalled competitive Tied Aid Fund at Eximbanks disposal. Very simply. mixed credits provide highly concessioned credit terms that essentially give away a large part of the benefit from exporting while benefiting the borrowers. Ironically. both the Eximbank itself and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. many of whose members are largely dependent on foreign trade. oppose the establishment of this fund. Their opposition makes good sense: First. foreign mixed credit financing is not a serious problem today. largely because of successful negotiations conducted by the administration to deter its use. Second. turning the Eximbank into a foreign aid agency is not likely to discourage offers of tied aid by countries abroad. On the contrary. the fund may well expand the use of tied aid and invite retaliation by our trade competitors. Finally. my amendment would delete the new fund. while leaving intact the Eximbanks present authority to offer tied aid financing when it deems necessary and which it can do under presently existing authority. I encourage Members who have heard complaints from their constituents about sending American tax dollars overseas to support this amendment when it is offerred."
980118628,Mr. Chairman. I rise In opposition to the amendment which would delay thle October 1 pay raise for Federal civilian employees to Janu1ary 1. 1984. We have been hearing arguments about how It Is only equitable that Government workers have a delay in their costofliving increases. We aie told that such a delay Is consistent with the delay in COLAs for retirees. There are. however. several factors wvhich should be considered before any action is taken to reduce or delay compensation and benefits for Government workers. For several years now. Government workers have received limited pay increases. have had substantial reductions in health benefits. and have been required to contribute to the medicare trust fund. To add insult to injury. these same employees will soon experience further reductions in their compensation and benefits. Last year. this Congress enacted a budget which contained a new compensation formula. This formula will result in a pay reduction beginning In January. Unfortunately. any pay increase is going to be offset by new reductions in the Federal employees health benefits program. While we do have legislation which would Increase the Governments contribution to the health benefits program. its uncertain how quickly we will be able to win congressional approval for that proposal. It has beer. reported that Increases In health Ir. surance premiums could average about 24 percent in January. A 3.5 or 4percent pay increase would be offset completely if this happens. The Presidents own pay advisers have reported that Federal pay lags behind the private sector by about 20 percent. Labor Department surveys show that the average pay increase for U.S. workers in 1983 were between 4.2 and 9.7 percent. with most raises rangIng in the 6.5- to 8.5percent range. After reductions are made in health benefits and the new pay formula is impiemnented. it will take much more than a 4percent pay increase to enable Government workers to just break even. I urge my colleagues to support adequate compensation for our Federal workers and vote against this amendnient.e
980160518,"Mr. Speaker. I would say to my colleagues here this evening that I have a certain sense of deja vu as we approach this subject at a fairly late hour this evening. Almost 30 years ago. I think if memory serves me correctly. almost to the month. I was a young law student in this city at that time. and I worked in the Senate as an employee. I ran a mimeograph machine for a while and then. as is the way in our Nation. I * managed to work myself up to the exalted position of Doorkeeper. I went to - law school for a while and I worked in the Senate for a while and we did all - those things. - My time was very precious to me at I that time. because law school was time f consuming and it was difficult. I would - go home at night and I would study. I - remember on one occasion. I think - 1954. perhaps 1955. we worked on sevMarc h. 1984 eral occasions throughout the night on the debates on the question of civil rights legislation. That was a time. I might add. In which there were giants in the U.S. Senate. Lyndon Johnson was a majority leader. and Everett Dirksen was the minority leader. There was an obscure Senator from a place called Massachusetta by the name of John Kennedy who had just come there. There was a guy by the name of Harry Byrd. Sr.. from Virginia. Dick Russell from Georgia. Joe McCarthy was at ill there. it was a time of giants in the Senate. As we slept over that night in the Halls of the Senate. I thought to myself. this has got to be important. and it is. and It was. of course. important. I am delighted to take part in this special order tonight and to devote our time this evening to what. I think. is an equally Issue. and to very frankly to try to call attention to the problem that we have of addressing this Issue in the Congress of the United States. Now. I ask you in all sincerity. Mr. Speaker. can you imagine Kate Smith singing that rousing patriotic song. ""To Whom It May Concern. Bless America."" Instead of ""God Bless America""? Should we undo what this Congress did in 1954 when. by act of Conidess. adopted by the Congress. the pledge of allegiance to the flag was amended to include the words. ""Under God."" It had not been so prior to that time. One Nation under God. indivisIble. and so forth. Every item of our currency contains the words. ""In God We Trust."" as does the language on the back of the podium of the Speaker. above the Speakers rostrum. It says in brass letters this high. ""In God We Trust."" It has been a fundamental principle of this Nation for the 200 years since our founding. Now. I suppose. Mr. Speaker. the Supreme Court in its wisdom. eventually will force us to reframe both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution because both of those documents mention God. We would have to rewrite them. because under the present view of the Supreme Court. no civics class in this Nation In any public school in this Nation would be allowed to read them in the public schools. These thoughts may. frankly. strike you as somewhat frivolous. but I assure you that they are not. For this is the position of the Court in rulings in the past 22 years and it has taken that position consistently with respect to the question of prayers in public schools. Since the Supreme Court first ruled that prayers In the public schools violated the first amendment. there have been literally hundreds of constitutional amendments proposed to overturn those decisions. While we In the Congress have been bickering. more and more Americans. as shown by public opinion polls. would like us to act. This is the first time that a President has asked the Congress to address this question. and I submit. Mr. Speaker. that the time has come for us to act by passing House Joint Resolution 100. of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. The amendment as has been stated several times before In this debate this afternoon and this evening. states simply. clearly and forever. ""Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public Institutions. No person shall be required by the United States. or by any State. to participate in prayer."" Very simple. straightforward framIng of the question. This is what the overwhelming majority of the citizens of this Nation believe is now meant by the Constitution. But the members of the Supreme Court. In the absence of any supernatural contact with our Founding Fathers. have seen fit to read their minds from afar and from 200 years perspective later. I respectfully suggest to you. Mr. Speaker. and to them. that those Justices have misread the signals. There Is evidence for this. A convincing piece of circumstantial evidence is that each session of the Constitutional Convention itself was opened with a prayer. It was no less an expert on the Constitution than a guy called Benjamin Franklin. who rose to ask his colleagues to begin each days work with prayer. Franklin said: I have lived. sir. a long time. And the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this fundamental truth: That God governs the affairs of men. I also believe that without his concurring aid. we shall succeed in this political building no better than the building of Babel. We shall be divided by our little. partial. local interests. Our projects will be confounded. and we ourselves shall become a reproach and a byword down to future ages. House Joint Resolution 100. as I have indicated before. of which I am a cosponsor. will. in my view. correct a Supreme Court error in mindreading and will remove the bar the Court now says exists to nodenominational. voluntary school prayer in public institutions. Just as important. it would make abundantly clear that neither the Federal nor the State Governments have the power to compel any child to pray. President Reagan. as I indicated. has endorsed this amendment. and so have millions of citizens who believe that peer pressure and drug problems in our schools make it more necessary than ever to permit children to pray if they wish to do so. Those millions of citizens will be heard when we pass House Joint Resolution 100. For approval of the Congress is but as we all know. the first step in this process. The school prayer amendment still will require the ratification of the legislatures of 38 States. threequarters of the 50 States in the Union. Let ns tell you. the citizens of every State will mount campaigns the likes of which we have never seen to win ratification of this amendment should they be permitted to do so. I believe wholeheartedly that this Is and probably is the only way to resolve this issue. Now I know that there are some who believe it would take too long. The States have 7 years to act on ratifloation once we pass this constitutional amendment. as it obviously true with every proposed constitutional amendment. It is the process required by the Constitution itself for an adoption of an amendment to that document. There are some who believe that we simply ought to tell the Supreme Court. we do not like your ruling on school prayer. we are going to pass a law that tqkes the power away from the Court to require the ratification process on an amendment. Mr. Speaker. I could not. and I cannot in good conscience. support any legislation that would gnaw away at the checks and balances of our Republic so carefully crafted by our forefathers. which have served us so well for over 200 years. We may not like. in fact. the way the Supreme Court sometimes interprets our intentions. But the solution quite rightly. lies in the arduous process of changing the Constitution. not in changing the rules. Instead. I believe that we must amend the Constitution so that the Supreme Court can no longer misread the intention of our Founding Fathers. The Court has decided that any prayer or period of meditation in the public schools is. in fact. advancing religion and advocating the establishment of religion. I quoted just a moment ago Benjamin Franklin on the subject. Let me now quote a fellow Virginian. Thomas Jefferson. who had quite a little to do with the drafting of the document in question here. This is from a letter that Jefferson wrote in 1802 to a group of Baptists in Danbury. Conn.. and Thomas Jefferson said: Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God. that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship. that the legislative powers of government reach actions only. and not opinion. I contemplate with solemn reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. thus building a wall of separation between church and state. Let me repeat those last few words: thus building a wall of separation between church and state. Those are Jeffersons words in his letter pf 1802. They are not part of the first amendment to the Federal Constitution. It is. of course. the language I "" Mom& & UPON CO cited so often by people who oppose school aret. It has been Used so very o tht this phrae. ""the separaton of church ad state."" that may people think l Is a part and parel of the first smeadment or tn some other way embodied In the Constitution. It is not. The first amendment Is the only place in the entire document that refers to religion. save for the section in article VI that states. ""No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust under the United States."" Those are the exclusive two places where religion is referred to. There is convincing evidence that Jefferson himself did not believe in an Inviolable separation except so far as recognition or prejudice for or against a particular religion was concerned. When Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. he recommended that sectarian schoolssectarian schoolsbe established on the campus of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville so that the students attending those sectarian schools %ould take advantage of the courses at the University of Virginia. I would submit that this hardly casts Jefferson in the role of an advocate of an absolute wall of separation. It is simply inconsistent. Yet. today the Supreme Court would hold that Jeffersons sugestion is in fact unconstitutional. from the gentleman who probably had so much to do with framing the Constitution as any other person in the history of this Nation. I submit to you. and I humbly suggest. Mr. Speaker. that Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin knew more about their intentions and those of their colleagues who formed that Constitution than the various members of the Supreme Court over the last few decades who have seen fit to Interpret them. As I view it.. Mr. Speaker. this issue is one of liberty. The very heart and soul of this Nation Is its belief in Individual liberty. Each and every citizen of this Nation. every one of us. has the right. only limited by laws that protect the rights of others. to worship as we see fit. or not to worship at all. Each of us has the right to believe in God. Jehovah. Mohammed. Buddha. or any other prophet or deity as we individually determine and as we see fit. but none of us has the right to tell anyone else who to worship or when. where and how to worship. so long as he or she does not trample on our rights. That is the fundamental basis of this Nation. Right now in Virginia and in a score of other States. children in the public schools have the rightyes. Mr. Speaker. the rightto pray to whomever they wish silently during a moment of meditation. Virginia and the several States enacted State laws giving the children this right because the Supreme Court has barred prayers. It me shae with Ao. Mr. peaker. erp anl w the tas"" that in an oe of Bassi v. Stih. S7 l.8. a3. In t. and 44seu. sohot DwAtkot v. *hesiA 394 UA. 808. In 10. the two prinolpal leal precedents for this pltion. ths Suprene Court held unoon. satitional State sponsorship of prayer and bible reading exerises IN the publie schools. but that Is a agaIieantly different Iese than Us one beiag addressed here tonight In terms of a maossent of meditation in a public institution. At the time those two decisions were rendered. bible reading was reqired by State law in 12 States plus the District of Columbia. and was expressly permitted by an additional 17 States. while prayer was required by one State plus the District of Columbia. and was permitted under State law in an additional 1 States. 9 States prohibited both practices. Twelve States had no provisions regarding bible reading. while 23 States had no provisions requiring prayer. Currently. or at least as of 1988. the last information that I have available to me. at least eight States appear to have retained or to have adopted. subsequent to the Engel and Abingdon declsiong. statutes as yet unchallenged permitting school prayer and/or bible reading. while 19 States have provisions permitting or requiring moments for silent meditation."
980160532,"I thank the gentleman for his contribution. Mr. Speaker. as I was Indicating. Virginia and a number of other States have enacted State laws giving children this right to a moment of meditation because the Supreme Court has barred prayers in public schools. There is no teachermonitor checking to see that each chili doe Indeed pray. for it is a right. obviously. to be exercised or not as the individual student wishes. And as has been pointed out earlier in this debate. even were there a. teacher monitor or some effort in some way to determine what is happening ift this moment of meditation. how coulh you possibly do that? How could you read the minds of 25 or 50 or 50.000 students in front of you to determine whether they were worried about this afternoons football prac. tice or were in fact praying? That is the purpose of all this. to permit thAl. person. he or she. to do whatever khey see fit to do at that moment t.i voluntary involvement. That is tNi whole idea here. There is no teacher monitor. This is presumably constitutionally permitted. says the Court. so long as it serves completely secular ends. Virgird calls it a period of meditation or silence. and its aim is to foster harmony. But no one. not even the Supreme Court. is privy to what a child thinks during a period of silence. and even if one child in a group of 30 wants to pray while the rest daydream. that one child should not be denied the opportunity to do so. By the same reasoning. if any of the children do not wish to pray. then no one should force them. That is the purpose of all this. This Nation. Mr. Speaker. has made great strides against discrimination. but there are yet great strides to be made. It sometimes appears that in our seal to reach equity we overstep ourselves and we create. and we have created. a tyranny of the minority. This occurs when a very small minority. perhaps even in some instances a single individual. complains about a practice of the great majority. The small minority waives the red banner of discrimination to curtail the rights of others. all under the guise that practice of the many discriminates against the rights of the few. Under this reasoning. Mr. Speaker. if anyone objects to God or to religion. the Supreme Court. to remain consistent. would have to rule that all the U.S. currency and coins be redalled. desiroyed and new currency printed and minted so that the word. ""God."" would Ie excised. To do otherwie would be totally inconsistent on the part of the Court. I presume. as stated earlier. that we would have to reframe in some way our Declaration of Independence. Copies are in most. if not all. of our schools. and it contains the word. ""God."" What do we do about that? The State legislatures and the Congress itself would have to abandon the practice of opening sessions with prayers. and I submit. with all respect. Mr. Speaker. that if anyone in this Nation needs prayers. we do. These are ridiculous steps. and by any logic we should not even be here tonight discussing this issue. It should not be an issue. It should never have come up. Thils country was colonized by many groups who came to the New World to escape religious intolerance. To now. once again. more than 300 years later. give into this very same intolerance is basically wrong. And while we are going about the resolution of this problem. Mr. Speaker. let us remember the lesson we should be learning. From now on. when we amend our Constitution or enact legislation. let us declare loudly and clearly. in language that even the Supreme Court can understand. what are our intentions. To give an example of legislative intent. let me recall with the Members. Mr. Speaker. the last time my State. the Commonwealth of Virginia. rewrote its constitution. That was in the session in 1969 and 1970. I was a member of the House of Delegates of Virginia at that time. We labored long and hard over the language that we were putting into that Constitution. We did so for a number of reasons. not just because of the traditions of that very historic place. the Commonwealth of Virginia. but we did so because those of us who had had the opportunity of becoming involved in the legal processes in our State had seen various judges of the Virginia Supreme Court interpret Virginias statutes in a manner that the general assembly in our view never intended. We wanted to make sure. as sure as possible. that when the constitutional revision was completed. it would stand as a clear and concise document. with no ambiguities that could be seized upon to bend the laws of the Commonwealth. It is. I am sure. the same principle that guided George Mason and Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin in those difficult times in the constitutional sessions in Philadelphia. Precision Is critical in the crafting of a constitutional document. because. as we all have seen so often. results can hinge in the real world on an interpretation of one word. and that Is an awesome responsibility. Does the gentleman from Texas desire me to yield?"
980160542,I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for those extremely kind words. I want to express to the gentleman that I certainly have the traditional and adequate respect for Justice Frankfurter. I did not always agree with his decisions on the Court. but I thank the gentleman for his contribution and his observations. I would further express my appreciation to him for not mentioning Thaddeus Stevens in his comment. Although he is a well known biographical scholar on the life of Mr. Stevens. when he backed into that reference in a discussion with the gentleman from North Carolina. can you imagine what would happen if we engaged in a colloquy on Mr. Stevens with the gentleman from Virginia? That would be beyond the pale. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania. I do appreciate his comments. Mr. Speaker. let me just complete my observations on this matter in the several moments that I have left by suggesting to my colleagues that. as we so well all recognize and appreciate. this is the greatest experiment in human history for individual political and religious and economic freedom. This is the greatest participatory democracy that the creative minds of man have ever determined for any society. This is the worlds greatest nation. The thing that makes it so great is that we have the individual freedom to do our individual thing. MuchP 5. 1984 whether it is in fact economic. political. religious. whatever. That is the genius of America. This right to engage in nondenominational voluntary observation of your individual political orientation in a publia place without coercion is In fact a fundamental part of that individual freedom. That is. i fact. what this debate is all about. There are Members of this House who in their trustration have seen fit to frankly join together in a kind of a conspiracy. if you will. to attempt to point out to the leadership of this House that it is intolerable that this issue cannot be addressed by the maJority of the Members of this House because the leadership will not in fact permit this question to be given to us. That condition can no longer be permitted to prevail. If in fact it comes here and the House works its will and there are not twothirds of the Members who are willing to support it. then so be it. because that is the American consitutional provision and the American way. but It. on the other handad I respectfully submit to you. Mr. Speaker. that it wouldif twothirds of the Members of this House said that we should let the Individual States consider the ratification of this amendment. then the leadership of this House is wrong in not per* mitting that issue to at least be considered in an up or down vote. I would hope. Mr. Speaker. that at an early time in the legislative schedule. which has not been terribly full of important considerations since the beginning of this session of Congress. at a timely period in the near future. the leadership of this House would see fit to motivate the majority of the Judiciary Committee to report to us a constitutional amendment that would permit the consideration of a moment of meditation in a public institution in this Nation. If they do so. Mr. Speaker. it cannot be any time too soon. II 117 I am just as confident as I am stan* Ins here that it in fact we are givea that right. that opportunity. to take a position on that issue. it will prevail. As I have indicated earlier in my re. marks. Mr. Speaker. there Is no ques tion that there would be a program of ratification that would rise up in the chests of the people of this Nation who so strongly support this Issue. and it would in fact be ratified at an early time by the States. That i the pur pose of thi constitutional provisions that provide for that process. Why this House and the leadership thereof will not let the House work its will is beyond my comprehension. I would hope. Mr. Speaker. that whoever Is charged with the responsibility on that side of making that determination would in fact determine that we should address this issue in an early timeframe. With that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time. NOTICE Inecomplete record of House proceedings. Except for concluding business which follows. todays House proceedings will be continued in the next issue of the Record.
980190588,"Mr. Chairman. the serious situation now facing the United States in Central America is composed of two elementspoverty and injustice on one hand. and national security interests on the otherwhich are so interrelated that neither can be dealt with alone. Countries in the region have a long history of poverty .and social injustice on a scale few Americans can imagine. The majority of the population is barely at the subsistance level. and has no reason to feel any particular loyalty to the existing social or political order. Our involvement must take this central fact into account. or there will be no chance of accomplishing anything. We must structure our aid programs to insure that the people benefit. and we must continue to insist that the governments there make progress on insuring basic legal rights for their people. We must also keep in mind that we are not going to see the immediate creation of Americanstyle democracles in the area. The transition will be slow. particularly if it continues to be hindered by violence. This situation is ripe for exploitation by revolutionaries directed from Cuba and Nicaragua. This is one area where we should have no illusions. The fact that the people have legitimate grievances against their governments does not mean that those who are fighting the governments automatically assume a similar legitimacy. There has long been an unfortunate tendency by wellmeaning Americans to assume that anyone fighting unjust situations is. ipso facto. an ""agrarian reformer"" or prodemocracy. We have heard this about Mao Tsetung. Ho Chi Minh. and Fidel Castro. and we are now hearing it about the leaders of Nicaragua and the rebels in El Salvador. It is no more true there than it was in China. Vietnam. or Cuba. Whatever the motivation of some of their supporters. the leaders of the guerrilla forces are dedicated to the establishment of totalitarian states owing allegiance to Havana and Moscow. The debate today. as rarely in recent history. clearly illuminates the divergent paths we have before us in Central America. We can accept title X of the foreign aid bill as written. thus bringing an effective halt to all milltary assistance to El Salvador. This in all likelihood would achieve the immediate goals of its supportersstopping the fighting. However. it would stop not because our aid is the sole cause of the conflict. as some here seem to think. but rather because the Nicaraguans and Cubans would increase theirs. guaranteeing a Communist victory. There would be peace in El Salvadorthe peace of slavery. Of course. we would then be here again in a year or so going through the same debate with respect to Costa Rica. Guatemala. Panama. and Honduras. And perhaps. juht perhaps. Mexico. This would pose a direct threat to the national security of the United States. Although none of these countries. by themselves. is in any way dangerous. one or more of them acting as bases for the Soviet Union and as instigators and suppliers of guerrilla warfare in neighboring countries is another matter entirely. We must remember that Mexico. ats well as the smaller countries. has extensive poverty. corruption. and abuses of power. The strategic implications of Soviet bases on or near our borders. to say nothing of the refugee situation that would result from Communist conquest of the area. are staggering. Or we can support the Broomfield amendment. providing most of the assistance the President has requested. and give the people of El Salvador the chance they wantas so overwhelmingly demonstrated in Sundays electionto continue to develop democratic institutions and to defend themMay 10. 1984 COIN selves against a Communist dictatorship they clearly do not want. I have been to El Salvador. and I have spoken with people from all walks of lifeGovernment officials. soldiers. peasants. and refugees. All seek only a chance to provide a decent life for themselves and their country. free of terror from left and right. This cannot happen in a vaccum. We must continue to provide assistance of both a military and economic nature to assist the people of El Salvador develop their fledgling democracy. This is what President Reagan seeks to accomplish. and I support the basic elements of his policy for Central America. We must provide reasonable amounts of economic and military assistance to the people and friendly governments there. because it is clearly in our interest to do so. Failure to act. and adopt the Broomfield amendment. will carry..grave. and highly expensive. consequences."
980228849,I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Speaker. I have requested this time to address the issue of an amendment that I have proposed which would normally be considered at the time of the adoption of the bill. I take this time during the discussion of the rule to explain the status of that matter. There has been considerable concern. Mr. Speaker. in regard to the one House veto under the recent Supreme Court Chadha decision. That situation is still in a state of uncertainty. There are some in the administration and some in the House who have suggested that. inasmuch as there has been previously a strong suggestion that the District of Columbia terminate its right to go to the U.S. Treasury for capital loans. that we take that action this year. during 1984. and that I. therefore. should consider offering an amendment that would prohibit the District of Columbia from borrowing up to $155 million from the Federal Treasury for capital outlays. as is authorized under this bill. There is obviously always the possibilUty that if I do not offer this amendment. one of my colleagues could or would be prepared to do so. After some sober reflection. however. Mr. Chairman. I have considered that the adoption of such an amendment at this time would place the District of Columbia in a very difficult financial situation and could seriously adversely affect or jeopardize the construction schedule of Washingtons subwaysystem. The City Administrator for the District of Columbia has informed me that if the District is denied this loan authority. as contained within this bill. it might not and probably would not. be able to meet its financial obligations for metro construction. That would mean that Maryland and Virginia would have to provide the shortfall in order to keep metro construetion on schedule. The entire Washington metro area has made significant progress In completing the full 101mile system and this amendment could threaten that effort. I. therefore. will not offer my amendment on this appropriation bill and would hope that no other Member will pursue an amendment similar in thrust at this time.

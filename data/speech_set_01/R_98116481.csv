980005095,"Mr. President. Dave Kindred of the Washington Post has stated it well: ""What the Olympics needs is not fewer Bob Knights but more."" Bob Knight is a great coach and teacher. He is also a loyal friend. I would like to share Dave Kindreds column of February 17. 1983. in the Washington Post with my colleagues. I ask that the column be printed In the RECORD. The column follows: LErs Go WIrr Ova BEST: KNIGHT (By Dave Kindred) This Bob KnighthatesPuerto Rico stuff has taken on a life of ils own. with only the most deceiving relationship to truth. Because of it. some people say Knight shouldnt be the U.S. Olympic basketball coach in 1984. It is time someone rose up on his hind legs and shouted. ""The guy was railroaded. Get off his case."" Cover your ears. dear readers. because there will be more shouting here today. some from your mildmannered typist and some from Knight. who yesterday said. ""Im tired of this. If we lose tonight because Ive spent so much time on this Puerto Rico thing this week. Im going to be sicker than Ive been in a long time."" Knights Indiana University team would play Iowa shortly after he talked by phone about the latest storm thundering around his ears. (Indiana did lose. 5857). Or maybe the lightning is dancing on the back pockets of his jeans. for it was a report of his moonoverSan Juan joke that breathed life into what seemed a dead issue. Three years ago at the Paf American Games. Knight was arrested and convicted in absentia of a misdemeanorassaulting a police officer. Should he return to Puerto Rico. he faces a $500 fine and six months in jail. As any redblooded American would do. Knight crossed Puerto Rico off his list of vacation sites. And why not? Every member of the U.S. basketball delegation testified that Knight only pushed away a cop who had put his finger in the coachs eye. All agreed the cop provoked the incident. None denies Knights anger. Knight had lifted his voice to reason with the fingerpointing policeman. who in turn lifted his handcuffs. This was early in the Games. shortly after some Puerto Ricans cut down eight U.S. flags and burned two by way of saying have a happy day. This was in a place where antiU.S. sentiment ran so hot that Knight remembers. ""At the CubaU.S. womens basketball game. everybody cheered for Cuba."" Two days later in a CubaU.S. mens game. a Cuban suckerpunched Kyle Macy. the Kentucky allAmerican. Macys jaw was broken. Back home in Indiana. Knight asked Gov. Otis Bowen if he should write a letter of apology to Puerto Rico Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo. ""Gov. Bowen said no."" Knight said. ""But I wrote It. anyway."" Knights letter said his problem was with one man. not the warm and dignified people of Puerto Rico. ""I offer my most sincere apologies through you to them if anything I have done or said has been interpreted as being offensive to the people of Puerto Rico."" the letter said. Knight said Gov. Romero Barcelo never answered the letter. ""Im done. as of now. talking about Puerto Rico."" the coach said. ""I did nothing wrong. I apologized if anybody thought I did. I dont think I need to say another thing. Its ridiculous. Ive never directed any remarks at any group. religious or ethnic. This unAmerican crapIm as American as anybody can be."" Back in 1979. masters of ceremonies started giving Knight oneway plane tickets to San Juan. At a hospital benefit dinner last fall. Knight said no thanks to the joke/ticket. He also said he dropped his drawers and mooned Puerto Rico as his plane left. ""Thats the last thing I wanted those people to see of me."" Knight said. and everyone laughed. as people have laughed for three years now. ""People have done that to me 500 times."" Knight said. ""Major league baseball players. Puerto Ricans. have kidded me about it. Chi Chi Rodriguez needled me in front of 200 people. and I thought it was funnier than hell and so did he. and we hugged and that was it. The governor of Indiana. President Ford and U.S. senators have needled me. It was always done in fun. and. Ive given as well as I took. Don Rickles gets paid big money for saying the same things."" Difference is. Rickles wont represent the U.S. in the Olympics. a politically sensitive arena where diplomacy and tact not the kindest of insults. should cover every situation. Knights mooning joke is ""incredibly tasteless."" to quote an editorial in The Washington Post that called for Knights replacement as the Olympic coach. Soon. Puerto Rico politicians raised a clamor for Knights dismissal. as did the Hispanic caucus in the U.S. Congress. These critics see Knight as a crude. racist bully who misrepresents the Olympic ideal of sportsmanship. brotherhood and fair play. Bullfeathers. Loudly. Knight is a great coach whose honesty does honor to his university. We can pick nits with lapses in judgment (whereas editorialists and columnists are without flaw). But for every little debit. there are a dozen large credits. What the Olympics needs is not fewer Bob Knights. but more. Our last two Olympic coaches back Knight. ""Bob is a man of integrity and great intelligence."" Dean Smith said. ""Im not at all worried. He will represent the U.S. very well."" Dave Gavitt said. ""Im very comfortable with Bob. The events of Puerto Rico will have nothing to do with these Olympics. He will be coaching the U.S. In Los Angeles."" One thing more. The San Juan Stars editorial pages of Jan. 27 carried a lawyers article entitled ""The issue of corruption."" Juan M. Garcia Passalacqua said corruption in Puerto Rican government is ""without precedent."" The lawyer detailed corruption charges touching the governments banking. housing. public works. drugs. electricity and financial departments. ""The Police Department is under investigation by a federal grand jury for corruption and Mafia connections in high places."" he wrote. Bob Knight said. ""It sounds like they have a few things more pertinent to do than mess around with a basketball coach."" He said it loudly.e"
980009451,Mr. President. I shall take a moment of the leadership time this morning to say that the United States of America may now be able to proceed with greater confidence in the success of arms reduction talks on the basis of yesterdays West German elections. These were watched in this country and around the world with very great interest. I am certain that all Members who visited with Chancellor Helmut Kohl during his visit to this country and his visit with many Members of this body a short time ago wish to congratulate him. and. as well. the members of the coalition of Free Democrats who will join with the Christian Democrats to provide continuity in the Government of West Germany. Clearly. it was an election victory achieved not only in the midst of worldwide scrutiny but also with very substantial participation by many outside forces. However. many observers of the West German election pointed out that economic circumstances within West Germany might be the most important factor to watch. Indeed. the report of 10.4 percent unemployment just before the election gave pause to many who were concerned about the continuity of the Helmut Kohl government. It is constructive to point out that the government of Helmut Kohl has offered leadership policies which. I hope. will work cooperatively with our own toward a restoration of economic strength in the West. For many reasons I am certain this administration welcomes that partnership: It is clear. further. that our Government must proceed with the mandate that this election has given to us for cooperation with all parties in Germany which look both toward the negotiation of an arms reduction agreement and to the possibilities of strength that come through the certainty of continuity in albeit purposes. Further Mr. President. I would note that frequently this body is given indications that our foreign policy has some problems. These we freely admit and we try to make corrections. However. today it is instructive to point out that the new Soviet leader. Mr. Andropov. has apparently struck out twice in a row: First. in the strong remarks he made to the Government of Japan in an attempt to influence. if not intimidate. the new Prime Minister there. and now in his strong intervention in the West German election. On both counts he has failed. In fact. our alliance with Japan and our alliance with West Germany stand stronger at this particular point. I think this is a matter on which we should congratulate the President of the United States. our Secretary of State. and those who foster these foreign policies.
980018628,Mr. President. last September. Deputy Secretary of State Walter J. Stoessel. Jr.. testified thatIt is perhaps obvious to all that the collection of peoples and societies that calls Itself the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is different from the United States. It is the degree and nature of that difference which is hard to absorb . . . It takes hard research and analytical work over a long period. and firsthand experience in the Soviet Union. to wrench us out of our own cultural assumptions into theirs. to appreciate the differences between their society and ours. I recalled this statement while viewIng the television coverage of Leonid Brezhnevs funeral. Power was being transferred to a new leader of our major adversary and we did not even know for sure whether that new leader speaks English. We know a great deal about the U.S.S.R. For example. we now know more than ever before about such topics as demographic processes in the Soviet Union and the administration of Soviet science. Yet. the gaps in our knowledge remain enormous. A talented generation of government and academic specialists will soon retire. Indeed. according to one estimate. nearly half of the recognized academic experts currently working on Soviet affairs will be dead or retired by the end of this decade. In fact. by 1980. more American college students were studying Latin than Russian. If current trends continue unabated. we will lose our national capacity to analyze the actions of our primary international competitor. The recent transfer of power from Brezhnev to Andropov magnifies the need to increasenot decreaseour expertise on the Soviet Union and East Europe. Andropov has already indicated that he will move in ways beyond those of his predecessor. We must know more about where he is taking the Soviet Union than we do now If we are to formulate effective policy responses to the U..SR. It Is for this reason that I have advocated the SovietBloc Research and Training Act of 1983. The SovietBloc Research and Training Act of 1983 would establish a $50 million endowment to be invested and reinvested by the U.S. Treasury. The interest from that investment would be used to support a national program of advanced research for broad dissemination to the public and to Government policymakers and the training of research specialists under university auspices as well as support for their studies in East European countries and the Soviet Union. The interest from the fund would be used to support the ongoing activities of the National Council for Soviet and East European Research. the International Research and Exchanges Board. and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars as well as to create new programs to help universities and other institutions around the country support their own research in Soviet and East European studies. How would this new endowment help ease the developing manpower shortage in government and East European studies programs? First. it formulates a mechanism by which a flexible. comprehensive integrated research and manpower training program can develop. The bill does not create a new bureaucracy. Instead. it maximizes the results to be achieved from a relatively modest. onetime appropriation by utilizing previously existing institutional structure. Second. this legislation recognizes that traditional sources of support for Soviet studiesnamely the universities and foundationsare hardpressed to meet numerous other demands which are more closely connected to their main institutional missions. The Federal Government remains the most direct beneficiary of trained personnel in Soviet and East European studies and the Government remains the ultimate enduser of research in that area. Therefore. the Government must accept more responsibility for maintenarce of this field than would be necessary in mnut other fields of research. Finally. this bill is quite modest in scope and will not generate a flood of new specialists who cannot find appropriate job placement. Rather. it begins with the recognition that it requires 10 to 15 years to train a highly qualified expert in Soviet and East European affairs. That educatidnal process includes language training. several years of graduate work. and finally. practical experience through travel. research. and writing. This bill is designed to support a limited number of highly talented students as they move through the long training process. As new leadership takes hold of the Soviet Union. we need the best minds and talents the Nation can offer to participate in the effort to understand our primary global adversary. The Soviets denote substantial efforts to understand us. While our Soviet affairs community has withered. the Soviet community of Americanists and internationalists has expanded at a record rate. This is one area in which we can no longer afford to be second best. The SovietBloc Research and Training Act of 1983 will help assure a steady flow of new talent in the coming years to respond to whatever course of action the Soviet leadership may take.e
980046009,"Mr. President. the bill which Senator LAXALT and I are introducing today would enhance the role of the national political parties in the campaign process. and would strengthen the political process by allowing more. not less. participation. Our bill would remove unjustified limitations on national party expenditures and in so doing would achieve campaign reform in a manner consistent with our heritage of voluntary participation. In my view. this approach is preferable to further limiting the civic participation of Americans acting through political action committees. Such restrictive proposals. I believe. proceed from fundamentally antidemocratic premises which are fully as political as the activities they would restrict. The fact isand we should keep this in mind as we debate the role of PACsall money contributed through PACs and party committees ultimately comes from individuals. PACs are now providing a channel of public expression for millions of Americans who voluntarily give money for causes or candidates in which they believe. Let us be absolutely clear about what is at stake here: It is citizens. not faceless corporations or interest groups. whose rights we are discussing. and whose political activities would be curtailed by further restrictions. I have had direct experience with this in my own campaign of 1982. A number of the PAC groups who contributed to my campaign were those contributions at warehouse luncheons at various factories in my State. I remember on one occasion meeting for a potluck lunch on a hot summer day. The workers brought homemade pies and covered dishes. After eating together on paper plates. we held a town meeting and talked about a wide range of issues. Many of these workers who made up this PAC had never before actively participated in our political process. but they did that day and again in November on election day. I challenge anyone to call them fat cats. The chief attack on PACs centers on the claim that PACs unduly ""influence"" legislators. To be blunt about it. I have simply seen no credible assertion that any specific candidates have become captive to PACs. Let us consider a few facts. Total PAC contributions to the average 1982 Republican Senate campaign came to only 17 percent of all of the campaigns receipts. And that is the total for all PACs of all kinds including groups which frequently oppose one another. Our colleague. Senator DAVID DunENBERGER of Minnesota. has pointed out that the average PAC contribution to his campaign amounted to three onehundredths of 1 percent -of his overall campaign receipts. The largest contribution allowable under current law amounted to just twotenths of 1 percent. Some ""Influence."" If a $5.000 limit was reasonable when Congress set the current standard in 1974. then inflation has made it two or three times relatively safer now. A 1982 survey of business PACs revealed that fewer than onethird have any representation in Washington. The danger of being influenced by a lobbyist who does not exist Is difficult to discern. Beyond this. It is well known to most people familiar with the PAC process that funding decisions are arrived at through many letters. calls and meetings and in some cases even opinion surveys involving the PACs membership. Often. PAC decisions are arrived at far more democratically than are the decisions of those groups which attack them. Those who wish to silence these groups in order to have the field of public opinion to themselves have understandable motives. but the Constitution does not confer on them the right to achieve their ends. The fact is that the Political Action Committee movement Is a reform movement itself. It is a straightforward way in which many individuals make small contributions and work in concert to achieve ends in which they believe. It is the antithesis of backroom politics. and in my judgment PACs have brought new vitality to the American political process. The courts have already ruled in several areas of campaign finance. They have indicated in major decisions that Americans have the right to become active in political campaigns. and that spending ones own money is an inherent part of that right. a part which ought to be abridged only when a very great burden of evidence demands it. No such burden exists in this case. We have gradually evolved in the direction of campaign financing based on this fundamental premise: voluntary support with full disclosure. This is the principle which ought to guide our deliberations on campaign reform. this is the principle which I believe is most consistent with our heritage. We should not be in the business of compelling citizens to contribute through the Internal Revenue System to candidates with whom they may or may not agree. We should not be in the business of establishing further complicated formulas for how much is the ""right"" of ""Just"" amount to spend on elections. The American people are perfectly competent to decide that for themselves. The public interest is seved by more. not less. freedom. Freedom in the political process means the right and the ability to assemble and to pursue shared objectives with likeminded people. The broadest and least ""special"" of all such political associations are our two national political parties. If the fraction of campaign funds contributed by PACs is troublesome to some. then the antidote most consistent with our free heritage is to eliminate unreasonable limits on our political parties and dilute PAC dollars still further through more competition. For example. the National Republican Senatorial Committee has served as a conduit for greater citizen action in the political process. During the past election cycle. the committee received 1.4 million individual contributions. averaging $34.29 each. The bill which Senator LAXALT and I are introducing today would help restore to the political parties a measure of importance which they have lost in recent years. There are undoubtedly many reasons for the relative decline of political parties in recent years. and I for one do not believe that PACs are solely. or even largely responsible for this phenomenon. But it is fair to say that many changes which have been made in Federal campaign laws In the last decade or so have weakened the position of the political parties. Specifically. our bill would permit the national committees of political parties to provide an unlimited supply of campaign materials to candidates. It would also allow national committees to provide unlimited assistance to candidates for registration and getoutthevote drives. These changes would extend to the national party organizations the same freedom to assist candidates that the 1979 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act extended to State parties. The .1979 changes were a welcome. development. and I believe that we ought to extend this reform further yet. Our bill would also permit the national parties to provide unlimited assistance to Senate and House candidates. Under current law. the respective Senate and House campaign committees may offer only limited assistance to candidates. For example. the Senatorial Committees may now contribute no more than $17.500 directly to any candidate. Our bill would raise this limit to $30.000. More significantly. the committees are currently limited as to how much they can spend in coordination with any particular candidate. The combined expenditures of the party committees for a Senate candidate. for example. may not exceed about $78.000 in States like Maine. South Dakota. and Wyoming in 1984. Given the enormous cost of modern campaigning. this is a very small amount of assistance indeed. These limits should be lifted in their entirety. The parties should be able to spend without arbitrary restrictions all funds which they can raise on behalf of their candidates. Party money tends to come In relatively small contributions from a great many individuals. It is the antithesis of special interests. Those who are concerned about the makeup of PAC contributionsand I am clearly not one of themought to find these party contributions wholly acceptable.e By Mr. HEINZ:"

Yet. since that time. various Presidents have appointed special representatives to the Vatican. We have continuously had a representative there since President Nixon was In office. Last week Nepal was the 107th country to officially estabish diplomatic relations with the Holy See. In fact. the United States Is one of the few countries not to recognize the Vatican as a sovereign state and the Pope as the chief of state. On a practical level. such a recognition would be in the best interests of this country. It would improve the exchange of information and establish more formal and effective channels of communication. But. there is a more Important reason for our establishing formal diplomatic ties with the Vatican. Under the courageous leadership of Pope John Paul II. the Vatican State has assumed its rightful place in the world as an international voice. It Is only right that this country show its respect for the Vatican by diplomatically recognizing It as world state. Under the guidance of Pope John Paul II. the Vatican has come to have tremendous political and moral influence in this world of ours. This was most recently illustrated by the Popes successful intervention with Polish leaders on behalf of the people of his native land. The United States should remove itself from the list of remaining nations yet to grant the Vatican full diplomatic recognition. There is no question but that this Is the right thing to do. And In conclusion. I want to commend my fellow Hoosier Senator for taking the lead on this important issue.
980106424,Mr. President. I recently had the opportunity to meet with a delegation of distinguished European parliamentarians visiting this country to explain their countries support of a strong Western defense. including the proposed deployment of the Pershing II and cruise missiles. beginning this December. These European leaders. all of whom have extensive experience In national defense and security affairs. emphiasized that they hoped the Geneva negotiation for a satisfactory arms control agreement would be successful but were equally firm in their support of deployment of the Euromissiles if negotiations should fail. The members of the European Delegation on International Defense were: Peter Petersen. CDU member of the Bundestag. Federal Republic of Germany. arid chairman of the delegation. Monique GarnierLancon. a deputy mayor of Paris and vice chairman of the European Institute for Security Matters. vicechairman of the delegation. Edward leigh. Conservative Member of Parliament. Great Britain. Senator Robert Close. Liberal Member of the Belgian Senate. Carlo Ripa de Meana. Socialist Member of the European Parliament from Italy. and J. L. Janssen Van Raay. Christian Democrat Member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands. They constituted a unique group. including representatives of the major nonCommunist political parties of Western Europe. including Christian Democrat. Socialist. Liberal. and Conservative. And they represented the five countries where the Pershing II and cruise missiles will be deployed. plus FraIhce. which. with its Independent nuclear force. supports deployment of these INF weapons. The parliamentarians were particularly eager to inform the American people that the great majority of the European people support deployment as demonstrated in recent national elections in which political parties favoring deployment. unless there are successful Geneva talks. won decisive victories in Great Britain. Germany. Italy and the Netherlands. Mr. President. I wish to extend my congratulations to the Center for International Relations and its president. Lee Edwards. for organizing this important and timely visit. And I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD excerpted remarks by members of the delegation. The remarks follow:
980109100,"Mr. President. I rise to support the MoynihanHatch amendment. I do so after a careful reflection of the alternatives. The chairman of the Agriculture Committee. the distinguished Senator from North Carolina. has presented quite accuragely the fact that this legislation Is fragile. As all of us know from the colloquies yesterday. It arises In this form because of disagreements among the Members of this body on whether we ought to be discussing a program that the Secretary of Agriculture Aid others feel was Imperative for this body to consider. Just to review the bidding. the Sec. retary pointed out that the target prices for corn. and wheat. cotton. and rice are likely to lead to even higher expenditures by the Federal Government In the years to come. There is certainly a disagreement In this body as to whether we ought to discuss that Issue or let the 4year farm bill run its course and simply hope that circumstancesthe weather or the markets or exportsmight be of assistance to us. That Is not a very good hope. Many Members have already pointed out in these past few days that however one calculates the agriculture bill it appears to have amounted to over $20 billion. some say $22 billion and others as much as $25 billion. And this is a very sizable sum of money which has been avoided. As a matter of fact. difficult decisions have been avoided to a point that the legislation Is truncated now to simply a discussion of dairy and tobacco. Many Members of this body prefer to simply let the clock run on. And this Is at the very time that the consuming part of our rhetoric Is about the deficit and about interest rates and about general fiscal policy. It is impossible to miss $20 billion to $25 billion and to take a look at what is suggested as a compromise amendment or now a compromise bill as somehow having general endorsement of this body. I think the point is the compromise has been made among Senators who have dairy interests. Only these persons were Involved In the cojmpromise. I hope that the rest of the Senate that has a general interest in the budget. a general interest in fiscal policy of this Country.. is listening to this debate. bepause we are talking about a sizable sum of money and it all boils down now to a very fragile bill. a very small Issue. Now. having said that. the choice is a clear one. Those who have wrestled with the dairy problem. principally Senators with dairy Interests thatare substantial. have tried to fashion a compromise that includes the payment. now described by the S9ecretary of Agriculture as despicable. the 50cent payment. that is retained. and hopefully it is used in part to fund a payment in cashnot payment in kind. but payment in cashto the dairy farmers not to produce more milk and butter. It Is a national scandal presently that we review frequently in all of our rhetoric about national programs. that caves in the United States are filling up with butter and cheese. and that we have no idea how we would consume 8 to 10 percent more production than we have any hope of consuming every year. The compromise suggested by the committee and the part of the bill we are trying to amend here clearly aggravates that situation. The dairy farmers are going to find avenues out of this dilemma. and there are several. Each of us who has dairy farmers have discussed this legisiation. Dairy farmers will point out how you change the feed ratio. how you cull out particular animals. how you. in essence. keep in the game so that when the game changes you go back to production as it was. And that Is perfectly rational. to maximize profits. Anyone feeling that this is going to lead to much of a change I think is In error. The Secretarty .. - Agriculture finally found the whole thing so marginal that he said unless you have some caps on target prices. you ought not to proceed with this dairy business at all. The whole dairy compromise is marginal. in terms of national policy. The distinguished Senator from New York and the distinguished Senator from Utah have come forward with at least a breath of fresh air in this debate. They have offered a perfectly straightforward. simple amendment which says under the market system in this country. if you lower support prices. it is at least logical that people will probably produce less. It is not axiomatic. It may be that even with a lower support price. people will continue producing. but the Federal Government is not going to pay them as much to do it. For many years. specifically 1949 to 1977. several administrations gave the Secretary of Agriculture the power to bring the support price up and to lower it. as the case may be. to try to adjust to the problems of the dairy industry. For 28 years the system worked admirably. Unfortunately. in 1977. we went to break the bank. and we have succeeded In doing so ever since. There has been no correlation between supply and demand in dairying since 1977 and there will not be until the support price comes down. The HatchMoynihan amendment is permissive. The Secretary is not mandated to reduce the dairy support price. One might argue that $1.50 cut is inadequate. But that remains a pragmatic judgment of the Secretary. I would simply say to my colleagues. those who believe In the market system. those who have any desire to try to move toward fiscal sanity. even in one small part of agriculture. they would have to be in favor of this amendment. I simply wish in equity that we could say the same to producers across the board. Dairy people today will argue. ""Why are we in trouble? Why should we be bearing the burden of the MoynihanHatch amendment. whereas everyone else has gotten away scott free?"" There Is a problem of equity here. of course. but we have one opportunity. That is all the agriculture legislation that remains."
980117814,"Mr. President. this Is a day fIn which many Senators will continue to meet with the administration and with appropriate military officials with regard to events in Lebanon. I sutspect that it is for certain that all Senators who met with thle Secretary of State yesterday were Impressed with the gravity of the sittuation and the difficulties that ottr country faces. At the same titne we were unanimouis in resolve that security for our matines in Lebanon must be thte paramount consideration. We were assured by the Secetary of State that the Commandant of the Marine Cotps had been dispatched to Lebanon immediately to petsonally condutct those security operations. lie is to make certain that in every waty our marines who are there anid who tire In jeopardy. given the savage attack. are given every consideration and cvcty benefit of the doutbt in terms of any decisions *bat are mnade regarding the political and commercial events occurrIing now in the B~eirtt area. I think it Is also fair to snyv that there was a strong bipartisan feeling that we must stand behind the Plresident and our Secretary of State at this time. While Members on both sides of the aisle reserved the right to think through carefully the tnission of ot fotces in Lebanon. the military misSion. the political mission. and the sense of our International responsibilities that has been evident in thle debates on the War Powers Act. there is not unanimity as to what that mission is and how well it has been ftulfilled and really what it ought to be. It Is important that this dialog take place in a constructive and in a timely manner. Thle cotuntry depends upon that. I would simply add. Mr. President. that I appreciate. as an Individual Senator. the good will that was evident In the mneeting with thle Secretary of State. It was a time. as the Secretary of State mentioned in his remarks to us. in which we as Senators have ev~ery right to be upset. The Atmerican people are upset. The Secretary of State indicated that he was under great stress. But even in those conditions of stress. we have a responsibility for wisdom. We have a responsibility * riiis ""bullet- syflihol idicait ific staItementsL or insertions w hich are not spokeni by the Niember on the floor. first. of all. to secure thle safety of our marines and then to think very carefully why we are in Lebanon anid what we should be doing there. We have a responsibility to see how wye can engage the attention of the world to the situations there that can stand improvement and what really is in the cards in terms of probability of improvement. I would add just one thing. Mr. President. As a member of the Intelligence Committee. I will very shortly be proceeding to a meeting of this committee which is in progress. I mention this just as a matter of record. that it has been in fact the agreement wvith thle administration anid with the Select Committee on Intelligence. as events occur contemporaneously or nearly as soon as possible. there will be full consultation and briefing of the Seiect Committee on Intelligence. That is in fact taking place in regard to events currently occurring in Grenada. I mention that without. at this point. having had the benefit of that btiefing or consultation. I look forward. as do other Senators who have that responsibility. to availing myself of that information in the next few minutes. Mr. President. I yield back my time."
980220116,"Mr. President. I have learned much from Senator NUNNs contributions over the years to Senate debates on national security matters and issues of strategy. I think I understand the intent of this amendment. and I share with him some of the frustrations and concerns in achieving a more equitable sharing of the defense burden by our NATO allies. I fully recognize the strong imperative for increasing NATOs conventional capabilities in order to have a true flexible response. with no semblance of an extended tripwire. The issue Is: Will this amendment in its present form. and particularly because of its timing. have its intended effects if enacted now? Or. will.enactment of this amendment now have precisely the opposite effects? There are several factors that enter into my judgment that enactment of this amendment at this time will produce consequences that would be totally at odds with the intention of the amendments sponsor. First. our European allies are still contending with the fallout from the INF deployment decision. The Soviet Union engineered and is still pursuing a massive campaign of intimidation against the deploying countries. Yet. all basing nations with one exception have stayed with the 1979 INF deployment schedule. These deployments indeed constitute a major ongoing effort to redress the middle leg of the triad of flexible response which has been of concern to Members of this body. Our European allies have met the test of sharing the burden in the deployment of these systems. These deployments in the face of Soviet intimidation efforts and massive demonstrations in the streets is a reflection of the willingless of European governments to buttress the NATO deterrent. Equally important. the emergence of the alliance from major test case of its vatality and cohesion has been accompanied by attitudinal charges and a growning conviction that more must be done to improve the conventional leg of the triad. The last two meetings of the NATO Defense Ministers are testimony to the fact that the alliance has begun to shift the focus of its attention from the now successful inprovements of NATOs theater nuclear posture to means of enhancing the alliances conventional posture. There has emerged from those meetings an impressive consensus on the need for better conventional defense through such measures as improved sustainability and exploitation of emerging S 77:36 technologies. These are measures long supported by Senator NUNN. European support for such measures is reflective of conclusions drawn from debates in Europe over the dangers of reliance on any kind of extended tripwire. Discussions of NATO strategyeither its alteration or the development of capabilities to meet the current oneare to be encouraged. Mr. President. there are three essential prerequisites to a stronger NATO conventional option: First. a broad alliance consensus regarding the threat. second. a similar consensus that deterrence of this threat requires enhanced conventional defense. and third. a widespread belief that this can be generated at a cost politically acceptable to free societies. The feasibility of any NATO conventional option will depend critically on these prerequisites being met. However. enactment of this amendment is unlikely to contribute to a more enlightened debate on NATO strategy. nor to an alliance willingness to draw the appropriate conclusions from such a review of strategy. It is worth remarking that the prospects for enhancing the conventional defense posture seem greater than at any previous time in NATOs 35 years. While deterrence remains NATOs overriding aim. the advent of nuclear stalemate has endangered a growing recognition that nuclear deterrenceonthecheapeven cheaper for the Europeansis eroding in credibility. The result has been a renaissance of interest in conventional deterrence in both Europe and the United States. particularly since the gap between Warsaw Pact and NATO conventional capabilities is for wider than in nuclear capabilities. This is not to suggest that nuclear deterrence has been robbed of all credibility. but only that the NATO nuclear deterrent is no longer to be relied upon as heavily as in past decades. In effect. NATO is in a period of strategic transition from primary reliance on nuclear deterrence toward a more balanced flexible response posture which its strategy has long called for but which the alliatice has never adequately funded in practice. The fact of the matter is that NATO is already buying and paying for the great bulk of the capabilities required to develop a credible conventional defenseat least in the crucial central region. With European NATO already spending over $100 billion per annuni-(1982 figure)-on defense. an approximately 25 percent real increase over the level of a decade ago. and the United States spending even more. NATO is already within shooting distance of this goal. Yes. it may seem strange that. when they are rdready spending so much. the Allies have seemed unwilling to fund the relative ly modest additions necessary to maxi mize the deterrent value of the huge sums that they already collectively invest. Nonetheless. it has been a political fact of life that. with economic recession throttling much of Europe. even modest increases on the order of 3 to 4 percent in real defense spending per annum could not be funded by NATO parliaments. Under these circumstances. the only viable solution has appeared to be efforts to impose stricter priorities. focus as much as possible on lowcost measures. seek realistic phasing. stress more rational burden sharing. and seek offsets and tradeoffs within existing defense program levels. Third. the Department of Defense has laid before the Senate a report on improved conventional defense. a report containing some 30 recommendations. The Senate displayed concern and imagination in requesting this report. However. all parties concerned need some time to digest these recommendations and to arrive at considered judgments with respect to priorities for implementation. I would expect the Senate to take a lead in attempting to translate these recommendations into action programs. In short. the United States and its allies are becoming more specific on how the allies can do more in the conventional sphere. But wethe Senate. the Department of Defense. and the alliesneed some time to react. Enactment of this amendment could well derail. if not scuttle. efforts to implement many of these recommendations. Further. Mr. President. I would note that in a few days time Lord Carrington will take over as the new Secretary General of NATO. Lord Carrington is not only well acquainted with congressional concerns about more equitable burden sharing within the alliance. he has also made known the priority he will attach to enhanctug the alliances conventional force posture upon his assumption of office. Lord Carrington will need positive support from Washington as he undertakes this task. support that could be seriously eroded if this amendment is enacted. Moreover. Mr. President. in the aftermath of the ""Euromissile"" debate and at a time of chilled SovietAmerican relations. political harmony and cohesion within the alliance are a prerequisite to improved EastWest relations. After a period of Soviet intransigence with respect to all Western efforts to revive the EastWest negotiating process. and with the recent calls by the President to the Soviet leadership to sit down with us to discuss EastWest issues. we may be seeing some light at the end of the cold EastWest tunnel. Yes. this amendment may be intended to send a signal to our allies. But it would also send a very unhelpful signal to the Soviet Union. a signal that could constitute an open invitation to Moscow to redouble its efforts to drive a wedge between Europe and - North America. And yes. it could lessen rather than encourage Soviet interest in dealing seriously with the United States on a variety of strategic and global issues. We must not do by legislation what the Soviets have failed to do with threats and intimidation. During the months ahead. as we seek to revive the EastWest dialog. unity is particularly important between and within the NATO countries. Mr. President. the issue as well is how to move forward with conventional improvements at a time when European economic recovery lags behind the U.S. recovery. First. we have to make better use of existing NATO resources. Second. we need to increase the contribution of defense resources by all NATO partners. Senator NUNN has been in the lead of encouraging NATO planners to develop a more effective resources strategy. In particular. efforts have to be undertaken to promote more effective armaments cooperation. both transat.lantic and within Western Europe. and further. we must move forward with the sound application of new technologies. The more effective use of resources through improved NATO planning will in turn strengthen the political support in allied countries so necessary for increased NATO contributions. An Increase in the amount of resources devoted to defensethat is. a greater burden sharing on the part of our alliescannot be exacted through threats. Such increases can only flow from a European appreciation of the fact that European security is enhanced by improvements in the conventional leg of the triad. From my travels in Europe and from conversations with European officials. I am convinced that European governments. despite relatively poor economle conditions at present. want and will move in this direction. In sum. Mr. President. concerns expressed in this body in the past over the need for more equitable burden sharing on the part of our allies have had an impact in Europe. We are beginning to see the allies move in the direction that we have long advocated. However. an amendment of the kind that we are currently debating. despite its constructive Intent. can only be misinterpreted In Europe and will pull the rug out from under recent efforts and advances to enhance our conventional force posture. Such an amendment. if enacted. would prove especially harmful and dispiriting to those European governments and parties who have painfully held.the line against opponents during the INF debates and sought to move publics in the direction of improved conventional defense. We cannot allow our commitment to and interests in NATO to become hostage to the politics of the day. Moreover. we should take no comfort from the fact that any reductions proposed in the amendment. if certain conditions are not met by our allies. would only take effect at the end of 1987. Passage of this amendment in its present form will invite immediate reS 77:37 action in Europe which could Interrupt precisely those efforts of the day by our allies that are leading in the direction of an improved conventional capability. If the proponents of this amendnent are primarily interested in shaping the terms of reference for the policy debate on this issue. I applaud this intention. And the debate currently underway in this body will go a long way in that direction. However. passage of this amendment would destroy the prospects for a meaningful debate with our allies and derail current and planned efforts to work toward an improved conventional deterrent. Mr. President. we are asking the American people to make sacrifices in the interest of a strong national defense. We can do no less in urging our NATO partners and European publics to make equally painful sacrifices in the interest of Western security. Without burden sharing. there can be no collective defense. The views of the Congress. and the Senate in particular. must be heard on this issue. There should be no dobut in the mind of any European ally that this body stand for a strong alliance. a credible strategy. and the capabilities to meet the strategy. However. I do not believe that those objectives are furthered by enactment of this amendment. 7. too. pledge that the concerns of this body will be transmitted to our allies at every opportunity. The message of the need to make better use of existing NATO resources in defense and to increase the contribution of defense resources by our European partners will be delivered loudly and clearly. Mr. President. I would urge my colleagues to work with our allies in Jimproving the Alliances conventional force posture. For that reason. Mr. President. I would also urge my colleagues to reject the Nunn amendnl(t. Mr. President. I deeply appreaciate the Senator from Maine yielding to me so that I could present this statement. I applaud his efforts of a constructive intent. which I know will be coming before the Senate."
980274235,Mr. President. HOWARD BAKER was elected leader of Republicans in the Senate on January 3. 1977. by a vote of 19 to 18. The Presidential election of 1976 had not been kind to Republicans but eight freshman Republican Senators were sworn into the Senate on January 3. 1977. and HOWARD BAKER appealed. successfully. to a substantial majority of that group. I remember receiving a telephone call from HOWARD BAKER at 4 p.m. on January 2. He asked me for support for leader and in response to my question. he affirmed that he thought he had at least 13 supporters. I gave him my personal commitment and sought to find others. I will always count that vote among the most significant that I have cast. Every expectation that I had for HowARDS leadership was fulfilled abundantly. again a id again. He will be remembered as the Republican leader who led the Republican Party in the Senate to accept responsibility for the governance of this country as a majority party. The transition form a quarter of a century of vigorous opposition to acceptance of the chairmanship of committees and subcommittees and responsibility to work with the President could have led to many stumbles and subsequent lack of confidence. From the first legislative day in 1981. it was apparent that HOWARD BAKER would be chief advocate of President Ronald Reagan in the U.S. Senate and that he would attempt to obtain 51 votes for every reasonable administration proposal. He won those votes with an extraordinary combination of intelligence. patience. humility. good timing. personal eloquence. and careful votecounting on all occasions. with generous accommodation for those Members who could not give help. immediately. but could be summoned to help in a later emergency. President Reagan articulated a bold series of programs. but they took on legislative flesh only because HOWARD BAKER was able to enlist a majority of Senate Republicans to debate and. occasionally. to improve upon original proposals before enacting them into Senate legislation. At a recent dinner. President Reagan summed up the feeling of all of us when he said that he could not bear to think of HOWARDS leaving the Senate because it simply hurt too much. I have cherished him as a mentor and a loyal friend. I have seen him in temporary defeat but never in total discouragement or despair. He has not lacked ambition as his three tries to become leader of Republicans in the Senate and his campaign for the 1980 Presidential nomination will testify. but he has been prepared to subordinate personal recognition to the demands as which the history of this country put upon his shoulders and he leaves the Senate with universal respect and affection for an unparalleled leadership achievement. Throughout all of this. his romance with Joy has continued and his pride in Cissy and Derek is enormous. He is a good. sound. and complete man fully prepared for new adventure and for important service to our country.

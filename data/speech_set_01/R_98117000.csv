980028025,"Mr. Speaker. yesterdays abhorrent attack on the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon was a wellplanned and willful attack on the U.S Government. The bomb was expertly planted to in. flict maximum property damage and high loss of human life. The death toll currently stands at 39. but is expected to rise as high as 80. We must not minimize the seriousness of this bombing. Under international law. an Embassy and its grounds are considered to be the territory. not of the host country. but of the Embassys country. Therefore. this bombing must be viewed as an attack on U.S. territory. I am appalled that there are some who are attempting to minimize the impact that this attack will have on the U.S. presence in Lebanon. We in this body have essentially endorsed our entire policy In the Mideast on two occasions on June 10. 1981. the House approved House Resolution 159. a resolution commending Philip Habib for his efforts to negotiate a Mideast peace settlement. The resolution went further than simply patting Habib on the back. it encouraged the President to pursue a comprehensive and coordinated policy in Lebanon. Then on September 28. 1983. the House passed House Concurrent Resolution 409. a resolution regarding the massacre of Palestinians in Lebanon. I voted against this resolution for very specific reasons. While I abhored the massacre of Palestinian refugees. I felt compelled to vote against the resolution because it granted carte blanche to President Reagan In the Mideast. stating that he should ""pursue every possible effort to bring peace to the Middle East."" This is a dangerous policy to pursue. The murderous blast that ripped through the Embassy was not an act of random violence. It was a carefully planned response to the U.S foreign policy of interventionisma policy supported and encouraged by this body in resolutions such as the two I have just cited. Since World War II. the United States has pursued an interventionist foreign policy. This policy has led to our involvement in distant regional conflicts that have no bearing on the genuine security interests of the United States. Often we have found ourselves in the awkward position of being allied to both sides of a conflict. as in the 11alkland Islands crisis. and the IsraeliLebanese conflict last summer. This policy has cost the United States $2 trillion since the end of World War II. and we have nothing to show for these huge expenditures. In the Middle East. for example. we first gave economic and military aid to Israel. then we gave aid to Lebanon to help them rebuild from the Israeli attack on the PLO in Lebanon. But the terrorist attack on our Embassy. while horrible and tragic. should come as no great surprise to anyone. There have been several attacks on U.S. marines stationed in Lebanon that should have forewarned us that such an event was imminent. I agree with the gentleman from Arizona in the other body who is calling for the withdrawal of U.S. marines from Lebanon. As this gentleman wisely points out. the day that one U.S. marine is killed. we will have to answer the question. What do we do? I believe that with this attack on U.S. territory. and the death of American citizens. the time to answer that question has arrived. In order to avoid U.S. involvement in a Mideast war. we must remove our troops from the region immediately. and return to the historical and traditional American policy of nonintervention in the affairs of other nations."
980048465,"Mr. Speaker. in the past few weeks and even today on the House floor the chorus of voices urging the convening of another international monetary conf:rence has risen to deaafening levels. The President has nL."" announced that if the subject is raised at the Williamsburg Conference this weekendas it most certainly will be raised by Francois Mitterandhe will agree to discuss it. The only model used however for such a conference is the Bretton Woods Conference held July 122. 1944. in ti1e hills of New Hampshire. I am convinced a new international CoD4RiSSiONAU CORD - HOI monetary coiference. like the first one 39 years ago. will lead us back intci the woods.. The Bretton Woods Conference es. tablished a very unstable international monetary system known as a gold exchange standard. The link to gold was rather weak. and it finally snapped in 1971. after a decade of international monetary crises. Simply put. the system established by the 1944 Conference made the dollar the foundation of the international system and all other currencies were directly fixed to the dollar. and only indirectly fixed to gold. Even though the dollar was loosely linked to gold. only certain privileged holders of dollarnonU.S. citizenscould Jet gold for their dollars. The result was predictable. During the period 194571. the U.S. Treasury lost over 400 million oinces of gold worth over $14.000.000.000 at the fixed price of $35 per ounce. One would have thought that this gold flight from the Treasury would have caused a few policy changes. but the only two of importance until i968 were the establishment of the exchange stabilization fund in 1961 in a futile attempt to bolster the dollar in international curiency markets. and the creation of the London Gold Pool in the same year in an effort to suppress the price of gold. In 1968 the situation became intolerable. The market price of gold exceeded $35 per ounce. and a ""twotier"" price systemofficial and market pricesemerged. This inherently unstable rigged price system collapsed completely in 1971. and Proildent Richard Nixon ended the Bretton Woods experiment in a 30 minute speech one Sunday afternoon in August. Even while it lasted. the Bre tton Woods agreement did not work. Billed as a system of fixed exchange rates. theie were thousands of devaluations in the 194571 period and dozens of de.valuations even among the major currencies. What the agreement accome plished was .he exporting of American inflationthe Consumer Price Index rose at roughly a 2percent per year rate for the periodand the loss of American gold. Now we are being told that this conference is the model for the reformation of the chaotic world financial system. But rather than leading us to a sound world financial system. it will probably lead us to. a global system controlled by a world central bank. Robert Mundell. the supplyside economist. has already called for the establishment of a world central bank to administer a new Bretton Woods agi cement. Such a policy would be a catastrophe. Today conditions are even less favorable than in 1944. The gold is gone and the productivity of the United States is on the wane. Rather than government control of the worlds flnancial system. we need less control and more reflacern the free market system and an honest kld standard. Fixed cxchangerates. without a real standard of value such as gold linking our currencies. nothing but persistent inflationary and.linancial chaos can result. We can have freedom and sound money. both nationally and Internationally. by adopting a gold standard. But such a standard would be incompatible with a world central bank or an IMF. and it would unemploy thousands of international bureaucrats. To achieve freedom and sound money. we .do not need another summit meeting. we need only to act. Were we to adopt a gold standard. all our major trading partners would be compelled to follow suit withIn a matter of months. simply to protect their own currencies from a strong dollar. The world would then be on an international gold standardmonetary stability without tears or an elitist system managed by thedinternational bankers. The choice is quite clear Shall we continue in our futile attempAs to control economies by force of international agreements. of shall we choose free markets and gold? If we reenter the Woods will we ever get out? I doubt it."
980083431,I think the gentleman makes a very good point. And my amendment. if it were adopted. would mean that the President must have consent from Congress and allow us control over the pursestrings once again. Some have described the IMP as necessary to maintain stability and order. The IMF is the cause of the instability and the disorder. We are trying to address an international banking crisis because we no longer have a money of account. Nobody knows what the money is in this country. It is called a Federal Reserve note. A piece of paper that is printed out of thin air. Internationally we create credit and funds out of thin air through the IMP. That is all it is. It is a fancy organization to create credit to steal wealth from one country and transfer it to another country in a very. very sinister way. So for the IMP to create SDRs out of thin air is doing nothing but creating international inflation. We cannot expect in the long *un that the IMP will restore order under todays circumstances. We cannot correct a disease of the unit of account by* coming up with some fancy banking regulations and more inflation. The disease in this country. the disease internationally. is inflation. And inflation is the increase in the supply of money and credit for political reasons. You cannot solve that problem by more inflation. more regulations. more gimmickry. That is what this is all about. it is gimmickry in order to avoid the real issue. And the real issue is: Do the politicians have the moral right to create money out of thin air? And until we address that issue we will never solve the serious problems the international financial community faces. A commodity money standard. such as gold. is the only rolution available to us if we expect to achieve long term stability. Continuing to prop up a massive pyramid of debt with more debt and more credit creation may temporarily help but ultimately it will contribute to the seriousness of the international banking crises that is sure to come. I cannot. nor do I believe that any Member can. turn stones intobread. The power to create wealth. or real money. out of nothing is not available to us. We are deceived into believing we can achieve a positive good by perpetuating the fraudulent scheme of fiat money. whether it is in our domestic or the international monetary system. For this reason the IMF bill must be defeated.
980087910,"Mr. Chairman. I am a bit disappointed about how things have transpired with this particular piece of legislation. because it is going to be most difficult to have any discussion since the debate has been closed out rather early. But I do have an amendment here which I think Members should take serious note of because I think it is a significant improvement in the legislation that is before us. One of the arguments that we have heard throughout the debate has been that we must support our President. and this is not the first year that that argument has been used. As a matter of fact. I remember as far back as 1976 this was the same reason we had to vote and acquiesce in going along with the administration because they made these commitments. I know it is very tempting for partisan reasons to go along with these commitments. The statement has been made that the President has been somewhat embarrassed because he used to be against the IMP. now he is for the IMF. and now he has made international commitments. and it would be a bit embarrassing for him not to have the funds. Of course. I consider it a bit embarrassing to my constituents to go to them and take from them what is theirs and give to some banker or some foreign nation what is not theirs. So I think the issue is very clear. It is a moral as well as an economic issue. The intent and the purpose of my amendment would mean that the President no longer can go and make these commitments. He signs these commitments. and then uses this as a leverage. coming back to the Congress and saying. ""I have made these commitments."" This in no way would preclude him from negotiations. but he could not be able to make the commitment. Present law today requires congressional consent after the fact. but this is after the meetings have been held. This would mean the President. regardless of the administration. would come to us and say. ""Look. we want to commit another $8 billion or another $15 billion of American taxpayers money or credit."" and no matter what you call it. it is going to cost the American taxpayer something. They would have to come to us first and tell us what they are doing. rather than going and having these international conferences. signing these commitments. and practically having a treaty commitment and putting the prestige of the Presidency on the line. The amendment is rather simple. It would just mean that they must come to us first to get this permission. I think this is a very appropriate amendment for this time. We have had an attack by the courts on the legislative veto. I think it is very clear in the Constitution what our responsibilities are with the power of the purse. It is up to us to take care of the spending and the taxes. and yet we so easily give in to the administration on this commitment and go along with what they have said. This would prevent that. I think this is a much better way of doing it. rather than waiting for that crisis period. and then the administration coming and saying. ""If you do not fund the IMF tomorrow. the banking system is going to collapse."" I had somebody call me not too long ago. since the last time we had the IMF on the floor. a rather well known banker in a large bank in Houston. who said. ""Please do not offer your amendments."" because I was obstructing. I cannot quite understand how I am obstructing when I never even had a chance to present one single amendment. He said. ""Well. the banking situation is so bad that if you present your amendments. this might help precipitate a banking crisis."" I said. ""You know what? I have four amendments."" At that time I had four amendments in the RECORD. I get 5 minutes apiece. I thought. boy. if my talking for 20 minutes could have some effect on the international banking situation. then I never realized what a powerful individual I was. But quite frankly. it has nothing to do with what I am offering here on what the situation is internationally. That was created in a time past. past inflation. past abuse of the system by those who desire to cling to power. This is an issue.of power that we are dealing with today. Who has the power of the money. the power of the purse? I think the power of the purse is and should be in the hands of the Congress. So. therefore. if you happen to believe that. you would have to vote ""yes"" on this amendment. saying that the administration should * come. present to us what the plans are. It is said they need $8.4 billion in the IMF this year. but the plain truth is that that is a token amount of what they really need to prop up the system. The system no doubt is in trouble. The question is: Who is going to suffer the consequences. Are the notes and the loans going to be rolled over? Will the responsibility fall on the backs of the bankers and their stockholders or is it going to fall on the backs of the American taxpayers? It is as simple as that. A year or so ago when Poland met their crisis. only about onehalf of their debt was insured by governments. The other half was private loans that were rolled over and extended by the private banks. They choose not to foreclose and it is in their interest not to foreclose. I ask for an ""aye"" vote on this amendment."
980095350,"Mr. Speaker. in the attack on KAL 007. America lost a loyal friend. LARRY McDONALD was a constitutionalist. an advocate of freedom. and an opponent of communism and socialism. the ideologies that have engulfed half of the worlds population in blood and war in the past 70 years. In the Introduction to LARRYS 1976 book. ""We Hold These Truths."" subtitled ""A Reverent Review of the U.S. Constitution."" Dan Smoot wrote: If the Constitution does not mean what It says. then we have no Constitution: We are ht the mercy of lawless government... Never. In my happiest daydream. did I ever Imagine a Member of the United States Congress writing a book like this one... Congressman Larry McDonald indicts everyone and everything that gets In the way of a Constitutional principle.. .. The book factually ilustrates the awful consequences of allowing our hired public servants to disobey the fundamental law of the land....That Is what I think of Congressman McDonalds book. What do think of him? I think we Americans have found ourselves a Statesman. LARRY MCDONALD was a statesman. that is why our loss in his death is so great. His understanding of the importance of constitutional government may be seen In these words: Other constitutions and bills of rights sssume that all power is inherent In government. but government should be contractually obligated to provide certain rights for the people. The Soviet Union hss a ""bill of rights."" contained In a written constitution. It Is a long series of statements listing what government promises to do for the people. It promises them social security. medical care. child care for working mothers. maternity leave. schooling. and equal rights for men and women. In the American Bill of Rights. not one such promise Is made. Our Bill of Rights. (as well as our Declaration of Independence and Constitution) assumes that all power Is Inherent in the people. Our Bill of Rights contains 462 words. telling the federal government what it must not do. Congress shall make no law is the opening statement In our Bill of Rights. It expresses the old American conviction that the greatest threat to a mans life. liberty. and property is the government under which he lives. It recognizes that government Is like firenecessary to civilization. but deadly if it gets out of control. The unprovoked attack on a Korean airliner by a government out of control starkly punctuates LARRYS words. LARRYS anticommiunism flowed from his love for freedom. As the worlds most successful and implacable enemies of freedom. the Communists attracted LARRYs. attention and anger. It is not ironic that this intransigent defender of freedom was killed by the Communists. it was almost predictable. LARRYs love of freedom and hatred for totalitarianism made him few friends in Washington. D.C. Congress assaults freedom daily. and daily seeks to curry the favor of totalitarians by extending loans and credits to Comnmunist regimes around the world. The Washington establishment was annoyed by LARRYS voice. for he insisted on pointing out that their most cherished beliefs about communism were false and would lead only to a global disaster. Far from being a warmongeras his McCarthyite detractors have pictured himhe was a man of peace. I In ""We Hold These Truths"" LARRY wrote: All foreign aid should be stopped. Our participation in multination pacts. ouch as NATO agreements and the UN Charter. should be formally terminated. Our troops should be withdrawn from foreign lands. and our armed forces trimmed down to such size as is needed for the defense of our homeland. We should return not only to traditional American foreign policy. but also to traditional diplomatic procedures in tha handling of our foreign affairs. Those are hardly the words of a warmonger. But those who continue to subsidize the Soviets cannot so easily escape the label. It is the Wests subsidies to the Communists that have built the Soviet Unions militaryindustrial complex to its present worldthreatening proportions. The continued pursuit of such a suicidal policy will Insure that KAL 007 will happen again and again. I am convinced that the best tribute that can be paid to a fallen friend Is to take his ideas seriously. This Congress and all America would benefit greatly by taking LARRYs ideas about limited government as seriously as he himself did. He dreamed of a world in which governments. as well as the governed. would be limited by law. He was murdered by one of the bloodiest and lawless governments that has ever marred the face of the Earth. In his death. the battle lines were drawn: freedom or totalitarianism. the rule of law or lawlessness. a Christianstyle civilization or a materialist slaughterhouse. I hope that his life and his death will not be forgotten by the people he was trying to warn."
980101738,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong opposition to this resolution. I think It Is a serious mistake. I would like to refer back to a little legislative history. In June of 1981. we were anxious to praise Ambassador Habib for the ""peace"" he brought about in the Mideast. In that resolution there was a statement that the House endorsed overwhelmingly that actually set the stage for what we are facing today. That resolution said that: The House of Representatives strongly encourages the President to pursue a comprehensive and coordinated policy In Lebanon Including the development of an effective H17578 CO ceasefire. resolution of the issue of Syrian missiles. promotion of the independent sov. ereignty. unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon. That resolution was passed 398 to 1. That literally set the stage for the involvement we have in Lebanon today. This resolution. House Joint Resolution 364. 1 sincerely believe. is a capitulation. It is no compromise whatsoever on the war powers resolution. And we are literally reneging on our responsibilities as Congressmen and Representatives of the people. We are reneging on our responsibility that is given only to Congress that only we can declare war. I do not see how we can prevent the escalation if It is necessary in order to preserve the lives of the marines in Lebanon. and that we. by passing this resolution. literally give license to the administration to pursue a more extended war. The American people I do not believe endorse the involvement in Lebanon and if a referendum was taken they would wholeheartedly endorse our getting out of Lebanon and not becoming increasingly involved as we have been. For the past couple of years we have subsidized and helped both sides of the war over there. We have rescued the PLO when Israel was about to do the PLO In. And what do we find now? The PLO Is back In Lebanon. shooting at our marines. And we actually financed both sides. Israel at that time was able to take care of the PLO and yet we marched in. rescued the PLO and now we still have them to contend with. During the bombing of Beirut. bombing with weapons that we paid for. we on this House floor had a bill with foreign aid in It where we tripled the foreign aid to Lebanon to rebuild Beirut during the time the bombs were still falling. This in a fooihardly policy. It is time the American people woke up and decided there Is a more sensible policy that we could pursue. We have less peace in Lebanon now than a year ago. There is no peace and yet they say there is no war. If there is no war. there can be no victory. All we need today Is one Russianbuilt missile to hit one of our ships and It be sunk. I believe we would face catastrophe. an International and world catastrophe. I do not know how we could prevent It. Our purpose there is not definable because we do not know what our purpose is. The policy of foreign Involvement and interference Is a policy the American people are questioning. It has failed us for the past 70 years and the sooner we admit It the better. The numerous mutual defense pacts that we have committed our sons and tax dollars to are unwise investments. How many believe that there is anything mutual about our allies coming to our aid In a time of need? Yet our citizens are continually being drained"
980161092,Mr. Speaker. we have witnessed in the last few months something at which the Founding Fathers would have been horrifiedthe unconstitutional jailing of Christian fathers whose only offense was to enroll their children in a churchrelated school. We need to look seriously not only at this specific incident but consider what it portends for our society. All of us are well aware that thousands of American families are pulling their children out of public schools. which they fear are threatening their childrens physical safety and corruptIng their childrens moral development. These parents are enrolling these children in what has become a thriving Christian school network. Many of these schools are turning out excellent students who score high on standardized tests and are better equipped for college than their public school counterparts. We have an obligation to address the concerns of these parents and to ponder what we can do to help. It is encouraging that we have before us the opportunity to take two very positive stepssteps which will not only improve the quality of the public schools but advance the cause of individual freedom. First. we can restore to our public schools the right of our children to pray in them. I am in complete sympathy with parents who feel that the schools are eroding the Biblical values they are trying to instill in their children. replacing those values with a secular relativism that is Jbrectly antithetical to them. These parents yearn for redress of this imbalance. and prayer would be a big step in that direction. It occurs to me that we had prayer in our public schools for decadesdecades which were among the most productive in our history. It is time once again that we allowed our children to pray in their classrooms. It strikes me as ironic that those who call themselves civil libertarians have been in the forefront of the fight against school prayer. since school prayer. it would seem to me. is nothing more or less than the free exercise of religion. which is itself protected by the first amendment. But even more ironic is the fact that these ame socalled civil libertarians have also been in the forefront of the fight to keep all religious observances out of public places like our schools. After all. if the first amendment does not apply to public places. then it has no meaning at all. But here too we have a chance to correct this violation of the Constitution. There are before Congress several bills that would once again provide equal access to school facilities for students who voluntarily wish to assemble during noninstructional time for religious study and prayer. This. too. seems to me to be a clearcut first amendment issue. and it will be fascinating to see to what lengths critics will go to attack it. Finally. I would urge those friends of public schoolsthose who fear that such reforms as tuition tax credits would result in millions of children fleeing the public schoolsto begin to address the reasons that parents are taking their children out of the public schools and putting them in private schools. There are very good reasons that these parents are opting for private schoolsand restoring the free exercise of religion in public schools might be the best thing to happen to public education in our lifetimes.e
980221172,Madam Chairman. I rise to make a few comments as a physician about this particular piece of legislation before us. I do not challenge. actually I compliment. the gentleman from Tennessee for his humanitarian concerns and good intentions with this legislation. However. I am quite convinced that good intentions have very little meaning with the ultimate results of any of our legislation. There is no way we can equate good results with good intentions. I happen to think that this piece of legislation. when passed. because I assume it will be passed. will do nothing really to help the problem of distribution of human organs. The shortterm apparent benefits are there. but on the long run. I think we will be creating a lot more problems which will prompt more legislation. which will prompt more appropriations and actually make a more inefficient system than we could develop in a more voluntary way. Anything that we do in economics or in medicine. where our goal is to seek a more equitable and fair distribution of a good product. or organ. generally this can be achieved by the market better than by Government legislation. You can get more equity. but it is always at the sacrifice of those who are getting something fairly achieved. Actually. you never raise the standards. you get equity by lowering the standards and lowering the efficiencies. I think this will be the case with this legislation as well. If there is allocation of a scarce resource. and that is what we are talking about here. it still follows that the marketplace. that the private sector is better equipped to do this than a Government bureaucracy. I can see some analogies of this proposed legislation with that of any rationing legislation. even though it might not have the same rigidity of rationing. This is what we are introducing. If you want people to wait in lines as we did in 1979 after we decided we would allocate gasoline. this is precisely the longterm negative results of legislation like this. We do have one example in medicine that existed here a few decades ago that handled a similar problem. and I think in a magnificent way. in a voluntary way. in a regional way. and that was the allocation of blood. which is a human organ. It has been done voluntarily and fairly. Actually people are paid to donate blood and there has never been legislation proposed that I know of that says there is some heinous crime for a blood bank giving somebody $25 or $35 for the donation for a pint of blood. This generally has worked very. very well. I think if we would have had centralIzed control of blood distribution introduced 50 years ago. it would have been a very negative thing. Already we have seen in medicine and in the private sector in other humanitarian ways of solving this problem. some very good successes. For instance. the Red Cross is involved with blood distribution. we have the Living Bank of Houston which is very successful. we have the Lions Eye Bank. we already see the oil companies voluntarily providing jet aircraft and helicopters and making the transportation of organs much more economic than they would be otherwise. So to me. I think that there is a strong argument for rejecting this legislation. allowing the marketplace to work and rejecting the idea that we need to distribute organs somewhat the way we distribute mail. We do know that sometimes it takes a week or so to get mail delivered across the street. I think this is the type of program that is similar. So again I say I understand the motivation. I understand the good intention and I believe I have humanitarian concerns just as much as those who propose the legislation. but I do foresee some bureaucratic problems that will hinder the medical profession. the voluntary organizations from handling this job in a more efficient. effective manner.
980254044,Mr. Speaker. the recent furor over politics and religion raises very deep philosophical questions. A lot of confusion exists as to what is the proper relationship between the two. No one has ever suggested we not write laws against stealing because it is a religious principle not to steal. Everyone knows that laws against violent acts like theft and murder are justified and are also based on a moral code. It is not because of a narrow religious belief. be it Jewish. Christian. Catholic or Baptist. So why the confusion now over the role of religion in legislative matters? Mainly it is because laws today are passed for political reasons. not moral reasons. We find liberal Catholics who endorse abortion with convoluted justification and conservative Baptists wanting to outlaw drinking and gambling. These legislative decisions reflect political and religious prejudices and entirely ignores the moral basis of law. Religious prejudice and moral law are two entirely different things. It is true we cannot legislate morality. We can neither make society better. That Is the liberal approach. Nor individuals better. that is the conservative approach bypassing laws. But we can ask that all laws be based on moral principles of nonviolence and seek to protect life and liberty equclly for everyone since all persons have a natural right to live and be free. This principle may be found in many religions. but more importantly It is the key to a civilized society and political stability. Protecting the unborn in the political and legislative sense should not be done because it is Catholic doctrine just as outlawing theft is not done because it is Jewish doctrine. but rather because it follows the moral principle of law. Individuals can reject murder for religious reasons. Politically it is rejected because it is an act of violence. Individuals can reject alcohol. gambling. and birth control for religious reasons. but restrictions of these acts cannot be imposed on others because they are nonviolent acts. not harming others. The politician whose religion teachs abortion is wrong. and yet supports proabortion legislation for pragmatic reasons. justifying it by twisted logic. sells out twice. He sells out his religious beliefs and he sells out the principle of equal rights and nonviolence. Theft. murder. rape. fraud. are all illegal because they violate the moral principle of nonviolence and equal rights. Today. though. our laws are all jumbled up. encouraging and financing the killings of the unborn. permitting Government violence and theft in redistributing wealth in a welfare State. and prohibiting nonviolent victimless acts. Today we do not accept an overriding moral principle of nonviolence and equal rights to guide our legislative process. and those frustrated with this will do us no favor by substituting for it a narrow. religious doctrine telling each of us how we should live. The Founding Fathers talked of life. liberty. and the right to pursuc our own interests. not of wealth confiscation and redistribution. and making people conform to a religious behavloral code. Religious interference cannot be condemned on the one hand when it talks of protecting the unborn. and praised on the other hand when It preaches to freeze treaties. welfarism and subsidies to Third World radicals. nor can others condemn religious interference when it pushes for a socialist agenda and praise it when it supports armed Intervention for fascist states. Both groups are inconsistent and hypocritical. The dilemma can only be solved by accepting a natural rights philosophy guaranteeing life and liberty consistently for everyone. and rejecting all forms of violencedirect. Indirect. individual. and government. Mr. Speaker. I include In the RECORD at this point an article written a few years ago by myself dealing with this subject.
980257877,"Mr. Speaker. I have a deep concern for the direction in which our country is going. I have expressed this concern by pointing out the political and economic contradictions that surround us and have suggested that these contradictions merely are manifestations of philosophic errors made by our intellectual leaders. Although the country currently is more or less in a euphoric mood. I am convinced the errors we are making today will eventually result in a severe political and economic crisis. . I dont believe anyone precisely knows the future. yet we all make projections as to our expectations. Its impossible to know exact events and their timing but trends are known to us and certain policies do have specific consequences. Economically definable laws do exist and cannot be repealed. For what its worth. I would like to make a few comments about what we can expect if our current beliefs about Governments role are not changed. The odds of a significant change in attitude occurring in Washington in the near future are utterly remote. Repealing the welfarewarfare state may be popular with a growing number of frustrated American citizens. but that attitude is not yet reflected in Washington. The constituency for the monolithic state is alive and well in the U.S. Congress. When disagreement exists in areas such as welfare versus warfare: the poor versus the rich. labor versus business. compromise is always reached and both sides receive an Increase in funding. This is a policy of utter folly and is tragically locked in place. Government is literally out of control. Spending. taxes. regulations. monetary inflation. invasion of our privacy. welfareism to both the rich and the poor. military spending. and foreign adventurism around the world will one day precipitate a crisis that will truly test our will to live in a free society. If Government were not so much out of control. would not the most conservative President of the last 50 years been able to do something about the runaway deficits? The deficits have tragically only gotten very much worse under Reagan. All the problems we face. high interest rates. inflation. deficits. vicious business cycles with accelerating unemployment are serious problems indeed. but the real threat under the conditions to come will be the potential loss of our personal liberty. Without liberty. prosperity is lost and equality of poverty prevails. We have a cancer in the landthe malignant growth of big governmentand we can ignore it. treating only the symptoms. hoping they are not reliable signs that a horrible disease has struck our Nation. But if we do. we are treating our problems as some foolishly deny the early signs of cancer. by taking aspirin and hoping the pain to be only that of inconvenience and that the symptoms will go away in the morning. Instead. the pain gets worse requiring more and more narcotics to numb the pain. Magic cures are sought and tried. Although big government is the disease. attempts to solve all the problems by making government even bigger and more intrusive in our lives are continually tried. This will soon end. We cannot forever ignore the root causes. Its highly unlikely that well reach the 1990s without a convulsion of our economic and political system. Although nothing goes up or down in a straight line. we can be sure the long term will bring us everincreasing interest rateshigher with each cycle and over 20 percent before this cyble completes itself in 1986 or 1987. Without the introduction of a commodity money. one with qualityas well as limitation on its quantitywe will never see the return of longterm fixed low interest rates. The reform will come eventually. if were to continue to have even a relatively free society. I just hope we dont wait too long. Price inflation. although difficult to predict on a monthtomonth or even yeartoyear basis. will reach unbelievable heights in this decade. Currency destruction. through the Insatiable desire to create massive new flat monetary units. must eventually bring higher prices. Wage and price controls will return regardless of whether a Republican or a Democrat occupies the White House. Free market rhetoric will do nothing to protect Vs from the pressure the administration will receive to ""do something."" even if its the wrong thing. Nixonian Keynesianism will continue to dominate. and abusive people control in the form of wage. price currency and credit controls will return. more vicious than ever before. There will come a day that the world financiers will rush from dollars just as they have recently rushed into dollars. causing even worse chaos in the international financial markets. Without a stable monetary unit. the speculation will continue and worsen. Overreaction is now becoming more commonplace. but this is a predictable consequence of a world gone mad with fiat currencies. debt creation. and overspending. Massive debt .liquidation will come. The early stages have already started. It will occur with oldfashidned defaults. threats of deflation. and further currency destruction through monetary inflation and liquidation of debt with a depreciating dollar. Whether or not the liquidating debt collapse will1 be dominated by deflation or inflation of the money supply is yet to be determined since that will depend on Government actions and many market forces.. An inflationary collapse is a more likely scenarioknowing the special interest. the Congress. the administration. and the central bankers unwillingness to face up to the reality of cutting spending. balancing the budget. and curtailing the supply of money. So in spite of all the tough talk. we can expect the Fed to accommodate and reverse any trend toward deflation. Without a significant change in attitude by the American people and Congress as to the purpose of government. the choices are horrible. an inflationary collapse or a deflationary one. The form and timing of the collapse is yet to be determined. the event itself is certain. This crisis will come. as others have. because we refuse to face up to reality and live within our means. The peoples insatiable appetite for the goods of life without providing a commensurate amount of work and effort needed toproduce them (while demanding that politicians deliver the loot) guarantees the process will continue. But a penalty will have to be paid. That penaltya major banking. currency. economic. and political crisiswill hit this Nation and the western world. most likely before the 1990s. The economic hardship. of which we had a taste in 1981 and 1982. will be much worse. That in itself is bad enough news. but historically. when a Nation debauches its currency international trade breaks down (today 40 percent of. international trade is carried out through barter). protectionist sentiments rise.(as they have in Congress already) eliciting hostile feelings with our friends. Free trade alliances break down. breeding strong feelings of nationalism. economic isolationism. and militarismall conditions that traditionally lead to war. a likely scenario for the 1990s. unless or economic policies and attitudes regarding government are quickly changed. Many who concede we are moving in this direction of war. carelessly believe that the lack of military spending is the problem and insist on new massive military spending as the solution. This only serves the inflationists. the internationalists. the banking elite. and industrialists who benefit from the massive manufacture of military weapons. It ignores the important fact that most military conflicts throughout history have been the consequence of economic events. Economic events. when combined with a foreign policy void of wisdom and fraught with folly. sets the stage for needless war. Conservatives are quick to correctly point out that guns dont cause crime. criminals do. but fall to see that weapons. or the lack of massive weapons. dont cause war. politicians bad policies do. This is a good reason why the current conservative administration should have stopped subsidizing trade and foreign assistance to the Soviet bloc nations and to Red China. which includes nuclear and military technology. instead of increasing it. This is sheer madness. Massive military spending to stop the spread of communism which our own taxpayers are also required to finance. contributes to the economic problem of deficits. inflation. and high interest rates. In addition it justifies. in the political world of compromise. increased domestic spending. higher deficits. accelerating inflation and higher interest ratesall compounding the economic problems that started the trouble in the first place. Depression and war are the needless consequences of politicians folly. They are prevented by limiting government power. not by expanding it. Today. campaign rhetoric is frequently heard about balanced budgets and reducing the size of the Government. witness the success of conservatives in 1980. yet nothing ever happens. The spending. the regulations. the taxing. and the deficits continue. Time is running short. the frustration running high. Hiding from reality wont help. kidding ourselves wont do. The sooner we admit. ""you cant get blood from a turnip."" the better off well be. SOLUTION What is the solution? Most importantly. a new attitude about the role of government is necessary if we expect to solve our problems. As long as we. as a nation. accept the notion that government is the ultimate provider and world policeman. implementing the elusive concept of liberty will be impossible. The degree to which governments are permitted to exert force over the people determines the extent to which individuals retain their liberty as well as the chances for peace and prosperity. Historically. governments have always initiated force against the people with disastrous results. America is the best example of what can happen if that force is restrained. thus maximizing individual freedom and prosperity. Yet today. that wonderful experiment is all but abandoned. We must once again clearly reject the idea that government force and threat of force can be carelessly administered. Voluntary contracts must be permitted. The trend toward government dominance. interference. and altering of voluntary contracts is prevalent and a most dangerous sign. Responsibility to care for ones self is necessary for a free society to function. and trust that individuals will look out for their own selfinterest. even if imperfectly. is required and should be achieved through contractual arrangements. Government interference in voluntary agreements between two parties must be strictly prohibited. Enforcement of those contracts in eventof a violation. invites the governments participation in settlement of the dispute. This limited involvement of government in voluntary contracts is necessary in a free society. The strict limitation of government power imposed by the Constitution must be respected. We must accept the principle that governments function is not to regulate and plan the econo. my. protect us from ourselves. arbitrarily attempt to make us better people. or police the world by interfering in the internal affairs of other nations. Its proper function in a free society is to protect liberty and provide for a common defense. When that proper role is assumed. our problems will vanish. To bring about real changes. we first need to recognize that the politician. per se. is a lot less important than it appears. He is basically a puppet of public opinion that reflects the prevailing ideas of the intellectual and thought leaders. John Maynard Keynes. in one of his more lucid moments. said: ""Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence. are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority. who hear voices in the air. are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back."" Media opinion is critical in establishIng popular views just as that same media may support or destroy certain political careers. Having accepted the philosophy of economic interventionism and political pragmatism. our society grants political knighthood to the highly paid lobbyists who represent the powerful special interests. But we must remember the lobbyists are the result. not the cause. of our problems. The politician is the puppet of the opinionmakers. Political success is the single goal that drives participants in our political system. No invitations to participants are sent to men of principle. upholders of equal rights. and defenders of the Constitution. Determined political aspirations under todays circumstances are key to achieving a successful political careerthe career being an end in itself. We must be aware that this system of politics is not conducive to bringing about changes necessary to solve our problems. The legislative and political intrigues that control the system for the benefit of the special interests must one day come to an end if personal liberty is to be restored. The resort to power to control people and the economy must be rejected. Also violence. to bring changes beneficial to liberty. serves no purpose (unless exerted in true defense under reprehensible conditions). The illicit use of power. even with noble intentions. has created historys dung heap of human misery. True change will come through persuasive intellectual influence. If the people refuse to listen. mere recording of significant movements in history will be the limited result of the effort. Yet. not making the effort to persuade the thought leaders to accept freedom and total nonviolence of the state. guarantees that the perpetuation of organized forcethe tyranny of the statewill flourish and the suffering will continue for all of us. Ideas do count. all government action is a result of ideas. Its incorrect to suggest that freedom ideas must. be rejected because they are idealisticthe planned economy is also a result of an idea. Its only a choice between good and bad ideas. The job of the true believer in liberty is to convince the majority of our leaders that freedom ideas are superior to the ideas of government coercion. Never can we relax by hoping that the good intentions of the big government proponents will protect us from the evils of government power that intimidate us all. All politicians. from total statista (Marxists and Fascists) to average conservatives and liberals of todays Con. gress. devoutly promise that all their actions are based on good intentions. But it doesnt matter: Bad ideas regarding the nature and role of government breed bad results and suffering occurs nevertheless. Twisted logic. Machiavellian justifications. excuse making. and shortrun benefits can never justify the removel of one iota of liberty from any one person if we intend to live in a free society. Once the role of government is agreed upon. and government initiation of force is rejected as a legitimate function. the consequences will quickly occurall positive. Individuals will reclaim their moral and natural right to their lives and liberty as granted to them by the Creator. The state will be put in its proper place as the protector of equal rights. not the usurper. That in itself should be enough reason to institute a system -of limited government. but the benefits go far beyond the moral justification of true liberty. Prosperity will abound and the chance for war will be greatly reduced. If this is done. the welfarewarfare state is repealed and spending by the Federal Government reduced by 80 percent. Special interest politicians will not be served and will vanish. Lobbyists will become mere petitioners for liberty. The budget will be immediately balanced and the debt repaid. No more wealth will be transferred to the poor. the rich. the foreigner. the bankers. or the arms manufacturers. Military spending will once again be used for defense and not for the domination of an unofficial American empi a. Money will be honest. the unit precisely defined. and its integrity guaranteed by government or by voluntary contracts. Counterfeiting privileges of the Fed will be abolished and relegated to notorious underground figures. Honest money will allow credit to be freely created in the market and not by the privileged banking cartel. yet controlled by the integrity of the market and the convertibility of the dollar. The economic benefits of lowlongterm fixed interest rates will be welcomed by all. since credit can then fuel true longterm economic growth. This scenario sounds utopian. yet its more practical than the ill effects of the planned society financed by fiat money and debt creation. Its dificult to.understand the persistence in following the impractical ideas of runaway government coercion. The philosophy of the free market. sound money. private property ownership and equal rights. offers the only real ""compromise"" to the impasse existing in Washington where only token attempts are made to cut the deficit. A truly practical approach to this dilemma can be immediately implemented. I suggest six points: First. instead of debating forever over whether or not the cuts should be made in domestic welfare or military spending. the answer is simple: Cut both. and quit arguingthat is. if anyone is serious about his declared hostility toward massive deficits. Second. all votes on spending should be tradeoffs. Welfare to the poor versus welfare to the rich: domestic aid versus foreign aid. aid to friends versus aid to Communists. water projects in the United States versus water projects in Africa. subsidized loans for steel plants in the United States versus those in South America. Sure. many projects will still exist inconsistent with a truly free market but these projects would only be financed by dropping expenditures elsewhere. Third. centralized planning fails everywhere else so we can expect it to fail with centralized control over bank credit. Sound money. and breaking up the credit/bank cartel. will solve the problem of high interestrates and longterm financing. Fourth. talks with the Soviets need not stopohly be redirected. But all subsidies to all Communists must end. We can discuss ways to enhance free trade and voluntary cultural exchanges. True friendly unsubsidized relations with even the apparent enemy go a long way toward reducing the chances of war. A nonaggressive purely defensive foreign policy which would prompt troop and missile withdrawals from Europe and elsewhere would be actions much stronger than all the political rhetoric heard surrounding disarmament conferences. Fifth. equal rights must be guaranteed and enforced regardless of circumstances of race color or creed. Equal rights cannot. however. be defined vaguely to include demands on anothers life or property. The goal of freedom must surpass our obsession with material wealth and its forced redistribution. Sixth. prosperity with freedom for the individual is the only humanitl rian system ever offered that prevnted mass starvation and suffering. Rt.asal to accept the free market based on a natural rights philosophy is the most impractical thing we can do. A system that provides sound money. low interest rates. the removal of the bankers monopoly over credit. and peace and prosperity will restore trust in the politicians. the money. the future. and in ourselves. More government . cannot possibly offer the solution to the problems we face. Big government is the cause. freedom is the answer."

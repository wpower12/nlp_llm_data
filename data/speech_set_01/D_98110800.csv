980009243,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself the balance of the time remaining. A number of speakers here have talked aboutnot putting the money in areas that do not need it. I would like to know where any of these areas are. Could anybody in this House tell me an area in this country that does not have high unemployment. It must be near an aircraft factory or a defense plant. I just. do not understand that if you have an area of 8percent unemployment. even though you have a contractor who can provide jobs he cannot have the project because the unemployment rate is below the national average. but somebody who is in an area that has 10 percent can have the contract. It just does not make sense to me. Now. for example. the gentlewoman from California brought up EPA. There is not any question about it. this amendment will interfere with those cities that need the money the worst. They will have to first go through the process of proving that they are within the 25percent allotment and then they will have to find out how much money there is for those places and where the money should go. There is no question about it that it is going to interfere with that process. And that is what is wrong with this kind of amendment. It is just a signal to those administering the program. to administer to death any of the programs in the bill they do not like. They will take all the time they want to draw up regulations and administrative procedures and then by next October 1 we will find out that people have not been employed. A number of speakers today have spoken of people whose unemployment compensation has run out. We have millions of unemployed who have never had a job and they do not all H 852 C( live in ghettos: they. do not all live ir socalled pockets of unemployment Many of them are minorities. but no all of them are minorities. The point is that they are unemployed and need a job whether they have not had one foi 3 or 4 years or since they graduated from high school. whether they live in one of these pockets of poverty or they live just outside one of these pockets. the approach taken in this amendment is just simply a bad way to do it. What we have done is take a national bill and turn it into a nonnational bill. We have splintered it up. We have taken a white dog and made a Dalmatian out of it. And it is not the way to treat a national jobs bill. Now I know the amendment is going to pass. We are all expecting it to pass. but I thought that it was important to bring these points out in this debate so that when we go to conference people are not expecting the provision to come back in exactly the same form that it went to conference. There are a lot of improvements which could be made in this amendment and I hope that there is more reflection on it and that it will be improved in conference.
980011607,Mr. Speaker. I bond guarantee program. m yield myself sizh time as I may eon- Itis generally agreed that this pro- Er sume. gram has been a great success. Not tel has It met its objective of helping lbusiness finance the cost of comng with environmental protection it actuslly earns the Government t profit because of interest earned scrow funds. addition. the program has a very default rate. Mr. Speaker. In the 6 weeks of 1983 big business ed well over *244 million worth of exempt .pollution bonds. This als the size of the entire SBA polon control program for this whole al year. Yet for reasons I certainly not understand. this administrais determined to deny these taxmipt pollution control bonds to 11businesses. nall businesses used to be able to . SBA loan guarantees. in conjunewith the Treasury Department sent. to pool these guarantees toher into one industrial revenue d Issue. The net result allowed al firms to finance their Governitmandated pollution control exditures at a moderate Interest rate. Ig businesses Alo not need the guaree or the pooling authority because their access to the capital markets the size of their bond issues. In ition. they are allowed to directly ue taxexempt pollution control ds. et. last year the administration ght to deny the same benefits to al . business. First they tried ough the Treasury regulations to iy small business the ability to pool ir pollution control bond issues and eive taxexempt status. The work of gentleman from Massachusetts r. CONTE) on the continuing rsolun has helped us overcome that obale. rext the administration tried to cut loan guarantee authority in SBAs utilon control program. The Small siness Committee in the House and the Senate restored those funds. w. the SEA. no doubt under orders mOMB. is refusing to Issue guarans to small businesses who wish to them in connection with taxempt revenue bond issues. nder siege from the administration activity has occurred In the only gram available to assist small busisses to finance pollution control exnditures. Small businesses are ueezed between complying with enonmental laws and not being able to ance the cost of compliance. lready several of the small busisses who applied to the program and ye been denied are threatened with nkruptcy. Last month the gentleman from issachusetts and I reinoduced our bill to deny the authority discriminate against small businessthat want to use SBA guarantees in nnection with taxexempt bonds. rhis bill Is cosponsored by all the embers of the -Small Business nergy and unvironment Bubcommiteinthe 97th Congress. March 10. .1983 Apparently the administration still does not recognize the need that exists for this program. Last month the administration proposed a deferral of the operating expenses for SBAs pollution control loan guarantee pro-. gram. Without this money. which supports salaries and overhead for the program. the administration would have the excuse to grind SBAs program to a halt. House Resolution 76 would deny the administrations deferral requests. Mr. Speaker. I ask you. how are small businesses supposed to meet their Government imposed obligations to improve the environment it the admihistration continually attempts to suffocate small businesses only opportunity to meet those obligations? The only alternative to the administrations actions on the part of small firms is bankruptcy. Mr. Speaker. you should know that we had a representative of the administration before my Small Business Subcommittee. We explained to him that the net result of what they were doing was to make taxexempt pollution control bonds available to big business and to deny them to small business. I asked him 1 he could be shown that they were discriminating against small business would they consider changing their position. and his answer was no. they would not. It is time for somebody to stand up here. Mr. Speaker. and speak out. and let the people know what is happening under this administration and how they are treating small business. which is a part of our total economy that brings us our jobs. that brings us our new developments. Mr. Speaker. if we are going to go ahead and continue to say we are going to do things for big business and freeze out small business. I have great sadness for the whole country that we. represent.
980063212,Mr. Speaker. I am surprised by the reaction that the news media and some Members o Congress have given to the Supreme Courts decision declaring the legislitive veto unconstitutional. It shiouli not have surprised anyone and the ducision does not have the Imiportance that has been attached to it. I always thought it was rather eleI mentary that it was unconstitutional because a provision in a bill permitting the Congress to veto executive department. action either means: First. that legislative power was delegated: or second. exercising the veto would be an usurpation of executive power. -Those who defended the constitutionality and logic of the legislative veto who were not caught on one argument. were caught on the other. The legislative veto Is a rather sterile tool anyway because time constraints are so great that it makes it impossible for Congress to exercise thle veto power on thousands of executive actions effctively. and it has not been effective. It has been used only a very few times. The decision did not shift power significantly as has been indicated because the legislative veto was of little Iimportance compared to the power of *thle purse which still remain3 in Congress. By attaching limitations to appropiations bills limiting the use of Federal funds In appropriations bills that the President must sign to secure money hie wants for programs. rules. regulations. and actions by departments can be rendered null by denying the use of any money for the next year to administer them. Appropriations which originate in the House of Representatives are for 1 year at a time. Tierefore. even if a department puts a rle or regulation into effect. it could be used only until the next appropriations bill is passed and some of the limitations have applied to prevent regulations being put into effect during the period the rule is being considered and before it is effective. As an example of effectiveness of limitations on an appropriations bill and the power of the purse. I personally have sponsored amendments to three different appropriations bills which killed three embargoes. Those amendments prohibited the use of funds to administer the embargoes. so they were effectihely dead. There are hundreds of other examples passed with the concurrence of the majority of the House and Senate each year. I am very surprised that the news media and some Members of Congress seemed to have completely missed this perspective and overlooked the fact that the power of the purse not only has been the principle tool to control excesses In the executive branch of the Government but also still remains that principle effective tool.
980116350,"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the last word and I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. I notice that the opposition to the amendment Is based upon its removal from the block grant rather than upon the program. I think that is for. good reason. I am sure the reason Is because it Is a good program. The gentleman from Illinois does not argue with that. This is a program that is a catalyst for recruiting private resources for a good purpose. It uses lawyers and Judges and legislators and police of ficers. and local and State officials to teach how lawrelated government works better than It does in dictatorships. I think that is what we should do. The American Bar Association has made a national program out of encouraging local lawyers and judges and others in government to cooperate with schoolteachers. to go to the school classrooms and to tell them why they should obey the rule of law and why our system is better instead of some other form of government. It enhances respect for the law. it enhances obedience of the laws. If there were to be a change in the bill. I would change the name. The name is not very descriptive of the program. ""law related education."" It Is really advanced civics or respect for the law and obedience of the law. I am chairman of the subcommittee that handles funding for the USIA and for the Department of State. They are proposing a $50 million program to do the same thing in other countries. to teach children. students in other countries to value the rule of law and the advantages of representative government rather than some other form of government. Here we have really a paltry sum compared to the purpose of encouraging students in our schools to understand and to obey laws. So I think it Is a good program and the gentleman from Illinois did not attack the value of the program. only the fact that it was in a block grant. Now. with regard to why it Is in the block: It is not an appropriate program to be in the block to start with because unlike other programs that were put Into that block. it had not been exposed to the local school districts. Local school districts had not had a chance to see its value or how it would work. because It had not been funded. and we did not have these programs to encourage training of these teachers and to tell them how to organize a course. how to recruit the local lawyers and the local Judges and the local public officials and Members of Congress and others to come to the classroom to teach students that. they should respect law and how our Government works. They had not been exposed to that. But also it Is Just like the close up program in this respect. it is not distributed uniformly to the local school districts each year on a dollar basis. In some years they will need some training for some of their teachers. in some years they do not. Not every district needs to have a training program each year bccause they iqay have the same teachers. some other districts will have a training program or a college will have a training program that the teacher can go to and get some education on how to recruit and how to use this program. So I want to say that I think it is not appropriate. really. to have been in the block to start with. and that is the reason In the appropriation we directed that the Secretary shall use some of his discretionary funds for this purpose. He has a $28 million discretionary fund and we directed that he use part of it for this purpose. And so I say to the Members that we should turn down this amendment. There are some people who are interested in the Close Up program. I dm not know how anybody who supports the close up program. would not support this program. because the Close Up program is for the same objective and accomplishes to some extent the same thing. but it uses far more money per student than the lowrelated program does. And any vote for this amendment would really be a vote against increasing the amount of money for the Close Up program. There Is no way that we can justify more for the Close Up program than for this lowrelated program."
980128638,"Mr. Speaker. lhe dlebate over thle passage of the bill app~roving a Martin Luther King hoiday. which thle President has now signed. so degenerated into repeating false or misieading information and innuendos concerning King. J. Edgar hloover. andi Robert Kennedy that many of those allegations are being belie~ved by millions of people and we are no(w threatened with the new holi(lay becoming an annual day for acrinmony ratlher than one for celebration. I was present at hearings of the subcommittee I now chair when extensive OffItlerecord discussions with J. Edgar Hoover explored thle whole subject miatter of telephone taps. Kings wssociations. and Robert Kennedys muthlorizat ion of the taps. Tlwenty years have now passed and I Iie reasons for keeping thle st at ements relative to King which were made at the hearing off thle record no longer exist. Inl view of the importance of the .subject matter at this time and the ntumber of downright false and mlisleading statements now being made. I hatve reserved this periodl to make a statemnent and reveal some informa. I ion I hope will make a contribution oward at better understanding of Ihest. matters. ShIce 1962. 1 have been a miember of thei suheommulit tee wvhich hndles the fuinding for tile Justice Department mid( tlie FIll and I now chair that subconimiilttee. Sine justifying thle Fl31 budget requests involves cases which have not yet been tried. open investigal ions. information which wouid expose confidential informiants. and s&curit V matters. thle hevarings are closed nld more sensitive Parts are oftenl (oilpletely off the record. On two or three occasions when J. Edgar Hoover appeared before the subcommittee and especially in the appearence on January 29. 1964. several of the offtherecord discussions dealt with the progress of the Investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy a few weeks earlier. and the substantial FBI resources being devoted to civil rights cases. including investigations of violence by some of the Kians. including some matters relating to Martin Luther King. which have been widely discussed recently. Directly involved were some telephone taps. It has now been decided by a court that tapes which include Martin Luther King as a participant in telephone conversations will not be released to the public for another 44 years but an attempt is being made to secure their release Immediately. First hand Information revealed at that 1964 hearing in response to questions. convince me that Irrelevant and false allegations have been made and repeated so often relating to these tapes and the reason for the taps that an injustice is being done to all involved. On that day. January 29. 1964. Hoover had testified that the FBI had a total of 64 telephone taps In existence. that everyone of thle 64 related to internal security. and that each one of the 64 taps had been authorized in writing by thle Attorney General. While many people assumed the PHI had thousands of telephone taps. while private investigators and companies were at that timeusing wiretaps on a wholesale basis and the investigation of President Kennedys assassination 2 months earlier was under way. the number of taps being used by the FBI had in fact been reduced from 95 the year before to 64. However. the fact that taps were limited to those authorized by the Attorney General and that he said the only ones In existence onl that date involved internal security raised the question whether Kings telephones were among those being tapped. and if so. how did his telephone f it into the category of internal security. The FBI was also heavily involved in Investigations of civil rights violations. so an extended discussion followed concerning the whole matter of the civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King and the extent to which the Justice Department and the FBI were involved. It was thle well known goal of thle Communist Party leaders at that time to infiltrate. exploit. and become active in organizations which they hoped might be influenced to use violence. At that time. thle Communist Party. U.S.A.. still labored tinder a belief that thle use of violence would help thenm accomplish their goal. and they had been successful In ifiltratIng a few labor organizations and a farm group. both of which eventually purged them. There were also those onl both sides of the civil rights movement who thought violence would seve their puirpose. and by early 1963. the FBI was devoting considerable resources to investigating civil rights violations including bombings. assassinations. and beatings which had already occurred or were being planned. They were securing information from within both the Kians and civil rights groups where there were militants prone to the use of violence. Under the circumstances in early 1963. killing or beating a leader in such a group could be the catalyst to a riot and it was that fear which a few months later caused the Kennedy administration to at first question the wisdom of the August 1963 civil rights demonstration at the Lincoln Memorial. Killing or beating a leader In any such group could be a catalyst to a riot and a few dedicated Communists were among those whose purpose would be served by influencIng militants or hiring a hit man to kill or injure a leader whose Injury could be blamed on the other side. Hoover told us that day that several months previous the FBI had obtained evidence that a handful of individuals had Infiltrated the movement led by King. and that two of these individuals were among several dozen considered to be the Inner circle. He was convinced that there was ample reason to believe these two individuals could be influenced by the leaders of the Communist Party. U.S.A.. that their primary allegiance was not to Kings nonviolent principles and that they would help create violence or be willing to help get King out of the way at an appropriate time to serve their purpose. Hoover also said he had no doubt whatever that King was a true student of Ghandi and totally opposed to violence and would not change and that Kings sole objective was to rectify legitimate grievances. Hoover said that to fulfill the FBI responsibility. he believed the PH1I should be authorized by the Attorney General to tap the tehcphone lines those two individuals used. Therefore. he gave the information to Robert Kennedy for his consideration. Since one of the two individuals who would be put under surveillance had access to some of the same telephones King used. in all likelihood tapes secured from taps on telephones they had access to would at times include Kings conversations even though his conversations were not a target of the tap. Hoover said that when Kennedy was presented with this. information concerning a possible telephone tap. Kennedys reaction was that since King was not an object for the tap. since neither he nor Hoover doubted that King was dedicated to nonviolence. and since protecting King from a threat to his safety was involved. he would talk to King before making a decision. According to Hoover. when Kennedy talked to King QI believe It was in June 1963). King was surprised at the Information concerning the Individuals In119296 valved and said he would look into it. but. shortly thereafter King told Kennedy purging someone In an organizaton such as he was leading was out of the question and besides. one of the Individuals was a valuable spccch writer whose services he did not want to lose. Shortly thereafter Kennedy signed the order authorizing the taps and King certainly knew from that time forward that telephones which those two individual associates had access to might be tapped and that calls they made to any other telephone might be taped. The ""I have a dream"" speech and the big rally at the Lincoln Memorial had occurred August 28. 1963. a few months prior to the January 1964 hearing. Hoover in the January 29 hearing also related how law enforcement officials becamne extremely concerned when they received information that one of the targeted individuals would be with King on the platform and that in fact that individual did stand only an arms length from King at the rallly. However. he said steps were taken to make sure that that individual would not under any condition be permitted to grab the microphone. A couple of months prior to that January 1964 hearing. King and Hoover had traded some insults publicly which led to a facetoface meeting between them. Hoover said he answered every question King asked at that meeting concerning the surveillance and that he had not heard from King in the 2 months that had expired since that meeting. It has been alleged that prior to the HooverKing meeting. King had not been aware of the wiretapping and that was the reason for the meeting. but according to Hoover and the events related above. that could not be true. While It Is highly unlikely that King told anyone else in his group. he was well aware during the few weeks prior to the August 28 Washington. D.C.. demonstration that two of his associates were under active surveillance. that he was being shadowed for his protection. and that telephone taps had been authorized. and why. Especially in the past few weeks during consideration of a new holiday. It seems to me that the relevant facts have been lost to most people. partly because some people have been limited to inadequate information and partly because some people have intentionally distorted the partial facts that are available. Unfortunately. none of the threeprincipals Kennedy. Hoover. and King are here to clear it up. but this account is as near firsthand as Is available and I hope it will make a positive contribution toward the discussion. The relevant facts are as follows: First. Two persons who the FBI believed advocated violence and could be influenced by the Communist Party leadership. had Infiltrated and were among the dozens of persons In the leadership of the King movement. Second. Both Robert Kennedy and Hoover had no doubt whatever that King was adamantly opposed to the use of violence to overthrow the Government or for any other purposes. Third. The FBI and the Attorney General believed they had a responsibility to monitor the activities of the two King associates. Fourth. The purpose for the tap of telephones King used was not to hear what King had to say but to keep surveillance on those two associates who used the same telephones. and the FBI had no way of knowing when those two individals would use the telephones.. therefore. King conversations were taped in wvhich the FBI had no interest and would not have otherwise been tap~ped. Obviously. if they wanted to secure information on King from telephone taps. King would not have been told what telephones those Individuals had access to and calls by them to any telephone might be tapped. Fifth. The FBI and Robert Kennedy believed the safety of King and possibly hundreds or thousands of other citizens was also involved. Sixth. The wiretaps were authorized In writing by the Attorney General only after King was fully informed that it would be done and why. Seventh. Kings economic theories were in no way involved in the decision to tap the telephones used and calls made by the two associates. Eighth. Anything that is on those tapes. King knew or should have known might be recorded. but would be Immaterial anyway to matters concerning King which are under consideration in 1983. Ninth. It was not a crime to associate with a Communist or to hold any economic theories one wanted to. Finding and monitoring those persons who advocated violence against the Government or conspired against the rights of citizens to have an participate in such Government was the sole objective for the taps and both Hoover and Kennedy were sure King was guilty of neither. Tenth. Conversations in which King was a participant and in which one of the two Individuals were not a participant were byproducts of a tap made for another purpose. The contents of Kings conversations were not material to the purpose for the taps then and they are irrelevant to the issues concerning King which are before us today. It Is easy for people 20 years later to say Robert Kennedy should not have authorized the telephone tap and to say the taps were not necessary to help assure that a small group could not turn one of those mass demonstrations to violence. but in fact no one knows that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies under the direction of the Attorney General did riot prevent more violence or prevent physical harmi to citizens in the putstilt of their rights under the Constituition. and no one is in a position today to prove the evidence presented to Kennedy did niot warrant his decision to authorize the taps. In fact. King must not have disagreed with Kennedys conclusion to authorize the tap or he would have made public objections or taken some other protest action at the time. While it is too late to change those decisions made in 1963. the matter of what to do with the tapes is one which must still be resolved. A court has prohibited their release for another 44 years but a legal action now seeks their release and more such legal actions can be expected in the fututre. The purpose for which the tapes were made. no longer exists. Whether they are released now or 44 years from nowv should not be the question and the truth or falsity of the stories relating to Kings personal life or economic beliefs which were allegedly revealed on the tapes are wholly immaterial. I believe those tapes containing irrelevant personal conversations by King should be destroyed. and I personally believe a policy should be established of Immediately destroying all tapes of conversations with no probative or continuing value in law enforcement obtained from taps which would not have been obtained except as a byproduct of a tapping for an authorized purpose. I think we should end the argument over when these Irrelevant King tapes with persons other than those two Individuals will be released by ordering their destruction now. Whatever is on those tapes Is no ones business other than the deceased who Is not here to protect himself and hie should not need to anyway. Any discussion of allegations relatlog to either King or Hoover only serves to divert attention from tih central relevant facts. Likewise. any allegation that Kennedy authorized the wiretap because hie thought King was a Communist sympathizer is not only false but only serves to divert alention from the relevant Issues. The relevant fact is that King was the leader of a successful movement which resulted In this country making giant steps toward eliminating the gap between the( promises In the 14th amendment and its fulfillment for nmulionis of Americans and that hre was deitermined and dlid accomplish that objective by nonviolent means within the framework of the Constitution. [he telephone taps authorized by Kennedy were in no way for the purpose of frustraiting that goal. but were instead consistent with fulfilling that goal. Also. it is now clear that had that movement not adhered to Kings determination to uiae nonviolent means to accomplish the purpose. there would have been widespread violence and deaths and the cause would have failed. It is unfortunate that the principals are not here to personally keep the record straight but I hope revealing the relevant contents of that hearing at this time will make a contribution toward putting those matters in perspeetive. will help to counteract some of tle unjustified conclusions being repeated so often that they are smothering the material facts. and will help encourage t1e passage of a new law or guidelines concerning the disposition of tapes from telephone taps which no longer would serve the purpose for which they were obtained."
980131808,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I think thle Members might like to have a little history of thle EDA appropriation. I do not remember the exact amount. but as late as about 3 years ago. the gentleman from Minnesota will remember. they had a substantially larger amount. It has not been authorized. but unfortunately about half of this bill has not been authorized. We on the subcommittee do not like it. We would much rather work with authorized programs. As a matter of fact. the programs that we are appropriating for today should have been authorized a year ago in September. But. on the other hand. you cannot stop the whole government. especially when the majority wants these programs to continue. What happened was that last year there was approximately $200 million for the regular EDA program that had expired 2 years ago. Then we put In an additional $100 million in the jobs bill. so that they had a total In EDA of $300 million. In the continuing resolution that expires tomorrow night they are authorized to spend at the rate of $250 million. Upon looking at the whole program and upon talking to Members of the House on both sides of the aisle. we felt that under all the constraints we had. $240 million would be a proper level for this program in this bill. Personally I would rather have had more money than that. But that is what we arrived at. The administration did not request any money for this program. for SBA direct loans for Legal Services Corporation. and for a number of other programs. However. let inc point this out and It is important to those Members who are interested In budget levels and deficits. We have worked this bill down to where the administration now says If this bill passeswe have worked out a package here. it is rather fragile. I admitbut the admlnistration says that if this bill passes as it came back from the conference. they will sign the bill. So If $240 million is not over either the administrations budget or our budget at this particular time. we are in agreement. We have worked some other things out that got thle bill down to where we could accommodate this level. So I think that this is a good level. It satisfies to some extent anyway those who think that this. Is anl important program. I ask my colleagues to support the committee on this. Mr. Speaker. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota . D 1800
980203357,"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in opposition to 1he amendment. I could oppose this on the merits. I do not think it is necessary. That has been pretty well done. I would point this out. though: Who better could represent the individual segments in this country in our free society than people from those segments? When you go to a foreign country. they do not want to hear some bureaucrat tell them how the Republican Party works. I have been in politics all my life. and for the life of me I could not tell you how the Republican Party works. I do not know how they have hung together all this time. Who better explains it than somebody from within the Republican Party? Who better could tell them about the free labor movement than somebody from within the labor movement? We have kids in high school in this country who do not understand the importance of a free society and the difference between our Government and the kind of governments we have in other countries. We are belatedly spending a little bit of moneya little bit of moneyon what we call lawrelated education so we can get lawyers and judges and other people to go into the classroom and explain the difference between our Government and other governments. On the merits. there are a number of arguments to be made for this program. but I do not think it is necessary. After all. we heard all those arguments for 3 or 4 or 5 days just last year. We thought that was about enough debate in this Congress. We went up the hill and down the hill. and up the hill and down the hill. and so the authorization of $31.3 million for this program was passed. The administration requested an appropriation of $34.3 million. That was more than the authorization. but we recommended an appropriation at exactly the authorized level of $31.3 million. Now. it seems to me we have had enough debate. Those who lost are coming in now and saying. ""We want another chance at it."" but after all. in this same Congress. we authorized this program after days and hours and hours of deliberation. All the arguments we are hearing today were brought out. We approved an authorization for $31.3 million and that is the amount we are recommending be appropriated in this bill. So I ask my colleagues to defeat this amendment and approve this appropriation."
980243408,"Mr. Speaker. we bring back a conference report which involved 151 amendments. It is not easy at any time to agree to 151 amendments. but we have done so and I think it is a good bill and should be supported. The conference agreement calls for a total budget authority of $11.520.976.200. This is slightly under the maximum amount that the Senate would be permitted to provide in this bill under their budget resolution. Although that budget resolution has not been agreed upon by both Houses. they felt constrained to stay within that amount. I have not been officially notified of ""his. but as I understand it. anyway. if we stay within this amount it would not be vetoed. So I think that we have brought back as good a bill as we could under th.. circumstances. I want this bill to become law. It involves some 17 independent agencies. 3 departments of Government. the entire judiciary of the United States. and we need to have this bill enacted rather than putting all of these departments and agencies and the judiciary on a continuing resolution. This bill is $771.411.800 more than it was when it left the House. However. I would like to point out that most of this addition is caused by the fact that some programs were left out in the House bill. They were knocked out on points of order or just were not included in the bill. This is very difficult. when we have a number of agencies that have not been authorized on the House side and then we have to deal with them in the appropriations bill. We should not be put in this position. but we have been year after year after year. I would like to do anything that I can to encourage the authorizing committees to get the bills up and get them authorized so that we can deal with the money matters and also not have to be extending their authorizations. For example. we have a number of things in here like the Federal Trade Commission. That is an important independent agency that has not been authorized for over 2 years. The Economic Development Administration has not been authorized or reauthorized. Neither has the Legal Services Corporation. We need these authorizations. We have included some money for programs. I will just name five. that were not included in the bill as it left the House. These account for most of the addition over the House level. EDA. for example. is this bill for $228.500.000. It was not in the House passed bill. Legal Services Corporation is $305 million. Additions to the prison system are $13.6 million. The Federal Trade Commission Is $64.3 million and the National Endowment for Democracy is $18.5 million. That makes up most of the additions over the House level. Also. this bill is $390.033.200 over the amount requested by the administration. but I would like to point out that we have added substantially more than that for programs the administration wanted. to zero out that neither the House nor the Senate wants to zero out. I will list for my colleagues a few of those. The Economic Development Administration is in this bill for $200 million for grants. The other $28.5 million in the bill is for salaries and expenses. The Legal Services Corporation is $305 million. Juvenile Justice Assistance. a very important program is $70.3 million. The Sea Grant Program is in here for $39 million. and coastal zone management for $34 million. Trade adjustment assistance. which is very important to some areas of the country where they have had difficulty as a result of the recession and imports. is $25 million. Public telecommunications grants is at $24 million and the U.S. Trustees Program is at $9.4 million. All of those things were left out of the administrations budget. and we were able to accommodate all of those by reducing a large number of items that were in the administrations budget. and shifting the money around. So I think that we have ended up here with a very. very good bill under the circumstances. and I am asking for its support."
980251250,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. and I commend the committee not only for making this access to justice law permanent but also for substantially improving the legislation. I want to point out a couple of things. For one thing. it was never intended by those of us who were the original authors of this hill in 1980 that the reimbursement would be limited to those cases where a U.S. attorney confirms the agency action. That was never intended. but that is the way it was ruled in at least one of the circuits. and that has been cured in this bill. I do want to point out a couple of things. though. that I hope in conference the gentleman from Wisconsin and the gentleman from Ohio will favorably consider. In the Senate bill. they include the IRS. Now. I know the Judiciary Committee had Jurisdictional problems here. but in the Senate bill. they include the IRS as an agency which must reimburse people in certain cases. and in our hearings. we found that there were substantial ntmbers of cases where there are arbitrary actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service. I hope that when you come back with the final bill. the IRS will be included. Another thing that I want to point out is that in the Senate bill. an agency required to pay the expenses to defend against an action which should not have been taken. shall be required to take out of their salaries and expenses account whatever it is determined should be reimbursed. By doing this. it keeps the pressure on the agency not to be arbitrary or take actions not substantially justified. That is in the Senate bill and if this is done. I think there will be a zero cost. The administratfon estimated the cost at $100 million. Well. at that time. they were asking for separate appropriations. The last thing we want to do is to give an agency a separate appropriation so that they can pay for whatever they did wrong. If we make them take such a cost out of their salaries and expenses account. then they will not have so many of these arbtrary decisions. So I want to commend the gentleman for this bill aid also for the other bills. There are a whole series of bills here on the floor today. all of which have been revealed as needed in hearings before the subcommittee that I am privileged to chair. One of the bills handled by the gentleman for New Jersey and the gentleman from Michigan
980277012,Mr. Chairman. I want to follow up on what the gentleman from Michigan said. First of all I would point out that the $110 million that the administration requested for the purpose of enhancing security at U.S. Embassies overseas is in this bill in the full amount that was requested. Some of you also were interested in some Small Business Administration disaster loan program amendments. They are in the bill. Also some changes in the pollution control guarantee program of the Small Business Administration are in this bill. On the crime bill I want to say this: It is not the same as the bills that were passed by either the House or the Senate. However. as the gentleman from Michigan said. the bill is the biggest crime bill ever passed in history. I want to point out Just how big It is. In this bill there are 771 pages. of which 635 pages deal with the crime bill. As a matter of fact. the crime package is 85 percent of the bill. and a realtively small part of the bill deals with money. This is an authorizing bill and the money portion is just tagging along on the crime bill. that is what it really amounts to. Since the crime package was in both the House and the Senate bill although with differences on some provisions. I. as chairman of the subcommittee handling the funding for the Department of Justice. was primarily responsible on the House side for trying to negotiate a compromise on this matter. We asked the members of the Committee on the Judiciary to come to the conference. They did come to the conference and sat down there and did in 2 hours what in a normal conference might have taken 2 or 3 days. I also want to commend the gentleman from New Jersey . the chairman of the committee. the gentleman who was mentioned previously. Mr. HUGHES. and Mr. SAWYER and others who worked so hard and hammered out the crime bill. Because the conference agreement on the crime bill is so comprehensive. I thought I should briefly review the items that are in it. The crime bill package includes provisions on ball reform. it also narrows the insanity defense. shifting the burden of proof to the defendant. it reforms Federal criminal sentencing procedures. it abolishes parole. it authorizes appeal of sentences by prosecution and defendant. and it includes improvements in forfeiture provisions in drug cases. The crime package also provides authorization for Federal funds to carry out specific anticrime programs. I might say that the House had previously appropriated money in the fiscal year 1985 Appropriation Act for the Department of Justice. anticipating that this authorization would be enacted. The crime package also Includes provisions to strengthen moneylaundering penalties. it creates national Drug Law Enforcement Policy toard to coordinate drug enforcement. it improves the witness protection program. it provides for Federal aid !or helping victims of crime: it provides for strengthening laws against counterfeiting of trademarked products. it improves the Federal ability to prevent diversion of dangerous prescription drugs. and it provides for Federal penalties for counterfeiting credit cards and for computer fraud and abuse. It also contains an antiterrorism act. It provides enhanced penalties for career criminals possessing a firearm. It also provides for the reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Program and establishes an office to address the missing children problem. We had previously appropriated the money to cover these programs. including missing children. in the fiscal year 1985 Appropriation Act for the Department of Justice. anticipating that this authorization would be enacted. The crime package also provides for a mandatory 5year prison term that must be imposed for the use of a firearm in the commission of a Federal crime. These are just sone of the provisions in this bill. I want to say again. Mr. Speaker. this is a very important crime bill. It should not be overlooked as a part of this continuing resolution.

980022414,"Mr. President. I am pleased to reintroduce along with Senators DURENBERGER. HATFIELD and HART. The Economic Equity Act of Two years ago. the Economic Equity Act was introduced by a bipartisan coalition of 26 Senators. Parallel legislation in the House drew more than 100 cosponsors. and the Equity Act proved to be the bellwether legislation on equal economic rights for men and women in the 97th Congress. The bill drew editorial endorsement from dozens of newspapers across the Nation and from virtually all of the organizations advocating equal economic rights for women. Four parts of that bill became law. namely. equal access to agricultural credit. child and dependent care reform. repeal of the ""widows"" estate tax and military and foreign service- pension reform. Significantly. S. 888 focused public attention on the concept of ""economic equity."" a phrase that now echoes from the pages of individual commentators to the state of the Union address of the President of the United States. The Economic Equity Act of 1983 reembraces measures that did not become law during the 97th Congress. and addresses several new issues of importance to the women of our Nation. The Economic Equity Act proposes solutions to some of the foremost inequities in our system today. Although the issues selected are not inclusive of all necessary changes. the women of the United States deserve immediate correction of. at least. these. Let me highlight several: First. women in the work force do not receive equal treatment under current pension laws. The Economic Equity Act seeks to reform both private and public pension laws by establishing pensions as a legitimate property right. by requiring written consent of the spouse before the retiree can waive survivors benefits. and by modifying breakinservice rules to give 20 hours per week credit for up to 1 year of employerapproved maternity or paternity leave. provided that the worker returns to his or her job. Those women who choose to remain at home. with no outside income. have no mechanism under current law to provide for their own retirement. This bill proposes to recognize alimony and child support payments as earned income. so that these women may establish an individual retirement account in their own right. Second. over the past generation. insurance companies have increasingly relied on gender to impose higher rates or lower benefits to women. The Economic Equity Act will prohibit discrimination in insurance on the basis of sex. Third. workingwomen with young children need financial help to offset the enormous costs of day care relative to their salaries. This bill Increases the dependent care tax credit to 50 percent. and makes the dependent care credit refundable for those whose income is so low that they lack sufficient tax liability to benefit from the existing credit. Fourth. displaced homemakers. who have lost their source of support through separation. divorce. death or disability of their spouses. need financial stability and marketable skills. The Equity Act will add displaced homemakers to the list of eligible hirees under the targeted jobs tax credit to employers. Fifth. 90 percent of all single parent families in the United States are headed by women. Women heads of households have the burden of maintaining a home and caring for dependents without the advantage of two wage earning adults. The Economic Equity Act proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code so that the zero bracket amount for heads of households is equal to that of married couples filing jointly. Sixth. child support enforcement is also a critical economic issue to women who head single parent families. Between onequarter and onethird of divorced or estranged fathers never made a single courtordered child support payment. The Economic Equity Act will encourage broader and stricter child support laws: specifically. securing child support for nonAFDC cases as well as for AFDC cases. The Economic Equity Act recognizes that there has been a revolution in the status of women in the United States. Out of the nearly 50 million women active in the labor force. many will not go homepermanentlyagain. Mr. President. my cosponsors and I seek to insure that the Economic Equity Act of 1983 is the bellwether legislation on equal rights in the 98th Congress. We join with our supporters in asking that Congress make these proposals a reality for the women of our Nation."
980057771,Mr. President. I am pleased that the Senate will consider this bill and three others that will. for the first time. provide active and comprehensive authorization of the activities of the fNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These four new authorization bills. S. 1097. S. 1098. S. 1099. and S. 1100 cover programs within all four of the NOAA budget areas. The four bills are: S. 1097A bill to consolidate and authorize certain atmospheric and satellite programs and functions. S. 1098A bill to consolidate and authorize certain ocean and coastal programs and functions. S. 1099A bill to consolidate and authorize certain marine fishery programs and functions. S. 1100A bill to consolidate and authorize program support and certain ocean and coastal programs and functions. These bills. combined with the other NOAA authorization legislation already on the books. brings 100 percent of the NOAA budget within the annual reauthorization and oversight process. This is a step which is long overdue since NOAA has now existed for over 13 years without a comprehensive system for congressional review of its activities. NOAA was originally established by Executive order in 1970 to consolidate Federal ocean and atmospheric activities. At that time these activities were scattered throughout a variety of Federal agencies. The need for a unified approach to the exploration and development of the oceans and atmosphere was recognized then. as it is now. as being essential to the maintenance and enhancement of the quality of our lives. The scope of NOAAs responsibilities has also increased considerably since its formation in 1970. Since its establishment. NOAA has developed into a worldwide leader in ocean and atmospheric research and services. The functions of NOAA are critical for the efficient shortterm and longterm forecasting of weather and the sound and productive management of the Nations ocean and coastal resources. Not only does NOAA serve our national interests. but it provides essential data and services to other nations which assist in the protection of lives and property. The status of NOAA as a worldwide leader in ocean and atmospheric research must be maintained to insure the continued safety and productivity of our Nation. Thus. it is in the national interest to take whatever steps are necessary to reinforce both NOAAs mission and its ability to carry out that mission. However. maintaining the leadership status of NOAA has been more difficult in recent years. Budgetary pressure. as well as the proposed termination of certain programs. have confronted the agency during the past 3 years. This situation has threatened the viability of NOAA as an agency. The reaction of Congress to these threats to NOAA has been to strongly support as least level funding for most NOAA programs. This support is a natural outgrowth of the national concern about the everincreasing demands on our valuable oceanic and atmospheric resources. Congress feels that NOAA must be given the means to actively respond to this national concern. The four bills that we are considering today recognize the importance of maintaining a strong national ocean and atmospheric program and provide the necessary authorization of funds for its administration. The Commerce Committee demonstrated its firm support for this comprehensive authorization plan when it unanimously voted to report these four bills on April 21. There is another important point which I should make at this time. It is my feeling that a comprehensive authorization for NOAA lays a foundation for the establishment of NOAA as as independent agency within the Federal branch. Such a move has already been endorsed by the Reagan administration as part of a June 1. 1983. announcement. There is also widespread support for such an action within Congress and the ocean and atmospheric communities. By consolidating the legislative and appropriation authority for NOAA we are taking the first step toward the ultimate goal of transferring NOAA from the Commerce Department to a new. much deserved status as an independent organization. Such a transfer will. in my view. serve to bolster the mission and the effectiveness of NOAA. For all these reasons. I urge Senators to join me in demonstrating Senate support for NOAA by voting in favor of 5. 1097. S. 1098. S. 1099. and 5. 1100.
980073059,Mr. President. I am today asking for Senate passage of Senate Resolution 174. a resolution regarding commercial whaling. A great many of my colleagues and I have been working on this issue for many years. A major victory was won last year at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission when that body voted to impose a moratorium on commercial whaling. This moratorium is set to begin in late Unfortunately. four nations filed objections to the moratorium decision. an action which threatens the effectiveness of the decision. Those four nations are Japan. Norway. Peru. and the Soviet Union. It is important that we let these nations know that the resolve of the United States remains firm and that we are committed to seeing the moratorium through to its complete implementation. For this reason. I ask that the Senate act favorably on Senate Resolution 174. The resolution does not break any new ground on the whaling front. It simply reaffirms 12 years of U.S. support for a cessation of commercial whaling. It also calls on the Secretaries of State and Commerce to continue their diligent efforts to see that the moratorium is effectively implemented and observed. There are a variety of sanctions in U.S. law which are available to us if the moratorium is threatened. and it is my view that we should not hesitate to use these measures. This years International Whaling Commission meeting begins on Monday. July 18. in Brighton. England. It is my hope that the full Senate will agree to send a message that the United States has not altered its policy regarding a whaling moratorium. We should also be willing to make it clear to all IWC members that we intend to back up this policy with positive action if necessary. Let me also say that it is my sincere hope that such action will never be necessary. The ideal outcome on this issue would be for the nations Which have filed objections to realize that their best course lies in cooperating with the majority of nations who have decided that commercial whaling should cease. This issue continues to be a major irritant to relations between the United States and those nations which have filed objections. Given the economic insignificance of commercial whaling when compared to our other economic relations with those nations. it seems to me that it would be wise for them to accede to the will of the majority on this matter. I thank my colleagues for this opportunity and I ask for their support of Senate Resolution 174.o
980137384,Mr. President. today I am introducing the Residential Mortgage Investment Act of 1983. This bill seeks to broaden tile ability of private pension funds to invest in the residential mortgage market while Insuring that adequate safeguards governing the investments of these plans remain Intact. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. ERISA. governs private sector pension plan investment policies. Sections 404 through 408 establisi standards which were designed to encourage safe and sound investments yielding acceptable returns that are In the best interests of the plan participants. and protect pension plan participants from improper dealings by plan fiduciaries and other related parties. Two sets of investments constraints may affect a pension funds ability to Invest in residential mortgages. Thle first involves general investment responsibility rules which impose requirements of prudence. diversification. liquidity and prohibitions against selfdealing by plan fiduiciaries. These investment requiremenits apply to all investments whether they be stocks. bonds or mortgages and. therefore. do not place any specific restrictions on a pension funds ability to invest in the mortgage market. Thle second set of constraints contained in ERISA that greatly affect a pension funds ability to invest in mortgages are the prohibited transactions provisions. The congressional assumption behind the adoption of these provisions was that dealings between pension funds and related parties are inherently subject to abuse. Because it is difficult to police these kinds of transactions. Congress enacted a general prohibition on all dealings between funds and related parties. Unlike most investment transactions. mortgage transactions usually involve a large number of parties including not only employers and employees. but also builders. developers. unions. mortgage bankers. and other types of financial institutions. Because of tile large numbers-.of partiesinInterest typically involved In mortgage transactions. a mortgage Investment is more likely to be classified as a prohibited transaction than other types of investments. Plan trustees are inhibited from engaging in such transactions because there is a significant risk that they might inadvertently engage in a prohibited transaction. For all practical purposes. the prohibitcd transaction provisions of ERISA preclude plan Investments in mortgages. even if the transactions are prudent. fair. and at arms length. In June 1980 the National Association of Home Builders and thc Nlational Coordinating Committee on Multiemployer Plans asked the Department of Labor to Issue an administrative exemption that would permit pension plans to invest in residential mortgages under certain conditions. After almost 2 years. the Department issued final prohibited transactions exemptions. However. these exemptions did not sufficiently authorize plan trustees to make mortgage investments. The Residential Mortgage Investment Act of 1983 is designed to remove thle unnecessary barriers that have discouroged private pension funds from investing In housing. The bill amends ERISA to allow any qualified mortgage transaction by an employee benefit plan provided the transaction receives the prior approval of an independent fiduciary. is eligible for purchase by. or backed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). the Federal home Loan Mortgage Association (FHLMC) or the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).. or Involves mortgagebacked securities bearing one of the three highest ratings of a nationally recognized rating service. This bill accomplishes two Important goals. First. it places residential mortgages on equal footing with other investment opportunities. It does not mandate pension fund investment In mortgages. nor does it give preferential treatment to mortgages. It simply removes the secondclass investment status that has been assigned to mortgages. Second. At Insures that adequate Investment safeguards are maintained to protect pension plan participants. By retaining the prudence rule and the selfdealing provision of ERISA. this bill insures that Investments in residential mortgages will be made under the same conservative standards as all other plan investments and that plan trustees will not be able to engage in mortgage transactions for their own benefit. Some concern has been voiced about the effect of this bill on the tax treatment of loans to plan participants. I would like to clarify at this point that the Residential Mortgage Investment Act does not attempt to alter the tax treatment of the transactions covered by the bill. Mr. President. this bill Is the result of many months of negotiations between the the National Asssociation of Home Builders and the Building and Construction Trades Department of the AFLCIO. I am pleased to say the bill I am introducting today has the endorsement of both of these groups. I ask unanimous consent that the letters from the Home Builders and from the building trades supporting this bill be Inserted in the RECORID at this point.
980176059,Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce a bill to provide for authorization of several important programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): deep seabed mining. nonliving marine resources. the sea grant program. the ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) program and the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere (NACOA). NOAA was created by Executive order in 1970 with the primary responsibility for most of the Federal Governments civilian research. service and regulatory programs affecting the Nations oceans and atmosphere. The functions of NOAA are critical for the sound and productive management of the Nations ocean and coastal resources. This bill is one of a series which together provide a comprehensive authorization for NOAA. Included in this bill are authorizations for deep seabed mining and programs concerning nonliving marine resources. Hard mineral resources in the ocean represent a source of supply in addition to that on land. It is likely that these resources will eventually be used to supplement domestic and foreign supplies during approaching decades. The technology for mining and processing these minerals has advanced to the point where mining companies in the United States and other nations are on the verge of commercial exploitation. Manganese nodules and polymetailic sulfide deposits. if commercially developed. would reduce dependence on potentially unstable foreign supplies of strategic minerals. improve the balance of payments. provide new employment opportunities in the private sector. and help maintain U.S. leadership in ocean technologies. NOAAs sea grant program is directed toward developing and protecting the Nations marine resources through the application of academic expertise in coordinated research. education. and advisory service programs designed to meet national. regional. and local needs. Sep. grants excellent research program has accelerated growth of marine industries. such as aquaculture and ocean engineering. through the development of new technologies and the effective application of research by governmental. industrial. and private uses. Sea grants training program continues to produce the specialized personnel needed to develop and manage our Nations marine resources. In the 8 years of Its existence. sea :grant has more than justified continued support of its successful programs and I am pleased to include its reauthorization in this bill. Also Included in this bill is the reauthorization of NOAAs ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) program. This program provides a framework for the licensing and commercial use of technology to generate electricity from the temperature difference be. tween warm water at the oceans surface and the colder underlying waters. Utilization of this energy resource would help reduce dependence of foreign sources of oil by providing an alternate and renewable supply of electrical energy.. A filial section of this bill provides for the reauthorization of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere (NACOA). NACOA. comprised of individuals having expertise in oceanic and atmospheric affairs. reviews the Nations marine policies and programs and reports to the President and the Congress. In the past. NACOA has provided useful advice to Congress and demonstrated the value of its services. In conclusion. the bill which I am introducing today provides authorization for a number of important and costeffective programs of NOAA. and I ask my colleagues for their support.e By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself and Mr. LAUTENBERG):
980179810,Mr. President. it is with some reluctance that I speak against this as I was an original cosponsor of this amendment in 1978 in the Senate. and with all credit to Senator Cohen. who was the original sponsor of this amendment in the House of Representatives. at some stage you reexamine amendments and you decide whether or not there is justification in keeping them. whether or not you can afford it at a time of immense deficits. and I know everything has to be balanced against everything else. These particular credits were considered in tandem with solar. wind. geothermal credits. aAd we tried to compare whether or not all of the credits. whether they were the conservation credits or whether they were solar. wind. and geothermal credits. whether they worked to achieve the purpose because there is only one purpose for the cdedits. and that is to encourage people to do things that they would not otherwise do but for the credit. With solar energy and especially with solar energy for hot water heat. it was very clear because it was expensive enough that people would not install solar energy panels without the credit or. to put it the other way around. the credit was a tremendous inducement. When we tried to find evidence as to whether or not the 15 percent energy tax credit for the followinginsulation. weatherstripping. caulking. automatic setbacks. thermostats. and storm windows and doorswas the tipping point that with energy prices going up people still would not invest in those conservation devices without the credit. we could find no evidence that that was the reason that they made the investment. So we tried to save about $400 million. and that is what this would cost if we continue it through 1985. because the tax credit does not end in 1985. You take it off your income tax the following year. So any investments that are made through 1985. you can deduct in ensuing years. about $400 million. And we looked again. and we said because of $400 million. are we inducing people to invest in things they would not otherwise invest in but for the credit. and I am not saying the answer was no. All I am saying is there was no evidence that that is why they did it. as apposed to very clear evidence. very clear evidence. in the area of solar especially. in the area of wind and geothermal only to a lesser degree. because much less is done in that area than is done in solar. the credits worked. So it is. for that reason that I now stand in opposition to these credits. having been an original sponsor. having supported them. liking to think that I would be willing in almost any area of conservation and environment. to use credits for legitimate purposes. It is simply Lhmt in this area we could find no evidence that the credits indeed Induced the action that we hoped would be undertaken. or. in conclusion. to put it the other way around. energy prices had risen high enough that people were going to undertake this action with or without the credits. and in that case there is no use in the Federal Government losing about $400 million to encourage people to do things that they are going to do in any event.
980222880,"Mr. President. today the Senate is acting on a bill. S. 2463. which provides a 1year reauthorization of a number of programs carried out by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The bill provides a total of $75.000.000 for the National Marine Fisheries Service to carry out a portion of its duties in the areas of information collection and analysis and State and industry assistance programs. Also. funding is included for Fishery Conservation and Management Programs such as hatchery operations and habitat conservation. The balance of the funding needed by the Fisheries Services to carry out these functions is authorized under several cyclical authorizations. the primary one being the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The bill also includes a 3year reauthorization of the Fishermens Guaranty Fund. This fund is used to make payments to fishermen who suffer losses as a result of seizure of their vessels by foreign nations which make jurisdictional claims not recognized by the United States. Also. the bill extends several provisions of law relating to the Fisheries Loan Fund. The bill extends the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to deposit foreign fishing fees into the fisheries loan fund and allows the Secretary of Commerce to continue making loans from the Fisherles Loan Fund to fishermen to avoid default on Federal loan guarantees. The bill also authorizes funds for the Secretary of Commerce to use volunteers to assist in programs conducted by NOAA. The Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act of 1980 is reauthorized for 2 years at $1.5 million in each fiscal year. The bill contains several amendments to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act [MFCMA] designed to restate U.S. policy that foreign nations fishing in the U.S. 200mile zone are given allocation in return for their cooperation in helping to develop the U.S. fishing industry. These amendments to the MFCMA explicitly state that purchases of U.S. processed fishery products. and not just fish. are expected in return for allocations. Also. the chances clarify that there is no doubt that allocations to a foreign nation occur only when we are satisfied with that foreign nations arrangements to purchase U.S. fish and fish products. A full allocation of the total allowable level of foreign fishing [TALFF] is not required by law. Finally. these amendments sharpen the focus of the ""fish and chips"" policy incorporated into the MFCMA to require an evaluation of what the foreign nation seeking an allocation is doing for U.S. industry in the specific fishery for which an allocation is being requested. To receive an allocation for a specific species. a nation must demonstrate what it is doing to open its market to U.S. industry exports of that particular species. Finally. S. 2463 contains a 2year authorization of the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 for fiscal years 1984 and 1985."
980226922,Mr. President.. I ask my colleagues today t.o consider H.R. 4997. a bill to authorize appropriations for the Marine Mammal Protect ion Act of 1972 for fiscal years 1985. 1986. 1987. and 19118. The bill provides authorization of funds to the Department of Commerce. the Department. of the interior. and the Marine Mammal Commission to enable these agencies to carry out. their responsibilIties as mandated by the Marine Manmal Projection Act. In addition. II.R. 4997 Includes a number of amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act that reflect the views of the administration. the conservation community. and the fishing industry. Because the extensive amendments made to the act during the 1981 reauthorization have worked well. major changes are not necessary at this time. The amendments contained in II.R. 4997 that I will outline augment the efficient implementation of the acts goals. First. II.R. 4997 clarifies that potential nominees to the Marine Mammal Commission must be the unanlilotis choices of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. the Director of the National Science Foundation. and the Chairman of tile National Academy of Sciences. This will ensure that the President is choosing from the best possible nominees. Second. this bill extends. in its entirety. the existing marine mammal permit turrently held by the American Tunaboat Association. Thls means the the tuna Industry must continue to abide by the quotas for Incidental porpoise kills. This level Is currently set at 20.500 per year. and Is a major improvement from the 400.000 per year which were killed in the early 1970s prior to enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Third. -I.R. 4997 requires foreign nations which export tuna to the United States to meet the same marine mammnnal protection standards that are inposed on the domestic fleet. Such a foriign nation must submit to the Secretary of Conmerce satisfactory docunentary evidence that it has adopted and enforces a le.a.lly binding regulatory programl governing the incidiital taking of marine iallmials by its inai vessels that is no less protective than the U.S. TunaPorpoise Program. This requirement ensures the equitable treatment of our domestic tuna fleet as compared to foreign fleets. Fourth. this legislation authorizes a new program of research to monitor the abundance and population trends of porpoise that are incidentally taken in the tuna fisheries. The hard data this study will provide is essential to determine whether porpoise stocks are increasing or decreasing. The research program authorized in II.R. 4997 will atlso investigate alternative fishing techniques that do not involve porpoise. The hope here is that by developing fishing techniques which do not involve the taking of porpoise. we will achieve the ultimate solution to the Iunaporpoise problem. 11.1.. 4997 also provides for congressional approval of several governing international fishery agreements (GIFAs). The GIFAs included in the bill are for the European Economic Community. the Soviet Union. and Poland. Without such an agreement in force. no nation may fish within the 200mile fishery conservation zone of the United States. Member countries of the EEC. as well as Poland. will conduct fihing operations within the FCZ this year. In the case of the Soviets. although they do not harvest fish within the FCZ. they are partners In several joint venture fishing operations in our waters. These joint ventures have proven quite profitable to our fishermen. and. therefore. it is in our best interest to extend the Soviet GIFA and thereby permit these busness relationships to continue. The bill also contains an authorization for a National Coastal Resources Research and Development Institute. The purpose of this Institute is to conduct research. education and demonstration projects to promote the growth of national and regional economies dependent upon coastal resources. The Institute will serve as the nexus of many research fields. interacting not just to conduct research but to bridge the gap between pure research and user groilps. This Interdisciplinary approach to solving problems unique to coastal states is sorely needed. A common problem shared among many coastal States. is the boombust cycle experienced in coastal econones. These States are often closely linked and dependent upon one or two industries such as fisheries. oil and gas development. or forestry. When events cause a mainstay industry to decline. the economic impact can be staggering. For this reason. the Institute will examine methods to enhance the economnic diversification of coastal States. The Institute will be administered by a board of governors representing the pacific rim States. and projects to be undertaken will be suggested by an advisory board of nationally renowned figures in the sciences. This is a unique approach to address unique problems common to many coastal States. Another provision of the bill deals with the Fishermens Protective Act. Included in this provision is a 3year reauthorization for section 7 of the act. Section 7 provides for a voluntary insurance program to compensate U.S. fishing vessel owners and crews who suffer financial losses resulting from the selzure of their vessels by foreign governments on the basis of Jurisdictional claims not recognized by the U.S. Government. The amendment consolidates in one department. the Department of State. administration of payments due a vessel owner in order to cover any fine or other direct charge paid in order to secure release of a vessel or crew. There are also changes made to clarify application of the act with respect to disputes as to material fact between a foreign nation and a seized U.S. vessel and actions taken by a foreign nation in seizing a U.S. vessel that are Inconsistent with recognized procedures under international law. This last change has been made necessary by disputes over what appear to be legitimate claims which the State Department is unable to pay because of the way the current statute is drafted. However. in making the change regarding factual disputes over claims. I want to make it clear that this new standard for reviewing evidence is not Intended to be viewed as a blank check for persons wishing to fish illegally in the waters of another country. We will be watching carefully to see what effect this new standard will have on the number and type of claims. If it appears that the new standard is being misused. steps will be taken to change it. The bill also contains language dealing with fishing vessel manning and safety requirements. This language has been worked out after many months of negotiation and I feel it reflects a reasonable compromise on the issue. Basically. the changes being proposed would establish a set of permanent safety. inspection. and manning requirements for the U.S. fishing industry. I believe the standards which have been worked out for harvesting. processing. and combination vessels represent a sound compromise between the original Senate and House poshiions on this issue. I would like to commend Congressman JoHN BREAUX and his staff in particular for their assistance In working out this package. The new standards will enhance safety while providing the industry with the ability to plan for the future with the confidence of knowing that these vessel requircmeuts have been permanently set. The last point I would like to make is about a provision which is not in the bill. I had proposed a change in the PackwoodMagnuson amendment to the Manguson Fishbry Conservation and Management Act regarding the moratorium on commercial whaling which has been agreed to by the International Whaling Commission. Unfortunately. the Japanese Government chose to raise strenuous objections to my suggestion that any nation which violates the IWC moratorium be automatically certified under the PackwoodMagnuson amendment. Their opposition has resulted in this provision being deleted from the bill. much to my dismay. I am disappointed that the Japanese decided to fight so hard against a provision which supports U.S. policy on whaling and which is nothing more than a statutory recognition of the inevitable. There is no one that I am aware of. including members of the Japanese whaling industry. who doubt the inevitability of certification should a nation choose to ignore the IWC moratorium and continue whaling Into Let me use this opportunity to again commit myself to the full and effective implementation of the whaling moratorium. and to say that- I will continue to pursue this proposed change in the PackwoodMagnuson amendment.
980254178,"Mr. President. I have had numerous calls today as to whether or not it was the intention of the sponsors of the Civil Rights Act of 1984 to offer it to the trade bill. Needless to say. my good friend from Missouri. Senator DANFORTH. has talked with me about this and said. ""Please. please. not on my bill."" The problem is there are only two. three or four bills remaining to which this bill can be offered for debate. and all of those bills are supported by close friends of mine who say. ""Please. not on this bill."" I say to my colleagues that it has to be on some bill. and this issue is going .to be debated before we are done with this session. whether It is on this bill or the highway bill or some other bill that may come alonq in the next day or two. or hopefully not the debt ceiling. but at some stage in the proceedings. Right now negotiations are going on between the administration and representatives of the leadership conference on civil rights in the hope that an agreed compromise can be reached. September 17. 1.984 September.17. 1984 As I am talking today that compromise has not as yet been reached. although there are only one or two points of major difference between the parties. and I think they are all negotiating In good faith. Whether or not a compromise will be reached I cannot say. and that is the reason I am at least putting the Senate on notice that it will be the intention of the principal sponsors of this bill to add it to some bill starting tomorrow. The reason I say tomorrow is that the other principal cosponsor on the Democratic side. Senator KENNEDY. is in Massachusetts. It is their primary tomorrow. He will be voting tomorrow morning and then will be returning to the Senate at midday. And from midday forth I hope the Senate would be on notice that on some bill and possibly this bill. if it is still the pending business. we will offer the Civil Rights Act of 1984. We will be proposing a package that will address the much exaggerated criticism that this bill is overly broad. That package will insure that the intentions are met which is nothing more than return the law to the State in which it existed prior to the Grove City case. To that end. the package will simply strike the terms ""program or activity"" from each of the statutes involved. and those are the words that the Supreme Court interpreted so narrowly. and instead we will substitute the word ""recipient"" for those words. but delete from our definition of recipient as it currently exists in the statutory language as originally proposed by the sponsors of this bill. Instead we would insert a grandfather clause grandfathering the applicable law and regulations on the day before Grove City was decided. I would hope that this would remove all criticism regarding the content of the definition and its: breadth regarding any new or different recipients of financial assistance. Let me say once more to my colleagues I have no desire to cloud the future of the trade bill or the highway bill or any of the other very meritorious bill that may be brought before the Senate in the next 3 weeks. But more important than any of those bills are the rights of all American citizens in how the Federal Government is going to act to protect those rights. The Supreme Court in the Grove City case made an interpretation very narrowly defining the words ""program or activity."" It was a definition that surprised most. not all. but most people who have dealth with title 9. which is the title that the Grove City case was involved with. or other civil rights statutes. Almost all of the previous Attorneys General. almost all of the previous Assistant Attorneys General in charge of the Civil Rights Division. Republican or Democratic. have assumed that the words ""program or activity"" meant something more than just a specific program or activity. That assumed that it meant as far as education is concerned that if your English department received a Federal grant your athletic department could not discriminate against women whether or not it received a Federal grant. It turns out that the Supreme Court has said no. program or activity. means specific program or activity. so that if your English department gets a Federal grant. you are still free to discriminate against women in the French department or the athletic department. And we are already seeing a decision by the Department of Justice to withdraw further investigations in a number of potential suits. In addition. all of the other fundamental civil rights statutes of this country. the 1964 Civil Rights Act. the act relating to the handicapped. the act relating to older Americans. all used the words ""program or activity."" and the administration indicated after the Grove City case that they intended to enforce the other civil rights statutes in conformance with the Supreme Court decision in Grove City. meaning that henceforth they would be enforced on what is called a program specific or very narrow basis. Mr. President. I indicated that almost all of the previous Attorneys General and the Assistant Attorneys General in charge of the Civil Rights Division. Republican and Democratic. thought the term ""program or activity"" should be interpreted more broadly than the Court interpreted them in Grove City. Clearly there were some who did not think the interpretation would be that broad or you never would have had the case brought at all or the administration joining in the brief in the suit. I emphasize once more what our amendment will be when we offer it so that no one is unaware. The package will strike the terms ""program or activity"" from each of the four statutes and substitute ""recipient"" for those words. But we will delete our definition of recipient from our statutory language as originally proposed and instead insert a grandfather clause. grandfathering the applicable law and regulations on the day before Grove City was decided. In a nutshell. Mr. President. that means as follows: . One. we will reverse Grove City and return to what everyone thought was the law prior to Grove City. namely. institutional wide coverage. Two. we will leave every litigant and every program other than education. which we are changing statutorily. in exactly the same situation it was prior to the day that Grove City was decided. and we will statutorily adopt the definition of recipient as it existed In the law and regulations on that date. Hopefully that means that the law will be exactly where it was prior to the date the Grove City case was decided. That means that if you were covered under the civil rights statutes of this country prior to Grove City. you Will be covered after these amendments are adopted. If you were not covered under the civil rights statutes of this country prior to Grove City. you will not be covered. and if the law was murky. If there was litigation. if there was a question as to whether or not you were covered under the old statutes that will remain because we are not attempting with the Civil Rights Act of 1984 to do anything other than return the status of the law. clear or murky. to what it was prior to Grove City. Once more. let me apologizealthough I do not feel any apology is necessary for fighting for the civil rights of the citizens of this countrylet me apologize to whichever of my friends bills this amendment happens to be attached to. I mean you no harm or violene. not do I mean to do in your bill. But if I were to wait until the appropriate vehicleand I put that term in quotesthe appropriate vehicle comes along. there is not a single Member in this Senate who wants his or her piece of legislation cluttered up. We have heard the argument before: ""All I want is a clean bill."" whether it is a tax bill or debt ceiling or whether it is a continuing resolution. Every chairman and every Member handling the bill wants a clean bill. Would that we could have that. But I now see. with the 2 weeks remaining3 weeks. but with 2 weeks of practical legislation leftno alternative but to offer it to some bill that brill be on this floor. And everyone should be on notice that from about noon on tomorrow any bill could be the vehicle to which we attach the Civil Rights Act of 1984."
980261858,"Mr. President. today. Senialtor KFNNEDY. mySelf Rad 61 other S1nators bring to the Senate floor as an amendment. to the continuIng resolution. the most significant piece of leg!slation of t le 9111 Congrss. The Civil Hights Act of 19114 is a simple bill. Yet. without its p)u.sage. millions of Americans will be deprived of fundamenatal civil rights. rhe Senate consideration of the Civil Rights Act of 1984 has been vxtensive and intense at the committee level for the past 6 months. Additionally. maiiy of my colleagues have no doubt heard of our exhaustive negot iations with the administration and may be confused by tile intensity of conroversy over this bill. No doubt your are as incredulous as I have been. beeause this Is not a radical bill. This is not new civil rights law. This is not an expansion of rights for anyone. This bill is simply a restoration of what we thought the law has been all along. The Civil Rights Act of 1984 is a respionse. and a response alone. to the February decision of the Supreme Court in Grove City College agaiinist Bell. In that decision. the Court. interpireted litle IX of tihe Edueation Amendments of 1972. prohibiting sex discrimination in education. extrmenly narrowly. and in a mnnner contrary to the past 12 years of interpretation by both Deiocratic and Republican administrations. It was a technical dccislon. and one readily corrected by Congrss. What the Suprene Court said is that only tii(h specilic. ""program or activity"" ii an education institution reciving Federal funds need comply with title IX. Up until that point.. buti courts and prior administrations have interpreted title IX and the civil rights statutes upon which it is iimodeled as conveying. ""institutionwide"" coverae. Inst it tit lonwide coverage mreans. if Federal imoicys are received. discritulnation is piohibited in all portions of the institution. By the Civil Rights Act of 1984. all we seek to do is return the law to the place it was prior to Grove City. li doing so. it is our judgment that we must also ariend title VI of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. seetion 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. all of which employ identical language. We are concerned that courts will feel bound by the Grove City decision to interpret those other bLatutes in the same restrictive fashion. The Department of Justice has already indicated its intention to proceed on this basisand investigations have been stopped in at least 23 cases. The rights of minorities. our disabled. our elderly. as well as our women. are at stake. And we cannot permit any of these groups. or these rights. to be in jeopardy. You have heard horror story after horror story in the weeks since this bill was introduced. The opponents claim enactment of this bill will mean that farmers. grocery store owners. landlords that accept AFDC checks as rental payments. churches. will suddenly be covered by this bill. You have also heard that there will be virtually no private sphere in which the Federal Government cannot intrude. Every one of these stories is a myth. We will address each and every one of these claims in the succeeding debate and we will not yield until this bill becomes a reality for all Americans. The issue is discrimination: Will the Federal Government subsidize discrimination? And will the Senate permit that practice to occur? Let me remind all of you that in June. the House passed this bill overwhelmingly. 375 to 32. with but two amendments. both of which would expand the coverage of the bill. rather than restrict it. This vote followed 6 days of hearings in the House with a total of 34 witnesses on both sides. In the Senate. three different committees held 5 days of hear ings and have heard from 51 witnesses. including the testimony of representatives of administrations from President Nixon through President Carter. each of which urged passage of the civil rights bill. It is hard to imagine what arguments could be raised in counterpoint. It is hard to imagine what defense the opponents could urge. It is hard to conceive that anybody could seek. in 1984. to deprive so many of so much. Because. however. there has been so much misrepresentation. hyperbole. and hysteria. Senator KENNEDY and I have decided to offer a package of clarifying amendments to our original bill. This comports with our promise from the start to consider making changes that would complement our objective. to restore these statutes to their preGrove City stature. It also comports with our firm commitment not to undercut or substantially change these laws in any respect. To reassure any who may be confused and mystified by the barrage of claims of the proponents. our package drops the statutory definition of ""recipient"" that has engendered so much criticism. and substitutes. instead. a grandfather clause. The grandfather clause specifically states that nothing in this bill will alter the interpretation of ""recipient"" or the regulations in place the day before the Grove City decision was decided. The purpose of this change is to remove all doubt that the bill will result in an expansion of civil rights jurisdiction under the four statutes. Whoever is a recipient under the standards and criteria developed over the past 20 years continues to be a recipient. Whoever is not a recipient under those standards will not be. Ulitmate beneficiariessuch as farmers who receive Federal crop subsidieswill continue to be excluded as they always have been. Landlords. retailers. and banks which may receive proceeds from an AFDC. Social Security. or Federal pension check will continue to be excluded as they always have been. Drug stores and grocery stores will be covered only to the extent they have been covered before. Going further to meet the concerns that have been expressed. the substitute contains two other clarifications of the coverage of recipients under the broad principles established by Congress when it enacted these laws. First. witi respect to States and localities. the amendment makes clear that only departments and agencies which actually received Federal financial assistance or are primarily responsible for carrying out the functions for which the assistance was granted. are covered. For example. an education block grant will not trigger automatic coverage of a States transpcrtation department. Federal aid extended to a single State department will not trigger coverage of the entire State. Second. with respect to private business corporations with multiple establishments or plants. the substitute makes clear that only those establishments of the corporation that actually receive Federal financial assistance are covered. For example. if one plant of an auto company receives a Federal grant. another plant of the same company would not be covered unless it also received a grant. Finally. the substitute amendment ensures that the scope of the termination authority remains narrow and pinpointed to the discrimination which exists. For instance. discrimination in the English department at a college would not require termination of all Federal funds received by the college simply because Federal funds received by the college may have freed up other college funds to be used in the English department. What more can we do to satisfy the nay sayers? How much further can we go to remedy a technical problem? By contrast. the only amendments we have seen from opponents of the bill would substantially undercut the civil rights laws. exempting entirely new categories of recipients of Federal funds and providing special status for a privileged few. It is Senator KENNEDYS and my viewand for some time the view of the Congress of the United Statesthat no one should be permitted to discriminate in this country when the Federal Government is infusing those institutions with public funds. It is equally our view that when discrimination occurs. the victims should be able to seek relief In Federal court. What is horrifying. and repugnant. is that such simple premises require restatement and relitigation today. Let us not get caught up in rhetoric and forget fundamental philosophy regarding civil rights. Those who are against them will always be against them. Those who are for themwhich I strongly suspect is a vast majority of this Senate. including 62 cosponsors of this billwill not rest until this bill becomes law. It is not our intention to deprive the Senate of completing its business. We seek nothing more than speedy passage of this bill so that the 98th Congress can close with our most fundamental citizens rights restored. intact. and forever assured. Mr. President. I have ambivalent feelings about what we are doing here tonight. With all of my heart I support this civil rights bill. but I have trouble supporting this procedure that we are undertaking. It is not clear that we have the votes on my side and Senator KENNEDYS side to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1984 in this session. There is an honest difference of opinionand I emphasize an honest difference of opinionas to what the law was prior to the Grove City case. In good conscience Senator KENNEDY and I think It was one thing. while Senator HATcH and Senator HELMS think it was another. That is an honest difference of opinion. it is a subject worthy of debate on the floor of the Senate and is also a subject worthy of vote. But I am reminded of something that my predecessor in the Senate. Wayne Morse. used to say over and over and over: ""Give me control of the procedures of democracy. and I will control the substance."" Is this Civil Rights Act of 1984 germane to the socalled continuing resolution? As a matter of fact. I think it is. There is so much in that resolution. that there is nothing that is ungermane to the continuing resolution. I daresay that if we voted in honesty and we said: Is there something in the continuing resolution that bears on some amendment that somebody wants to offer? The answer would be. It is clearly germane. Is it legislating on an appropriation bill? Clearly. it is legislating on an appropriation bill. Would that bother me in and of itself? No. We do it all the time. Let me share with you something. Mr. President. Later today we are going to come to an amendment in the appropriation bill identified as section I. I cannot give you a page number of anything because we do not have the bill in front of us. What it does is incorporate by reference the entire S. 2852. which is a previous appropriation bill that has been reported out of committee and never voted upon by the Senate. I have marked it in yellow and given it to the Parliamentarian to tell me how much of it is legislating. His answer is that roughly 80 percent of it is legislating on an appropriation bill. The Appropriations Committee is legislating on appropriation bills. So by every fair stretch of the imagination. why should the rest of us not be allowed to legislate on appropriation bills? I will tell you what is going to happen. This Senate is one of the few bodies I have run across which is less than the sum of its parts. We have managed from roughly 1970 or 1971 onward to so pervert and torture the processes of this body that we are approaching being inert. The House of Representatives is barely better or worse. What we are going to succeed in doing is so immobilizing the legislative process that we are going to make the Executive not just the dominant. not just the paramount administrator in this country but the principal legislator as well. And that may be fine when he is your President and you like it. But. it certainly is not fine when he is not your President or is not of your philosophy. I hate to see this body come to the situtation where we are prepared to abdicate our powershere I am not talking about the merits or tile demerits of the Civil Rights Act of 1984to the President because we have managed to involve ourselves in procedures that make it impossible for us to act at all. As I understandthe Senator from Utah can correct me if I am wronghe has filed at least 500 amendments. maybe more. I. as well as anyone. understand the use of the procedures of this body to prevent its operation. Two years ago Senator WEICKER and I and only two or three others managed to carry on a filibuster for almost 2 months on the subject of abortion. We prevented this body from acting until we were close to adjournment. Senator HATCH and his allies are fully able. through the amendment process. whether or not cloture is ever invoked. to prevent the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1984. I. in no way blame him for what he is undertaking. They are procedures that I have undertaken on a different subject where he and I were opposites. Mr. President. these are a legitimate use of the rules of the Senate. But if we all practice them. the Senate will do nothing. If that is what we want to get to. so be it. I also understand on occasion the willingness to fight a losing battle for the sake of getting a vote so that that vote can be used politically in an election. I fear before we are done we are going to have 40 or 50 votes on the continuing resolution of that kind. We are a political body. So long as we understand what it is. we need not be ashamed of that tactic. But I will say this once more in closing. Control of the procedures of democracy is control of the substance. Do not assume that Government is going to stop if we have reached a place in this body where we no longer have procedures that can be operated by anybody to any effective end. What is going to stop is the Senate. I only wish this battle could be put in a cleanhands/ dirtyhands context. but it cannot because I think the people on all sides are honestly motivated. I only wish the battle of procedures could be put in a cleanhands/dirtyhands argument. However. it cannot because every one of us has been guilty of trying to legislate on appropriation bills and complaining when somebody else wants to legislate something we do not want. But I think the time to start. is now and say that hencefor.h when people in this body want to bring up bills of a month ago. or 2 months ago as amendments: Let it happen. Holds by one or two people or refusals by half a dozen to allow them to come up will no longer be tolerated. Then we will not be in a position we are in today. where we reach the last 5 or 6 days and we have to start voting on issues. we have to wrap ourselves in a procedure that leads us all to defeat. When the vote comes today on gerianeness. I am going to vote that this Is indeed germane. It is germane. No question about it. But as I said earlier in this speech. there is nothing any longer that is not germane. By the very process that we are following. for better or worse. we are turning the Government of the United States over to the President of the United States. The irony is that he will not have seized the power from us. we will have ceded it voluntarily. And that is a shame on all of us."

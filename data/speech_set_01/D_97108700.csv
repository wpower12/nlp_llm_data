970033371,Mr. Speaker. I am introducing today a bill designed to provide relief to American farmers who may in the future have the misfortune to entrust the produce of their labors to local grain elevators or warehouse storage facilities that subsequently experience bankruptcy. This is a growing problem that can encumber or tie down agricultural commodities that are farmer owned but held by the elevator awaiting more faverable prices. Parmers today have all the risk they can bear. In my State a A district. farmers are still reeling from the combined effects of drought. low prices. high interest. and growing indebtedness. Their ability to continue to produce Is in doibt in many cases. . At the same time. the increasing frequency of bankruptcy among agriculture storage facilities has added new fears and doubts about the ability of farmers to reclaim their commodities once they have entrusted them to local elevators for storage. The Secretary of Agriculture has had an elevator task force at work on this problem for a number of months. They report that since 1975. there have been 177 grain elevator bankruptcies and more are apparently on the verge of bankruptcy. given the current state of the economy. High interest rates and the extremely risky nature of the grain business have combined to threaten even the best managed elevators. When these economic conditions or poor management are combined with possible illegal activity. diversion of assets. or commodity futures speculation. the threat to the viability of the entire -agricultural commodity storage system becomes very realwith farm ers as the innocent victims. I commend the Secretary for the tentative findings of the elevator task force. This report suggests that higher performance bonds. more stringent licensing. and closer supervision by the governmental agencies may reduce or prevent the problem in the future. I hope this is so. However. nothing in the USDA report addresses the problem of how to bring relief to farmers who have entrusted their grain to storage elevators but have retained title to it. If a bankruptcy occurs. they are the most immediate victims of the bank. ruptcy and an innocent party with little recourse but to await the lengthy bankruptcy procedure in order to secure a return of their property. Having decided on a goodfaith basis to store their grain In the elevator. they suddenly find their property encumbered by a bankruptcy proceeding that renders them powerless to reclaim their property. My bill would assist in providing relief to these producers. It would offer an expedited process of separation of the commodities owned by producers that will occur prior to the disposal of assets of the bankrupt facility. Furthermore. it would *place the holders of valid storage facility receipts in a preferred position for distribution of their property by the bankruptcy court by mrking those receipts prima fade evidence of a right to reclaim a pro rata share of whatever amount of commodity or cash remains at the time of bankruptcy. It would provide for distribution of that property within no more than 180 days unless the bankruptcy judge determined that the Interests of justice or complexiti? of the case requires more time for its resolution. I trust that my colleagues will give strong consideration to a closer examination of this problem. While my bill is not the total answer to the problem it is a means of providing some relief in an expedited process so that the degree of injury to agricultural producers can be minimized.
970037340,Mr. Chairman. I would like to respond to the gentleman from Michigan and others. In their comments they raise a number of points that need to be clarified. First. it is stated. without qualification. that the two binary chemical components are toxic in themselves. This is correct. to a degree. Everything we have in our world is. to a degree. toxic. Let me provide you with a few facts about the two components of the binary munition in question. the 155millimeter artillery projectile. The first component is alcohol. and we all know alcohol can be toxic. but when we compare the alcohol component of the binary with actual nerve agent and other compounds. we can better understand Mr. BONiOR of Michigans statement on toxicity. Let me explain. The isopropyl alcohol. used in the production of isopropyl alcohollanine. is 7.000 times less toxic than nerve agent OB. The alcohol binary component. Isopropyl alcohol/amine. which will be manufactured by industry. is 53.000 times less toxic than nerve agent OB. In a more understanding comparison. ethyl alcohol. which is that spirit which is taken internally by many here in this Chamber and throughout our country. is 15 times more toxic when inhaled than the binary alcohol component. The second component. difluoro. is more toxi than the first. but we are still talking about a chemical compound that is 3.500 times less toxic than the nerve agent itself. Gentlemen. difluoro Is less toxic than tear gas used by our police forces. I submit. therefore. the production of binary chemical munitions will not only provide a modernized stockpile of chemical weapons. but will be extremely safer in production. transportation. storage. and finally handling by our artillery troops. Next. It is suggested that no European allied country has agreed to permit the forward storage of binary chemical munitions on their soil. We are concerned with the building of a facility which will permit us.the United States. to be prepared to produce chemical munitions should the President notify the Congress of the need for production of chemical weapons. The construction of the binary muaitions facility has not been a secret. Its potential has been known by our allies since the positive action taken by the last Congress in authorizing and appropriating the necessary construction funds. I am further assured that our allies are fully aware of the current request which we approved in the fiscal year 1981 supplemental request for $20 million to provide equipment for the plant. To date. I have been Informed by both the Departments of State and Defenise that the allies have expressed no concern with our actions. In fact. our allies consider the current chemical warfare issue an internal national security problem. and recognize that the proper time for their views to be considered is when and if there is a decision by the United States to increase Its forward deployed quantities of chemical munitions. Mr. Chairman. it is not difficult to understand our allies attitudes on this issue. They are. after all. facing the same serious threat. The imbalance in chemical warfare capabilities which necessitates the need for modernizing our stockpile is a risk which they equally share. Further. the silence of our allies should be interpreted as an indication that there is a serious concern for the chemical threat in Europe. and they are waiting for the United States to exercise its position of leadership. Mr. Chairman. we must not abandon the leadership responsibility we have within NATO. We must convey to our allies that the responsibility for deterring chemical warfare is the paramount issue. and that the United States is ready to act responsively and decisively. It is suggested that the House has not conducted distinct and thorough hearings on this matter since 1975. I must differ with my distinguished colleague because I know that the 96th Congress. as well as this Congress. has. in fact. had a number of hearings on this subject. There were extensive floor debates in both the House and Senate last year and in the Senate this year. as well as numerous closed hearings in both Housesnecessarily closed because of the classification and national security Implications of the chemical warfare threat and the poor U.S. postureall of which thoroughly discussed the issue at hand. I must differ. therefore. with the statement that the issue has only received passIng reference in the Congress. I believe the Congress has acted. and is acting most responsibly. I must point out that war has more of a catastrophic potential from the use of nuclear weaponsa position we could be forced into if we have no credible chemical deterrent/retallatory capability upon which to rely. My dear colleagues. if deterrence falls. we must have a flexible response option. and this means chemical weapons with which to retaliate if it becomes necessary. A strong chemical defense only posture will not deter nor allow us to overcome the advantages gained by SovietWarsaw Pact use of chemical weapons without our having to resort to nuclear weapons. It is suggested that the binary facility should not be built because of the current bilateral negotiations between the U.S.S.R. and the United States to achieve a ban on the production and use of chemical warfare munitions and agents. I question the premise that delay of our binary stockpile modernization program would aid in these negotiations. Mr. Chairman. first I would like to clarify one point. We ceased producing nerve gas in 1969 at the direction of the then Deputy Secretary of Defense. the Honorable David Packard. and that. Mr. Chairman. was because we were looking at new technologythe binary munition. The negotiations which have been referred to have not been as productive as many believe. or 1.ant to believe. Since the negotiations began in 1977. the United States has attempted to achieve a comprehensive arms control agreement. The goal in these negotiations is a joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. proposal to the Committee on Disarm ament. which would thpn negotiate a multilateral chemical arms control treaty. Bilateral negotiations have met with only limited success. Disagreement continues to exist in verification. declaration of stockpiles and facilities. and entryintoforce. It is unlikely that a joint proposal will be reached in the near term. The Defense Science Board summer study. reviewing the overall chemical program. concluded that there were only poor prospects for achieving an acceptable chemical warfare treaty. To negotiate. one must be able to bargain from a position of strength. I submit to this Chamber that we do not have this luxury. If we continue our course. then the effect will assuredly be unilateral disarmament by the late 1980s. In view of this. it becomes readily apparent that the Soviets would have no need to enter into an agreement. However. to produce binary weapons could be the necessary ingredient that we need to get these talks moving. In a recent letter to the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator TOWER. the Secretary of State. Mr. Haig. stated: The Administration considers it vital that the United States maintain the credibility of its chemical weapons deterrent. Since no steps have been taken since 1969 to ensure the continuing effectiveness of this deterrent. it Is now in serious danger of deterlo. rating and of losing its credibility. Pared with this urgent need. we think it important to take advantage of the significant safety and environmental advantages afforded by binary weapons. The Administrations decision does not represent a new policy departure in tihe chemical weapons area. nor a decision to place greater emphasis upon chemical weapons in our overall national security policy. Rather. It represents a necessary step in maintaining the effectiveness of existing United States policy of no first use of chemical weapons. and the maintenance of a limited (but effective) retaliatory capabillty. And lastly. a few words on the Soviet capability. The question is raised about the activities of the Soviet Union over the past years. Let me say that even though the Information that I have seen is classified. and what I am about to say is unclassified. the Soviets have not been dormant. There is shocking proof of extensive research efforts and improvement in producLion capability. Soviet forces are continually upgraded with new. modern. and sophisticated equipment that will permit them to operate in a toxic environment for extended periods. I personally believe the evidence of their reported use of chemicals in Afghanistan supports their doctrine of using chemicals to achieve their goals. and irrespective of their obligation under treaty. international law. or any concern for humanity. Mr. Chairman. it is suggested that we will be authorizing the killing of innocent civilians. and that the overwhelming majority of victims will then be unprotected civilians. Let me say that if the Soviets or other states are not deterred from Initlating chemical warfare. then unnecessary loss of civilian life. as is suggested. will most certainly occur from chemical weapons. as well as from other. more catastrophic weapons which may have to be relied on to try and negate the significant advantages the Soviets will have gained from using chemical weapons. If anything. this argument Is strong rationale for developing a credible chemical deterrent capability rather than spurning one. It has been said before. and I will say it again. that defense is not enoughany football coach will tell you that. The severe combat degradation and unit ineffectiveness caused by the use of chemical defensive equipment is more than enough in itself to cause an enemy to use chemical weap. ons. Just think what our capability would be If chemical weapons were used against our forces. and our enemy was not forced to the same degraded posture. Gentlemen. if the Soviets employed chemicals today. NATO could suffer a decisive defeat if it did not exercise Its nuclear option. And in a period of nu. II12711 clear parity. or possibly even inferiority. the nuclear option is not the deterrent of 10 to 20 years ago. Mr. Chairman. it is also suggested that the binary modernization program will cost $4 billion. and our tax money would be better spent on defense. First of all. to my knowledge the estimated cost of developing acredible deterrent/retaliatory capability by binary modernization is about $2 billion at the very most. The $4 billion mentioned covers costs over the next 20 years. and includes $2 billion or more for demilitarization of the current aging and obsolescent stockpilethe very reason why modernization is required. This demilitarization cost is a given whether we niodernize or not. The comment that chemical weapons have no military utility If we have protective gear is simply wrong. The inability for over 100 years to conclude an effective prohibition of chemical weapons attests to the signiflcance of chemical warfare. The Soviets know the significance of chemical warfare. and they are not going to give up their capability when they are the superior. The point has already been well made that while defensive or protective equipment is necessary for survival. it will not. in itself. deter chemical attack. the required chemical protective clothing and equipment degrade a fighting force. Is the cost of one aircraft carrier. or even if it were more. worth the possibility of losing a war in Europe or being forced to resort to nuclear weapons? I think not. And finally. Mr. Chairman. I submit that if the Soviets are not deterred from initiating chemical warfare. and if NATO allies continue to take little or no action to protect the civilian population. large and unnecessary loss of civilian life will certainly occur. Mr. Chairman. our efforts here today seek to protect the civilian populace of Europe by development of a production facility which will either cause the Soviets to negotiate with reason. or allow the United States to acquire a credible deterrent. To take the necessary action to deter chemical warfare cannot be either inhumane or immoral. To do nothing any longer is assuredly both.
970088661,"Mr. Chairman. the House has before It the 1981 farm bill. Based on the effort that has been expended by Members of this body this year in reconciling budgetary restraint with the legitimate needs and demands of the American people for protection and services. I can anticipate that the outcome of the farm bill debate must Inevitably be inadequate to the needs of the farm sector because those needs are large. However. there Is a critical level below which we cannot sustain further cuts. After the Senate completed action on the legislation In a way I believed to be too severe for farmers. I called In a number of reporters who cover legislation affecting my State and district to convey to them my views on the farm bill and my apprehension regardIng the future of agriculture. I will try to convey to my colleagues some of the reasons for that apprehension. In my view. two words can summarize the situation. ""Imminent depression."" The situation our farmers face today Is the result of a variety of factors which have converged this year and they will be familiar to many. I will briefly review a few of them. First. Costs of production: The inflation in producer costs has steadily mounted to a point that USDA data comparing prices paid by farmers with prices received by farmers has long since moved in opposite directions. Farm input costs since the mid1970s have consistently trended upward to a point that the Index of 1981 costs are H 6910 CO] 300 percent of those seen In 1967. During the same period. prices received by farmers have been on a roller coaster that has gone down much more than up and has trended dowvnward consistently in 1981. The 1981 Index of prices received Is barely double those seen In 1967 and the large gains In farmer Income made In the early 1970s have long since been lost to the inflationary surges of the past few years. The costs of farming cannot indefinitely exceed the Income generated from It. Second. Reliance on export markets: The farm bills of 1973 and 1977 were based on the expectation that U.S. farmers would be able to sell In an open world market where millions of hungry people would eagerly seek the produce of Americas farms. To some extent. that Is accurate In that our export volume has grown significantly. Nonetheless. many pitfalls have shaken the farmers confidence in ""market oriented"" agriculture. Export volume and dollar value have expanded dramatically in the past decade. The value of agricultural exports rose from $7 billion in 1970 to $44 billion in 1981 while the export tonnage rose from 61 million metric tons to 164 million metric tons. Despite this remarkable performance. U.S. farmers have slipped deeper into economic quicksand at the same time they have massively expanded production. In the 1970s there were emnbargoes for short supply reasons and in 198081. there was an embargo for foreign policy and national security reasons. In this stop and go atmosphere. farmers have been encouraged to produce for an export market that has been a doubleedged sword. As they h(Lve fought hunger abroad and helped to reduce the trade deficits of the United States. their equity in their land and resources has been sacrificed. Heavy pressures have been placed on fragile land resources and the future ability of farn~ers. to remain In full scale production has been brought Into question. Farm debt has steadily mounted and there has been a steep decline in net farm income. Third. Farm Income:. The bottom line In any industry is the issue of profitability. For many farmers in my district. there Is not any and has not been any for several years. One of the most positive effects on the economy would be a return to profitability for agriculture. There clearly Is not going to be any again this year for most. USDA is forecasting net farm income to be below $20 billion for the second year In a row. The widely quoted study by Richard Pottorff of Data Resources. Inc.. of Lexington. Mass.. noted that this figure. when adjusted for inflation. is the lowest net income level for farmers since 1934. His conclusion that the farm sector of the United States is in a crisis unlike any seen since the Great Depression is certainly true In Arkansas. The severe drought of 1080 wvas unlike anything our farmers had seen since the 1930s. In Arkansas. It contributed to a major Jump in farm Indebtedness and prevented any prospect for an adequate Income for farmers. The Farmers Home Administration and the Small Business Administration currently have a combined total of farm loans In Arkansas in excess of three quarters of a billion dollars. It will take many years to retire this level of debt and unless there Is a dramatic change in the prospects for farm income. I am certain that many of our farmers will be forced out of business by their debt loads and poor income prospects. SUMMARY The farm bill we will debate in the next few days will not be the salvation of American agriculture. It cannot be and is not designed to be. However. if the levels of protection provided by the Senate are maintained. then the farm bill will impede any prospect for agricultural recovery. I urge that my colleagues support the bill reported out by the House Agriculture Committee. It is a bill we worked very long and hard on. It does meet the budgetary guidelines we adopted earlier this year. and it Is a barebones minimum below which we cannot cut without contributing to an even greater hemorrhage to agriculture. the Nations lifeblood."
970106313,Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague from Arkansas for yielding. It gives me great pleasure to be able to participate in this special order to talk about Brooks Hays. I only knew Brooks since 1979 personally. but I knew him by reputation. for a man of humor and a man of principle previous to that. because of his many public stances and because of his dedicated service to the House of Representatives from the State of Arkansas. In. 1979. as the gentleman will recall. we attended a CloseUp Foundation luncheon. It was during that speech that he made that I realized that here was really a truly walking legend. I thought. among politicians. because he had elevated the word politics to such a high level that you could see that this was the type of person that truly could lead and instill great wishes and desires in our young people. It was the way that he intertwined humor and wit also with principles and goals. that as the gentleman will recall. that we got together and decided that we would like to bring that CloseUp program into the State of Arkansas and if we were successful In doing that. we would like to dedicate that program to Brooks Hays. We were successful. We did bring that program into the State of Arkansas on a voluntary basis. on a trial basis. It has now become a permanent fixture with the State of Arkansas. Brooks Hays helped us Inaugurate that at a press Conference in the gentlemans home district of Little Rock. Ark. It was well attended and again because of his flair for wit and humor. it insured that that program would be a success. I do have with me today some letters and some comments from some people that are associated with CloseUp. It would do me great pleasure to be able to put those comments Into the RECORD today and also have comments and a letter from a teacher from my home district. Miss Bettie Hill of Ashdown. Ark. I would also ask to have those comments placed in the RECORD. Mr. Speaker. Brooks Hays Involvement In Government spanned the generation gap. In the early seventies. he worked with the leadership of the CloseUp Foundation with the vision and Imagination usually associated with younger men. He was truly devoted to educating Americas youth about the political process. He inspired the staff of the CloseUp Foundation in its earliest. most challenging days. and he continued to inspire its teacher and student participants through his wonderful appearances over the course of CloseUps first decade. Everyone who attended his talks. filled with vivid anecdotes and personal reflections as well as a philosophy based on hope and faith. could not help but walk a little taller and feel a little prouder about being an American. Mr. Speaker. I would like to read some of the tributes paid to Brooks by people associated with the CloseUp program:
970117638,Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague for yielding. I have been listening to -the discussion about other programs that are being cut. and the comment was made that these were people programs. I just want us to know that It takes people to operate this machinery. and it alsotakes people to operate the farms. I would Just like to talk to my colleague in the well for a minute about what may be In store for agriculture. I would like to read first a letter that I just received today from one of the more prominent -farmers In my area. and then I would like to discuss a telephone call that I had with two of the farmers who are also very prominent in my district and point out some of the concerns they have expressed to me. Then I would just like to ask a question of the gentleman in the well as to whether or not there is any hope in the continuing resolution or even in the farm bill for those farmers. George L. Pugh is a farmer from Portland. Ark. and he wrote me this letter. I will read the first paragraph because he does say some nice things to me. He wrote this: DEAR BEsni: I appreciate the stand you have taken In agriculture for the last few years. arnd I feel you have done an excellent job of representing the Arkansas farmer. This Is the most critical part of the letter. and I say to my colleagues who are trying to decide on the farm bill In conference that I hope they will listen to this also: This letter Is simply to tell you that never In the last twentythree years have I seen the agricultural economy In the shape we are In at the present. 1980 wan a drought year with emergency loan baling out 15 percent of the farmers. 1981 was an average year overall in production. but high interest rates and devastating low prices have put Arkansas agriculture deep in debt. There Is no way local financial Institutions can approach and help these neople. We all want goverrunent out of agriculture. We all want free markets. but the problems that have been created are things farmers have little control over. Agriculture Is all small towns like Portland have to look to for the future. I might point out that Portland is a town of less than 500 population.. The letter continues: The only quick solution to our problem Is a short term mandatory acreage reduction. Rice. soybeans. cotton. and corn are priced below cost of production. I support a short term mandatory 10 percent acreage reduction. for the Arkansas farmer can no longer plant and hope. Cotton that brought 7580 cents 1n 1980 is selling in todays inflated market at 58 cents simply because the farmer Is efficient! We appreciate your help. and I hope you will discuss with the Secretary of Agriculture an acreage control solution. Mr. Speaker. I know that my colleague In the well represents a farming community. and It is somewhat alarming when we hear farmers talking about mandated Federal Government acreage control. I think that shows us how serious the problem Is. Before I defer to the gentleman in the well for a response. I would Just like to repeat a telephone call that I had with another . gentleman. a farmer. He Is 44 years old. He says that he has been farming since he was old enough to tie his shoes.. He says that conditions are the worst that he has ever seen them. He said that with cotton production return to break even set at 95 cents by the USDA. he sold his crop for 58 cents. and he said he is getting $10 per bale less. He owns a large farm. He Is making $300.000 less. He pays no rent. he has a small indebtedness on the land. he has good equity. and he is Just barely going to break even. But. he said. he has been renting to a gentleman for 35 years. His family has been renting to this other farmer for 35 years 120 acres. He is going to make 95 bales. and he is going to sell at 58 cents. He has two sons in their midtwenties. and he said this year they are selling out. He said they own 80 acres that they also farm. but he is going to put that on the auction block. He Is going to get about $2.000 per acre. He hopes to pay his bank off. he hopes to clear his house. and he said he probably will not be able to pay the Farmers Home Loan Association but perhaps they will give him a forbearance on It. He said that with his wife working and with him going to a factory job. maybe they can make it. This gentleman also talked about acreage controls. But. more importantly. both these farmers are representing a cross section of farmers who are asking. what is the Federal Government going to do to help the farmer in My response has been that the other bodys agricultural policy was a blueprint for disaster. We have an administration worried more about dollars than they are abouit policy. I have told them that there Is not much they can look to as far as Government relief Is concerned. Does the gentleman see anything in the continuing resolution that could help these farmers?
970160992,"I thank my colleague. the gentleman from Arkansas. for yielding. I would like to enter into the colloquy at this point. I intend to introduce further remarks into the RECORD as part of this special order. but since the gentleman was talking about the cause for that red line going below. I think there is another factor that is there that is often misinterpreted. and that is. simply. the aggravation of prime interest rates in the Uited States. When you have high interest rates in the United States. you have not an undervalued dollar. but you have an overvalued dollar. So at a time when the volume of agricultural products is growing. you have our foreign buyers capable of purchasing less in real terns because of the overstated value of the dollar. due to the high interest rates in the United States. So at a time when you can look at a chart and see the volume is going up. the net real return in spendable dollars to the farmer is going down because of this additional cost. That is another reason that we must at all costs get these high interest rates down. It will help the farmer not only in exports. but it will also help him in !iis cost of production problems. I ttdnk the gentleman should be commended for bringing that chart forward so that the public can be educated on an additional factor over and above what we all know when we go to the bank to borrow money. we know it from a personal standpoint. Sometimes we do not know how it tracks through the entire world economy. and the gentleman has very clearly demonstrated that point. L Mr. Speaker. the National Rural Electric Cooperatives are meeting this week and many are in attendance here today. It is particularly appropriate when we discuss the farm economy to remember the great contribution of the REA Cooperatives to the standard of living in rural areas. With much of our Nations farm area today in the grip of a serious dollar bind that calls forth dark memories of 1933. and what we then called the ""farmled. farmfed depression."" it is essential that Congress acts to protect the REA loan funds from those who would unwisely cut them. Net farm income. adjusted for Inflation. was a thin $8 billion in 1981. a gloomy reminder of the $6 billion figure we saw in 1933. Farm prices last year were measured at 60 percent of parity. a close parallel to the 59 percent of 1933. Todays farmers stagger under a burden of debt whose interest costs alone each year soak up nearly a full years farm income. and this income is expected to drop another 25 percent this year. As this farm and rural platform for our economy sinks into economic trouble that may well be catastrophic for all of us. we see another move by the administration to choke off the dollars of financing that are absolutely essential for a major source of rural power supply. The proposed fiscal year 1983 budget offered by the administration would squeeze Rural Electrification Administration loans to their lowest level since 1976. In the electric power sector which historically has been markedly capital intensive. this would strand nearly 1.000 userowned rural electric cooperatives more than $1 billion short of their anticipated need for borrowed dollars. This would force these nonprofit systems to the open market for borrowed moneyif. indeed. they would find it available to them thereand would build into their already high rates the added costs of increased interest expense. Mr. Speaker. we simply must not permit added burdens of costparticularly unnecessary burdensto be laid on this already struggling rural economy. Increased borrowing costs will mean increased electric rates for rural consumers. igniting one more inflationary expense for 25 million rural people who already pay substantially more for electric service than their urban neighbors. The Federal Government does not subsidize rural electric systems in their effort to maintain an adequate service for memberowners at reasonably economical rates. The impressive tax benefit subsidies already granted to investorowned electric utilities suggests that similar support to rural American might well be justified. I suggest now. however. that we do not add to tie grave troubles of our rural population by pushing them toward higher interest costs and oppressiye electric bills. REA loan programs which serve these memberowned systems do not add to the Federal budget. nor do they require added tax dollars from our citizens. They simply represent the peoples government helping the peoples rural electric service to borrow at reasonably favorable rates. It never has been enough to claim that this Government is of and by the people. The botton line is that it must be for the people too. I urge. Mr. Speaker. that Members of this body hold fast to that fundamental purpose by insisting that we permit no artificial barrier between 25 million rural people and the level of offbudget REA loan funds that will help them to help themselves. Mr. Speaker. the economy of Arkansas is suffering terribly from the current economic depression in agriculture. forestry. and housing. These industries are the very foundation of the entire States economy and I have seen no signs of the.. beginning of a recovery. The current outlook is for a third consecutive year of very low net farm income. with many farmers certain to go out of business in view of their indebtedness. Many more. perhaps the majority. will be more deeply in debt by the end of this year and their longterm survival will be in doubt. I am convinced that 1982 will be the most critical year yet for agriculture. Our farmers could begin a recovery leading to prosperity. due to world demand from food and fiber products. Or it could be a year in which more farmers go bankrupt than at any time since the Depression of the 1930s. In either case. it will not be just farmers who are affected. The jobs and income produced by and from our farms. fields. and forests extend far beyond the basic producer. In my State we have a $20 billion a year economy. According to recent research done by the Arkansas Industrial Research and Extension Center in Little Rock. 20 percent of the States earned income is a direct result of the agricultural and forestry industries. Any economic stress in these industries shows up immediately in the unemployment statistics and income data. Official unemployment in Arkansas was 12.3 percent in the most recent monthly statistics. However. in many countries where farming and forestry predominate. the unemployment levels exceed 20 percent. At this critical time. people who are not directly involved in agriculture should reflect on what a great resource we have in our highly productive farm economy. Our farmers feed all Americans and millions more around the world. Because they are producing for a world economy. the current worldwide economic recession affects them more directly in terms of income than most other Americans. The average American spends only about 16 percent of his income on food. far lower than anywhere else in the world. Yet. the farmers share of the money spent by consumers has been shrinking for years. On the average. farmers receive only slightly more than 36 cents of each dollar spent on food. Food is the greatest bargain in America but those who produce it face few economic rewards for their labors. The causes of the farmers dilemma are many and complex. Cost of pro. duction. due to inflation. have run ahead of increases in commodity prices for most of the last decade. After the temporary boom of the early 1970s ended. farm income began to lag. Only in 1979 was there any temporary improvement in farm income. However. in the last 2 years. the bottom has dropped out of farm income. In 1980. there was a massive drought that totally destroyed crops in my State and many others. In 1981. a good harvest occurred but prices declined each month during the entire year. and farmers again found themselves with little or nothing to show for their efforts. Almost all suffered a net reduction in their equity situation. I have secured some data prepared by Schnittker Associates. an agricultural consulting firm here in Washington. The 1982 farm income prospects in current dollars and adjusted for inflation are incredibly disastrous. As can be seen. they estimate net farm income in a range of $14 to $16 billion. In terms of purchasing power. 1982 will be the worst year for farmers since 1933. The purchasing power in 1967 dollars may be no more than $5 billion. That is only onethird of the level of 1979. adjusted for inflation. I ask unanimous consent to place that data in the RECORD. These statistics are revealing but they do not convey the message as well as that which farmers have been telling me for months. In January and February. I held several meetings with farmers in my district. Their outcry of anguish over low prices. high production costs and high interest rates was unanimous. Almost to a man.. they are prepared to reduce production if there is any prospect of receiving a fair price for it. Many of us tried to persuade the administration last year that the situation w:s grim in rural America and that a farm bill was needed that provided more assistance to farmers. Our protests fell on deaf ears as the administrations farm proposals were rammed through Congress with few opportunities for compromise. The result is that there is not adequate protection for farmers at this time of crisis. the worse since the 1930s. An entire generation of farmers and thousands of small communities around the Nation are in peril. The administrations economic program. brought forward with such fanfare last year. is proving to be a colossal failulte. The reduction in demand it has generated. combined with the large harvest last year. has contributed to a high build up of farm commodities and depressed prices."
970176943,"Mr. Chairman. there are four additional areas in which requests for rescissions are requested that would have a crippling effect on education. If you come from a State that already has a low education base. such as I do in the State of Arkansas. it will just add misery upon misery. Compensatory education has a $411 million rescission request. Handicapped education has a $259 million rescission request. Rehabilitation education has a $350 million rescission request. and vocational education has a $100 million rescission request. cuts that I could not support. When it comes to the elderly. the State of Arkansas ranks second only behind the State of Florida in Its percentage of elderly. population. We have already heard many other Members talk about medicare. I would like to talk about medicare from the standpoint of a State like Arkansas. It would create great problems for our elderly population. As I perceive. reading the Latta budget. the Aspin substitute and the Jones sustitute. if Latta is passed. what I must go home and tell my senior citizens is that I have voted to increase their deductibles. increase their copayments and increase their insurance premiums. . I will not be able to look them In the eye and truthfully say that I have done anything as their representative to lower health costs. All I will be able to do is say yes. I have shifted the cost from the Federal Government so that we can lower tht deficit and I have shifted it to many thousands of senior citizens across the country. I for one am not willing to go home and look my senior citizens in the eye and tell them that I have shifted the cost rather than cut the cost. Also. in the fact that I do serve on the subcommittee that will have to be debating these particular medicare legislative proposals. I have already taken some liberty of studying them in depth. For one legislators opinion. I say that they are unrealisitic and they are unachievable. as many others also agree. Arkansas last year had to shift $26 million out of its aid for families with dependenTh children program to Its medicald fund because It was In a $20 million shortfall. This budget that would be proposed by the gentleman from Ohio would shift additional cost to the medicald program. and I simply tell you that Arkansas. as many other States. is in no financial shape to pick up the tab. The elderly would be hurt with less health care being provided. Energy is the fourth category that I am interested in. We use in the State of Arkansas the REA. The work is not completed with the REA. The Jones budget treats REA positively. We can continue some good work with the REA in the State of Arkansas and other southern rural areas. The Latta budget. if passed. will cut the insured loans. It will cut the loan guarantee. From a reading of the detailed report. it appears it will be approximately a 30percent cut. a cut that I think is unfair. unconscionable. and would be increasing the cost of borrowing. therefore increasing the utility cost for rural Americans. Again. I cannot go home and tell ny people that I voted for that. It also cuts research and development for solar. geothermal. renewable resources. fusion. and also conservation. Basically. Mr. Chairman. what it says. if I go home. is that the United States has no energy policy. I can tell you that It will not be long before OPEC will come to grips with the world glut of oil. We will see higher energy prices if we do not move forward with an energy policy. We will only come back to this floor and this body and say that we are going to pay the piper once again. We have been given two warnings. We cannot afford to wait for the third. MVIrs. IARTIN of Illinois. Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I think It is wise to debate all the budgets that are being offered. but we must debate them on the same ground and a few statements have been made. I am sure unintentionally. that do not correctly reflect what happens to be in the bipartisan package. I know that the excellent and truthful chairman of the Budget ComH 12793 mittee would want those facts available to everyone here. First of all. there has been a letter passed around by the National Homebuilders Association. I think it vorries all of us who are concerned about homebuilders. You will be pleased. I think. to know that we also have a letter from the Congressional Budget Office stating that the numbers on which the National Homebuilders made their judgments were. indeed. in error. so that we have to then look at the numbers that exist now and what the Latta substitute truly says in terms of what will be available for housing. First of all. the 1983 housing credit is at a level of $18 billion above the Presidents original budget. There is a 70percent increase for rural housing. There is room for emergency housing in the budget. Elderly housing assistance is at twice the Presidents level. equal to the Jones package. Rural housing is equal to the Jones package. I just wanted you to know this. so that we do not misunderstand the housing provisions in the Latta substitute. In other words. the Latta substitute provides the same amount in fiscal years 1983 through 1984 for emergency housing as does the Jones. Now. you may not like the Latta substitute for other reasons. You might not like the Jones substitute. but you should know those housing numbers are the same. A second issue I think important is. of course. medicare. and especially Its effect on senior citizens. . I think all of you may wish to know that the Latta substitute does not do some of the things that I am hearing it does. If it did. obviously. Mr. LArrA and other sponsors would not be working for it. In fact. the claim that the recipients of medicare will be punished is just blatantly false. Both the Jones substitute and the coalition substitute. project 3year medicare savings of $9.4 billion. which is about 5 percent of the current cost. The Bipartisan Recovery budget assumes 3year savings of $23.2 billion. or 11.6 percent of projected current law costs. They are achieved by incorporating almost all of the Jones and coalition savings measures. plus $13.4 billion additional for a major hospital cost containment package. In other words. it is not the recipients of medicare. the beneficiaries that are going to be cut. Some wealthy doctors indeed. yes. some hospitals whose attempted economies kind of fascinate me with their ""buy. build and buy."" yes. Now. if you want to protect them. believe me. that is your perfect right. but let us not hear that it is going to be the beneficiaries. I am just saying. since medicare. those costs have gone up for everyone and you cannot say no one is going to bear them. This time we are not going to punish people that need hospital help. We are going to say to those who have provided it that. ""guess what. you have charged enough for too long and you have to pull In your belts. not the elderly. I do not know many doctors and physicians. much as I like them. who are In the welfare lines. I do not know how many hospital board members are out there saying they need food stamps. We are saying. ""pull in your belts."" Now. I will be happy to yield to the gentleman from New York and then to the chairman. the gentleman from Oklahoma."
970228894,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to talk about the $150 exemption. The conferees moved this up from a hundred doll*r level to a $150 level. trying to alleviate the fears of those who think they would be adversely impacted by this. What Is the effect of this? It is not insignificant and I think the membership should pay attention to this. At a 7percent interest rate. the principal amount would have to exceed $2.000 in order to generate interest in excess of the $1�0 level of exemption. Even then. the withholding would only be about $1510 percent times 150 equals $15. The Credit Union National Association has prepared materials which indicate that 84.5 percent of the credit union savings accounts are under $2.000. so we are only looking at that top 15 percent. those that are most capable of complying with this rule. What have the conferees done in order to alleviate some of the problems? I would like to tick them off for you. First. the effective date is delayed by 6 months to July 1 at a revenue loss of approximately $1.1 billion. Second. the conferees agreed to allow the Secretary to provide an additional 6 months for any payor that could not implement the system on July 1 without undue hardship. How much fairer can you be to our institutions? No. 3. the conferees also increased the amount of interest that could be exempt from withholding. at the option of the institution. to $150 on an annual basis. Finally. in order to take care of the additional software costs. the administrative costs. the conferees took .this into consideration and there are generous ""float"" rules that are permitted to all Institutions for the.first year of withholding to compensate for startup costs. an additional 30 calendar days on average for making deposits of withheld taxes. Small- and mediumsized banks. savings and loans. and credit unions. would be allowed to use these ""float"" rules for a longer period to time. again. the conferees trying to be extremely fair under the circumstances to the institutions. I would like to close by just making one additional point. If you are con. cerned that the effects would be adverse to encourage savings. let.us look at the facts and let us compare them with what would be the normal reaction of a depositor. Let us assume $1.000 in savings at 7percent interest. that is only $7. Very insignificant. Now. even assuming a 12percent money market rate of interest. you are only talking about $12. If this were increased tenfold. we would still only be talking about $120. I submit to you that argument is a fallacious argument when you say that amount of money withheld is going to change the dynamics of the people saving money. This rule was put into effect to make sure that those people who are not presently paying their fair share do pay their fair share. When Members go home and discuss the issue with our citizens who do pay their fair share. Members can say. ""It is a compliance provision. We are trying to make sure that those who are refusing to report interest income and dividend income and pay taxes are required to pay what is due the Treasury."""
970231884,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of passage of H.R. 5831. This important legislation has originated in the House Agriculture Committees Subcommittee on Conservation. Credit and Rural Development. chaired by our able and distinguished colleague. ED JONES of Tennessee. As a former member of this subcommittee. I am particularly aware of the H 6818 CO critical nature of this bill for American agriculture. It is imperative that our farmers and the rural sector of the country have access to the financial assistance and credit provided by it as soon as possible. In my State of Arkansas. the Farmers Home Administration is more than the lender of last resort. It is the only lifeline keeping many of my farmers afloat at this time of economic disaster for agriculture. As many of my colleagues have noted in this and earlier debates on the economy. the farm sector has been suffering longer than any other during the recent economic recession. In Arkansas. we have suffered through the 3 worst years in my lifetime. The drought of 1980 destroyed crops all over the State and 1981 and 1982 have been years of economic disaster. Now. FmHA reports that there are 3.349 operating loans and 6.485 emergency loans in the State of Arkansas in which farmers may well be unable to meet existing payment obli. gations. given todays low prices. The level of delinquency on these loans exceeded 60 percent in January of this year and will go higher by January of 1983. Even with extensive subordination by FmHA to other lenders and some refinancing of debts. the delinquency levels on loans in Arkansas could not be reduced below 30 percent this year. The loan ceilings for the various FmHA programs have received modest and very necessary increases. More needs to be done but our farmers recognize that at this time of budgetary restraint. the levels proposed will have to be sufficient. The bill also provides for borrowers to receive a 1year deferral of principal and interest repayments when they can show that they have used good farming practices. but economic conditions prevent repayment as scheduled. This temporary relief will enable our farmers to gain a reprieve from possible foreclosure in the most extreme cases. I urge my colleagues to join with the members of the Agriculture Committee in approving this very necessary legislation. A broad base of support for this bill will reassure our farmers that Congress will not abandon them at the time of their greatest need.
970273789,Mr. Chairman. I think there have been some facts laid out here that need to be corrected to a considerable extent. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. our American citizens. have they been mistreated? We are giving them a turnback of the excise taxes. When the gentleman from Georgia said that they did not ask for it. a trade representative before the full committee stated that that was one of the first concessions that the gentleman from the Virgin Islands asked for and did receive before the bill was even put in bill form. In addition. to that. there is an exemption in there from EPA regulations. In a separate piece of legislation there is the ability to manufacture watches by putting the parts together. That bill has passed the House. A similar provision is in a bill that presently is over in the other body. On the tax side. where these countries in the Caribbean do not get any tax benefits. because we did not see fit to put that in this section this year but may address it next year. you have section 936. that Puerto Rico. and section 934. that the Virgin Islands participate in. Over and above that. scattered throughout our entire Federal Internal Revenue Code. there are several income tax exemp. tions that are special for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which encourage domestic companies to go into those two areas and to invest. There are no similar provisions that will be going into the countries that will hope to participate in the Caribbean Basin Initiative. So when you take into consideration all of the things that we have put into our statutes and the things that we are going to put into it if this passes. we can safely say. if it passes. and if the de Lugo amendment goes down. that we have treated those American citizens more than fairly. So do not feel ashamed if you do vote against the de Lugo amendment. We have made adequate concessions. We have had a growth in the rum market like you have never seen. It has grown since 1966 at a rate of 70 percent every 5 years. All these small countries are asking you to do is to be able to participate without a quota and without a trigger mechanism. to be able to come In and buy just a small part of that increase in the future. We are talking about dollars. Let us put it in some type of perspective. $100 million to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1981. What did all of the Caribbean countries get? Four million dollars. Now. you tell me where these little bitty countries are going to come in and run Bacardi out. of business. where they are going to come in and suddenly be a threat to an industry that has a foothold of $100million to $4 million and is expected to grow faster than any other of the distilled spirits. Let us talk about symbolism. The gentleman from New York (Mr. (CONABLE) made the point. and it needs to be reemphasized. Rum is symbolic to Puerto Rico..and it is symbolic to the Virgin Islands. I recognize that. I am sensitive to that. But we have taken out everything that these people have an opportunity to participate in. They can go tourism. and they ban go rum. If we put quotas and trigger mechanisms on rum. it definitely will have a chilling effect. Why would any investor go in and try to make a longrange commitment to penetrate a growing market if they know that their success will only bump them up against a quota? No reasonable businessman is going to go In. That chilling effect will continue to hold these people down. What do they need? More than form. they need some substance. and here Is the one area that this body can give. We can give them some form. we can give them some substance. and we can still say that we have not hurt Puerto Rico and we have not hurt the Virgin Islands. In fact. we have treated them more than adequately and more than fair. We will make some strong friends down in the Caribbean. and that is exactly what we need to do.

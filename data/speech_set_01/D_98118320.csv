980011313,Mr. Chairman. almost a half century ago. men and women stood In this Chamber and debated the creation of social security. Critics of the program. primarily from the other side of the aisle. labeled the concept dangerous. socialistic. and unworkable. Those in the New Deal who labored to create social security did so with a vision that our elderly In generations to come would live in dignity and independence. I stand here today as a beneficiary of their vision. Our grandparents. parents. and millions of Americans live richer and fuller lives because of that vision. But each generation must carry its burden for the future and as a new Member of Congress I have been called upon early in this session to face the difficult choices as to the future of social security. I rise today. having made my choice. to support the Pepper amendment. And I do so for several reasons. First. the provision in the Pickle amendment. which raises the retirement age. actually reduces benefits and is part of a longterm solution which I consider wrongheaded and dangerous. To face the coal miners in my 20th Congressional District. who have lived a life fighting off black lung and tell them they must wait 2 more years. 2 more years for retirement In generations to come. is a burden that I would not take horie lightly. To force recipients 18 years from now into a level of reduced benefits is to deny the basic goals of social security. the dignity and independence which our predecessors fought so hard for 50 years ago. I concede the inherent fallibility of this process. Only 5 years jgo. men and women in this Chamber. stood and announced to our Nation that they had saved the social security system and they were convinced that they had insured its financial Integrity for years to come. They were mistaken. Our efforts today are an attempt to right the balance in the most successful social program this Nation has ever conceived or created. What if we are wrong today? The Pepper amendment and his approach gives us more flexibility than any alternative. primarily because it does not force recipients to make difficult and irreversible decisions early in their working careers. Increasing the retirement age could force decisions by people my age in their selection of personal retirement plans which might not be remedied or modified without considerable expense or hardship. If we are wrong today and our economy makes a better recovery than we envision. we have it within our power to reduce or eliminate this future tax. The choices before us are not easy. But if our predecessors in this Chamber had the courage to create social security. let us today have the courage to insure its integrity in the future. Senator PEPPERs amendment continues that fine tradition. a tradition and a vision of independence and dignity for senior citizens. I proudly support Senator PEPPERs efforts and urge my colleagues to join me.
980097025,"Mr. Chairman. I concede that the second amendment is more controversial than the first. I appreciate the opportunity to raise this morning before Congress what I think is an important element as we consider this particular piece of legislation. Yesterday during the general debate on this bill It was repeated often that in addition to millions of bluecollar workers who- are presently unemployed in this country. there are millions of whitecollar unemployed workers. I live in a State capital In Springfield. Ill. Many administrators and white collar workers who had jobs for years have found themselves unemployed for the first time. I happen to believe that one of the things we should set out to do specifically with this piece of legislation Is to take unemployed people and put them back to work. To do that. I think we have to open the opportunity and create the environment that the administrative responsibilities under this act will be borne by white collar employees presently unemployed. Now. this is not a matter without controversy and I do accept that as a reality. What I am suggesting today In putting a cap or a -ceiling on administrative salaries under this jobs bill of $29.000 is not .without precedent before this Congtess. Earlier this year the gentleman from Ohio offered. and I supported. the American Conservation Corps of 1983 legislation. Within that legislation we established that the rates of pay for supervisors. that is. crew leaders under that particular concept. would be limited to grades GS3 to GS7. about $10.000 to $20.000. What I have attempted to do with this legislation and the amendment I am offering is to provIde more flexibility. to -provide that any administrator paid in whole or in part under this bill would have a* limitation on his. or her Mr. PERKINS.

980162506,"Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to address one of the most pressing issues facing the countrythe Impact of defense spendIng on the economyIn a bipartisan effort. As Congress begins Its consideration of the fiscal year 1985 defense budget. we cannot ignore that the budget only perpetuates the existing imbalances within the defense budget between the development of new weapons systems and the maintenance of those we already have. If the Congress were to adopt the Presidents budget. we would be committing the country to the development of new weapons systems without sufficient resources either to staff or maintain them. For example. the Defense Department is seeking a 25percent increase in procurement funds for next year. but only a 15percent inerease for operations and maintenance and 9percent for personnel. Moreover. the share of the budget allocated to new weapons. research and military construction has risen from 37 percent in 1980 to 60 percent next. This shift in the spending allocations makes the defense budget that much more difficult to cut as Congress to clearly reluctant to stop the funding of weapon systems that have already commenced. Evidence of this imbalance is clear in the military today. After 8 years of the administrations unprecedented peacetime military buildup. all Americans must question the wisdom of our defense spending patterns when an Army major remarks that ""The Russians would much rather see the Army of 1980 coming down the road than the Army of today."" Further. following $632 billion of buildup. there are 25 percent fewer Army units certified as ready for combat than in 1980. A similar imbalance exista not only within the DOD budget. but also in spending allocations within the budget. I would agree that we need to insure a prudent defense for our country. However. I believe that the Administrations proposals are excessive and even harmful to the economy. Its fiscal year 1985 request is $48.1 billion higher than the fiscal year 1984 levela 13percent real increase. I the administration continues its defense spending as planned. spending levels will be 29 percent higher than in 1968. the peak year of the Vietnam war when 500.000 troops were engaged in combat. The Congress cannot cut even more funds from nondefense discretionary spending when 70 cents out of every dollar of discretionary spending already goes to defense. As deficits soar out of control. it is clear that we will have to make some cuts. despite Secretary Weinbergers claims to the contrary. It would be wise for the Defense Department to oeoperte with the Congress in offering advice on where those cuts can best be made. A third Imbalance created by our recent defense poliler is our trend toward a defense buildup on the one hand and the lack of progress in arms control talks on the other. At the present time. we are not engaged in any formal arms control talks with the Soviets. and feelings of mistrust and coldness are at their highest since the Cuban missile crisis. At the same time. we are engaged in our biggest peacetime military buildup. As Members of Congress. we cannot help but wonder if we are sending the wrong signal to the Soviets and the rest of the world. Although progress toward ironing out these Imbalances will be difficult to achieve in the coming months. I urge my colleagues to continue to work together in a bipartisan effort to make as much progress as possible.*"
980194520,Mr. Chairman. along with many of my colleagues. I have detailed the reasons for my opposition to this missile system. It is worthwhile to review the recent legislative history of this weapons system. The argument that persuaded enough Members to eke out a victory in last years fight on the MX was that the missile represented an important bargaining chip in arms control negotiations. Now that we are not engaged in any formal arms control talks with the So. viets. or even much informal contact. it is difficult to make that same argument in this years debate. However. this argument has resurfaced in a slightly different form. MX supporters contend that when we do resume arms control talks. the MX can be used as leverage. We have also heard the argument that canceling the MX will ease pressure on the Soviets to come back to the bargaining table. I am not persuaded by these points. A vote in favor of the MX last year has clearly done little to promote arms control talks. and there is little reason to think that the outcome will be any different this year. Another reason to oppose the MX has come to light over the past year. We have now begun to hear reports from the military about the growing imbalance in our combat capabilities as a result of the Presidents unprecedented peacetime military buildup. The military has documented many cases of its readiness problems. All of our Armed Forces reportedly lack enough ammunition for both training and prolonged combat. They lack spare parts for our planes and other weapons. they lack noncommissioned officers to provide vital frontline leadership. and they lack sufficient transport to get troops and material to where it is needed in times of war. All of this occurred while we were shattering spending records on our military budget. One of the mdjor reasons for these readiness problems under the Presidents military buildup is the emphasis on procurement of new weapons systems at the expense of the maintenance of our Armed Forces. As one example. the budget for ammunition. spare parts and other items in war reserve stockpiles has risen from $8.3 billion in 1981 to $10.8 billion in 1984which is a much slower rate of growth than that for weapons and equipment. With the MXs questionable strategic value and with its lack of success as a bargaining chip. it is one weapons system that can easily be eliminated from this year.s defense budget. Deletion of fiscal year 1985 production funds for the MX missile would both contribute to our effort to enforce budgetary restraint in all areas of Federal spending and encourage the efficient allocation of funds within the defense budget. I urge my colleagues to keep this in mind while casting their vote. Let us vote for a strong defense. but not for a wasteful and questionable missile system.*
980202283,Mr. Chairman. I would like to commend Mr. NICuoHs for preparing this legislation which shows that Members of Congress are truly concerned about eliminating waste. correcting system failures. and improving management deficiencies in the Government. The Democratic freshmen have been concentrating their efforts on identifying ways to control the high Federal deficits. When the Presidents Private Sector Survey on Cost Control. the Grace Commission. published its findings earlier this year. we were naturally interested in applying those recommendations that had been adequately investigated and reviewed. Nearly 2.500 recommendations were submitted. with claims that substantial savings could be achieved over a 3year period. The logistics of fully evalunting each recommendation. and each cost estimate necessarily takes more effort than a few months would allow. However. CHO and GAO pulled through with a joint analysis of the Grace Commissions recommendations in February. and identified areas where $98 billion could be saved over 3 years. Many Members of Congress have expressed their concern about the use of appropriated funds by the Department of Defense. Often times. DOD seems to function like a black hole: Its gravitational force pulls in funds which disappear in a fashion which is nearly impossible to trace. So. it does not seem at all surprising that the primary recommendations made by the Grace Commission for the DOD and each branch of our military services are to improve the weapons systems acquisition process and update inventory control. The trick is to translate these proposals into actions which are workable and effective. On this account. I would like to thank Mr. NIcHOLs and the efforts of his subcommittee in fully investigating the procurement of spare parts. and. in cooperation with our military services. pulling together measures which would be most cost effective The Grace Commission did its job of comparing and evaluating general alternatives for improving the acquisition processs. and the Armed Services Cominittee turned some of these suggestions into workable solutions. This measure not only incorporates the obJectives of the Grace Commission. it goes beyond the generalizedrecommendations of that report to identify specific and applicable forms. The armed services measure takes several direct steps to increase competition in the procurement of spare parts. It reflects the committees findings that one of the major causes of absurdly high prices charged for spare parts is the lack of effective competition In the procurement process. Some of the steps incorporated in this amendment to increase competition seem almost like commonsense to someone not familiar with the procurement process. For example. in the area of acquisition planning. the amendment requires that the Department of Defense check its own supply system inventory to see if the part it seeks is available. and at what price. before ordering it from a contractor. It also requires buyers to look at the record to see what prices were paid previously for the same item and to look at a picture and description of the part so they know what they are buying. While it does seem that DOD buyers would already be taking these steps. I think it is also easy to understand how they could be left aside. especially in the rush to get things done. or after many years of doing the same thing. Mr. NIcHoLs amendment recognizes this in incorporating these steps into law and in establishing competition advocates at each step in the procurement process to make sure they are enforced. Mr. NIcuoLs amendment makes several other effective changes in the procurement process. reflecting his subcommittees careful review of the problems involved with DODs procurement of space parts. I have heard countless expressions of outrage from my constituents about their tax dollars paying $1.118.26 for a plastic stool cap that they could have brought in their local hardware store for pennies. I share their outrage. and I believe that Mr. NIcHoLs amendment changes that process so that many abuses will be eliminated. Once again. I commend Mr. NICHOLS and his subcommittee for preparing this amendment. and I urge my colleagues to support it as an effective step toward eliminating waste in the procurement practices of the Department of Defense.
980221363,Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment of the gentleman from California. About 1 month ago Mr. Grace came and met with a number of freshman Democrats. He came in the room with six or eight aides. I do not know if that is a demonstration of efficiency. But he came armed with a statement to defend the Grace Commission report. We sat down with him and said that the statement was not necessary. What was necessary was for him to sit down and realize that Democrats and Republicans can both agree that waste. inefficiency. and the things that come from these two evils are things that people of both parties should agree have to be exterminated from the Federal budget. And we began working with the Grace Com. mission. I will readily concede that many of the proposals which Mr. Grace has made in his report are so controversial that they will never be enacted by this Congress. And I am also ready to concede that before the ink had driied on this report that the suggestions of Mr. Grace. many of them. had even been rejected by Secretary Weinberger. Director Stockman. and many people within the administration. But. ladies and gentlemen of the House. there are over 2.400 recommendations in this report. For us to take the attitude in Congress that because some are wrong or some are controversial or some are not going to be implemented that we should categorically reject the millions of manhours of work that have gone into this effort I think is a mistake. The Grace Commission recommendations being made by the gentleman from California I believe are reasonable. They represent a small amount of money. threetenths of 1 percent of this appropriation. It is not the amount of money that Is important. What is Important I think is that we are ready to open up the doors on this process and look for some new Ideas. The savings will require some administrative changes. I believe the chairman has rightfully pointed out that the budget Is not being cut on its face. But we are directing those who administer these budgets to make changes to be more efficient and to save the taxpayers dollars. There indirect savings are just as good as any direct savings and I believe the gentleman from California will accomplish these with his recommendations. There are a dozen reasons not to vote for this amendment.. The President is against it. Director Stockman is against it. Many people involved in the committees on Capitol Hill are against it. But there is one very good reason to vote for this amendment. We will demonstrate that we on the inside are ready to listen to those on the outside who take a critical look at this process and this budget process. I would like to commend the gentleman from California. and I would like to state publicly that having worked with his staff I know that he has diminished the projected savings on these amendments to a point that is realistic. We could easily overstate what might be saved. but he has diminished it to a point where I think this House should accept the amendmerit.
980227807,"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the last word. I rise in support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman. this amendment which has been offered by the gentleman from Arizona Is one which I hope the House will consider and pass this evening. I think it is an important amendment. What we are doing here should not disparage the efforts that have already been made by this committee. I believe they deserve praise for an effort to try to right the imbalance which presently exists in relation to the recoupment of prefinancing funds for NATO expenditures. And yet. the case is very clear. In 1983 during a meeting of this Appropriations Committee. Mr. Robert Lanoue. Director of the NATO Foreign Programs Office. advised this committee that at that moment the NATO allies owed the United States $265 million in money that we had given to those allies in prefinancing for construction of projects which we considered to be mutually acceptable and mutually necessary. At that time the chairman of this committee asked Mr. Lanoue why it took so long for us to recoup these dollar amounts when they had already been deemed eligible in terms of the NATO allies. Another NATO associate witness offered the reply that there was a priority system in NATO according to a project and he explained that If the NATO allies have a priority that is more important than paying back the United States. then they will go forward with that particular priority. whether it is the contruction of an air""raft shelter or whatever it might be. Mr. Chairman. the suggestion is that we should wait in line. wait in line for money that we have already extended to the NATO allies for iutually necessary projects and w- jhould stand back at a time when we are trying to count the dollars that apply to our spending and to our efforts to reduce the deficit and we should stand back and accept the fact that the Department of Defense told us last year that out of the $265 million owed to the United States. they could recoup $40 million from the NATO allies. They missed that figure by a mile. They came in with $12 million. The amendment being offered by the gentleman from Arizona holds the Department of Defense to the same standard that they asked to be held to last year. come up wit~h the $28 million for the NATO allies. In response to the gentleman from Ohio. I do not think the choice is between staying with NATO or withdrawing from NATO. The choice is in communicating to NATO and our allies. an important alliance for the United States. that we are very serious in our need for revenue in this country as well. that their burden that must be shared is one that includes a burden of coming up with money that we were at least kind enough or sensitive enough to extend to them by way of prefinancing. To the gentleman from North Carolina. I would suggest that I believe that efforts have been made to suggest to the NATO allies that we are serioils. This amendment being offered by the gentleman from Arizona makes that tone and that approach one that I think the NATO allies cannot escape from realizing and has to be considered In the very near future. The suggestion that we would get an additional $28 million through the NATO allies in this year is one which Is not only good for the United States. but ultimately good for the alliance."
980232074,Mr. Chairman. the water resources authorization bill contains many provisions that are important to our Nation and one that is particularly important to the people of western Illinois. This provision clarifies the Army Corps of Engineers policy in regard to terminating campsite leases along the Mississippi River. Since coming to Congress some 18 months ago. I have had the opportunity to meet with and work with a group of concerned citizens who have joined together to form the Two Rivers Campsite Preservation Coalition. These are not. wealthy nor powerful people. but rather individuals who have been cuwrgized by a common concern for fair treatment. They have worked with Members of Congress along both sides of the Mississippi River in seeking their goal. and their campaign has been marked by reason and commonisense. At issue here and addressed by this bill is a policy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that calls for the termination of campsite leases along t he Mississippi River. More than 2.000 families now hold camipsite leases along the river. These are people who gained these leases back in the 1950s when the corps was encouraging this mild form of development on the public land that adjoins the river. Those who hold these campsite leases are individuals who love the outdoors. There are no expensive homes on these sites nor commercial ventures. These are simple vacation and weekend retreats for those who enjoy time spent along this beautiful river. Leaseholders. by their presence. have also provided a degree of security and aid for those who use the river. The provision in this bill that affects the leaseholders simply states that the Corps of Engineers cannot terminate these leases unless a higher priority use is shown for the land. such as a park development. or use in a flood control or navigation project. This will provide the current leaseholders with assurance that they will not be tossed off the land. When the Government sought people to use the riverfront to provide a small degree of development. these individuals responded. I do not think this measure of clarification is too much for them to seek in return.*
980236747,Mr. Chairman. the bill which we are considering today H.R. 5151 attempts to balance the benefit needs of food stamp recipients with the desire to maintain a cost effective system. On the one hand. I think we all agree that assisting the truly needy is worthy and that we can be proud of the Food Stamp Program in this regard. However. on the other hand. I think most of us also agree that. to the greatest extent possible. we should guarantee that the funds allocated to this program are well nionitored and responsibly managed. The burden of record keeping. quality control. and general administration of the Food Stamp Program falls on the States. The States are required undcr the Food Stamp Act to have quality control systems to identify the types of errors being made and to quantify the losses attributable to each type. This has been required since fiscal 1981. with error rate resuits compiled and reported for 6month periods. Payments to ineligible persons are monitored to provide information for devising corrective actions to reduce erroneously issued benefits. They also serve as the basis for establishing State or Federal financial liability for excessively erroneous payments. Managers in private Industry have long employed quality control systems to help assure that services meet certain standards. This systematic means to assist businesses. If applied to the Food Stamp Program. should help State and local administrators monitor and control the accuracy of payments to program clients. I know the State of Illinois Is grateful for the quality control program. The Department of Agricultures Food and Nutrition Service uses a corrective action process to encourage States to solve program problems. The States are required to make reviews to identify problems in State and local operations and to develop and implement corrective plans. This Involves setting target dates and measuring changes in overissuances or payments to ineligible persons. Among the major problems have been certification errors in determining eligibility and benefits. Holding States accountable for their Food Stamp Program deficiencies has made States put more emphasis on carrying out corrective actions. The prospect of losing some Federal funds has prompted some top level State and local officials to give increased attention to improving their programs. Perhaps even more of an incentive. according to a GAO report of May 30. 1984. has been the adverse publicity which accompanies any sanctions issued against States for high error rates. H.R. 5151 increases the sanctions against States for error in determining and distributing benefit payments. Currently. States are sanctioned at 5 percent of their federally funded administrative costs for each percentage point their rate exceeds 9 percent for fiscal 1983. 7 percent for fiscal 1984. and 5 percent for fiscal 1985. This bill provides that sanctions would be based on total issuances rather than administrative costs. making States liable for the full value of overissued food stamp benefits beyond a 5percent error threshhold. States have justifiably opposed this measure. since it could more than double the average financial penalty States would have to pay for errors after fiscal year 1985. Although I think this is a severe measure. it is a strong statement of congressional concern about quality control in the Food Stamp Program. Nonetheless. if we are sincerely concerned about assurances that the benefits of this program reach the truly needy. the use of penalties will solve only part of the problem. What really needs to be addressed is the quality control mechanism. And. as the recent GAO report points out. each State has its own set of problems and corrective action plans must be designed to address the particular set of circumstances for each particular State. Therefore. the Federal regulations must allow a wide range of options in solving their overpayment problems. I believe that provision in this bill which makes mandatory reporting and retrospective accounting optional is necessary in light of these stringent error rate requirements. Too frequently States are charged with not caring how they handle Federal money. And. the adverse publicity which accompanies even one finding of fraud in the food stamp program deepens this perception. Perhaps some States are sloppy with Federal funds. perhaps some of them dont have the necessary information and management systems to adequately monitor this program. But most of the States have made great progress over the past 3 years. Illinois has improved its error rate by 40 percent and the agencycaused budgeting errors dropped 75 percent. However. Illinois has indicated that monthly reporting and retrospective budgeting does not help quality control. Results from a demonstration project showed that payment error rates were about the same in both the conventional and monthly reporting groups. contrary to expectations. Unfortunately. the current law makes monthly reporting mandatory. even though in Illinois they found that it led to increased costs due to accompanying paperwork and it was less responsible to recipient needs. If we are going to penalize the States for errors. we should allow them to choose the tools which will help them to bring down their error rates. This bill will permit States to determine whether or not monthly reporting and retrospective budgeting will decrease overissuances. Any attempt to remove this section of the July) J7. 1984 II17984 legislation will just make it harder for States to provide the best service pos. sible to food stamp recipients. Rather than increasing the regulations binding the administration of this program. the Federal Government must Improve Its quality control assistance efforts. States dont need more requirements. they need assistance with quality control reviews. access to better information processing equipment. fraud detection systems. and worker education. During the Agriculture Committee markup of this bill. Members discussed this problem at length. I think there was a general concensus that the qualIty control system could be improved and that the error rate calculations have not been adequately defined. Therefore. the committee approved an amendment I offerqd to H.R. 5151. which requires a report from 1le Secretary by April 1. 1985. about the quality control system effectiveness and the methods used for calculating the error rates. I have received assurances from the chairman of the subcommittee. the author of this bill. that prior to reauthorization of the Food Stamp Program next year. we will gather information from the States. the Federal Government. and other involved parties as to the efficacy of the current quality control system. le has agreed to further debate about the error rate system. and I think that any actions taken next year will be based on the best information possible. But. for now we need to pass H.R. 5151. This bill will increase the benefits by changing the formula for the cost of the thrifty food plan. It streamlines the eligibility process by making households with AFDC or SSI recipients automatically eligible. It raises the deductions for earned Income as a work incentive. It repeals mandatory monthly reporting and retrospective accounting. The Food Stamp Program operation is vital. The program has continued to provide food assistance to the Nations needy since it was established by the Food Stamp Act in 1984. 1 think we have suffered sonic set backs in this program over the past few years. but this bill helps to overcome sonic of these deficiencies. I agree that there are some problems. especially in regards to sanctions against States. but I also think that these will be successfully addressed at another time. This is a bipartisan effort: lets keep it intact.g
980239827,Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. today this House will vote on the future of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. and whatever the outcome. Synfuels will be chastened by this congressional review. as well it should be. A clear and convincing case of mismanagement has been made. The administration which now seeks to wash its hands of synthetic fuels must be held accountable for one of the worst records of Federal appointment in modern memory. Credit must be given to my colleagues. the gentleman from Massachusetts. Congressman CONTE. the gentleman from Michigan. HOWARD WOLPE. and the gentleman from Oklahoma. MIKE SYNAR. for their diligent review of Synfuels which has guaranteed to this Nation a full accounting of the stewardship of this agency. I listened very closely to the arguments just made by the gentleman from North Carolina and the colloquy on the floor about the market competitiveness of the various projects that are being considered by Synthetic Fuels. I was not a Member of the Congress when the Synthetic Fuels Corporation was created. but it appears to me that if this agency was created and given the tools of loan guarantees and price supports. then it was certainly created with the notion that the products that were to be produced from this process would not be market competitive immediately. The idea behind this agency was to provide some Government assistance to this production capability so that in the long term and medium term those products which we will need in this country would be available. I would urge m colleagues as they vent their frustrations over the lackluster record of this agency that their zeal be tempered. A $10 billion cut does more than punish this agency for past mistakes. A $10 billion cut closes the door on the future of our national commitment to energy independence. Attempting to kill any specific projects by enacting a $10 billion rescission will also mean killing. among other things. a Midwestern coal project which would bring thousands of jobs to a depressed area and new hope to a struggling coal industry. Coal brought immigrants into my part of the world. and settled many fine communities in my district. But today. most of the mines are closed. The coal is there still in incredible abundance. In fact. onethird of the national reserve of coal is located in the State of Illinois. But the threats of acid rain and the world energy demands have resulted in many of these coal communities becoming ghost towns. With the $10 billion cut that is being suggested today by the ConteWolpe amendment. the hope of this new Midwestern coal gasification facility will die aborning. Turning the lights out at Synfuels today may cripple our national synfuel industry for years to come. Companies which have spent years preparing applications and millions of dollars will see that there is no evidence that this agency is viable or reliable in the future. Can we expect any private group if we cut $10 billion today to make a dollar commitment to a project down the line? I think not. Let us not leave this Chamber beaming with the political victory of cutting $10 billion and expose tomorrows Americans to the threat of an OPEC blackmail. Let us not leave this Chamber today flush with the feeling of retribution and destroy promising energy Auigust 2.1984 August 2. 1984 CIop resources which our children may need to survive in this troubled world. I urge my colleagues to vote yes for the RatchfordMcDade amendment and no on the ConteWolpe amendment.

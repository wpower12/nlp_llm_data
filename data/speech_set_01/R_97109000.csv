970019525,Mr. Speaker. I am greatly disturbed by the administrations announced intention to sell Saudi Arabia conformal fuel tanks and advanced Sidewinder airtoair missiles for its F15 fighters. Such sophisticated equipment will greatly increase the firepower and range of the F15s. The Saudi request. if granted. could undermine significantly Israels ability to defend itself. Mr. Speaker. it is undeniable that the Saudi rulers continue to see Israel as a principal adversary. As recently as last month. Saudi officials called for a holy war against Israel. Three times in the past 30 years Saudi Armed Forces have been employed against Israel. Saudi Arabia has led the Arab League condemnation of the Camp David accords. has broken diplomatic relations with and withheld economic support to Egypt. and has steadfastly refused American proposals to participate in the peace talks. Moreover. it has increased its financial and diplomatic support for the Palestine Liberation Organization. In short. Saudi Arabia has played anything but a constructive role in the search for a lasting peace in the Middle East. Ostensibly this sale will contribute to American security interests in the Persian Gulf by providing the Saudi Air Force with greater deterrent capability against a Soviet thrust in the region. But 62 F15s. sophisticated and formidable as they are. would be incapable of blunting a determined Soviet attack on Saudi oilfields or on the Straits of Hormuz. The more immediate threat to the region stems from Soviet forces in *-Afghanistan. which pose a direct threat to Pakistan and Iran. not Saudi Arabia. Given the instability of the region. one cannot discount the possibility that this highly sophisticated U.S. equipment could fall into the wrong hands. thus compromising American military secrets. if the sale goes. forward. In particular. the stability of the current Saudi regime is not very reassuring. The takeover of the Grand Mosque in the fall of 1979 is only one indication of the vulnerability of the Saudi ruling family. The principal advantage Saudi Arabia will gain by the augmentation of its F15 squadrons is directed against Israel. Mr. Speaker. This is why the proposed sale worries me so greatly and why I believe it is ill advised. Extending the range of the F15s from 450 miles to 1.000 miles will enable Saudi Arabia to launch attacks from deep within its territory against any target in Israel. with more devastating force than the Saudis now possess. Judging frcm past behavior. I would not expect the Saudis to act alone. but in concert with other Arab nations in a coordinated attack on a broad front. Quite obviously. precision attacks by heavily armed. longrange Saudi F15s would severely complicate Israeli defense efforts. Mr. Speaker. I find it very disturbing that there has.been no quid pro quo from Saudi Arabia in response to U.S. willingness to bolster its security. In .fact. since the initial sale of F15s received congressional approval in 1978. Saudi actions have illustrated belligerence. Indeed. oil blackmail has played. and continues to play. a prominent role in Saudi foreign policy. After the 1978 sale. for example. Saudi Arabia put considerable pressure on the United States not to build its strategic oil reserve. and threatened to cut back production if the warning was disregarded. Recent statements by Saudi oil minister Sheik Yamani indicate that Saudi moderation of oil prices is designated to reduce incentives to search for petroleum substitutes. thereby prolonging U.S. dependence on Saudi Arabian oil. In light of Saudi Arabias statements and actions. one is entitled to the conclusion that it holds no special regard for the United States. This is not surprising given the differences in history. religion. culture. and political traditions of the two countries. But the United States and Israel do have a special relationship. tied as we are by religious. cultural. and political values and traditions. Let us not forget that Israel is the only proWestern demo. cratic nation in the Middle East. Its security must be of paramount and overriding importance to U.S. objectives in the region. It is proper to enhance the security of other Middle East countries who. are opposed to Soviet expansion. but not to the extent that Israels security is thereby complicated if compromised. I join my colleagues in opposing this sale.e
970026430,"Mr. Chairman. one of the questions that we hear more and more. as people realize the extent of our financial problems. Is ""Why? What happened? Why are we In this mess?"" The answer to that Is the reason the country is Insisting we pass the Reaga!L program.. The American economy Is overregulated and undernourished. In the last 10 years. business Investment has dropped nearly 400 percent. Productivity Increases. the lifeblood of. the. modern economy. have declined to the point where actual economic growth has become more a fading memory than an actual occurrence. For the last 4 years.. taxes have gone up an average of-$610 every year for each May 7. 1.981 working man and womanin this countryl The explosive growth in the- size of the Federal Government has reached a point where that Government consumes. In an average year. 21 percent of t .his Nations wealth. American businesses that want to modernize or expand have to compete for an eversmaller supply of capital. In 1955. the Federal Government consumed only 5 percent of the total available credit In this country: today. the Government consumes more than 23 percent of all available credit. driving up the cost of money and decreasing the amount that Is available -4or businesses to expand and create niw Jobs. Malnourishment leads to starvation. and It Is said that a starving man dies by inches. The most sinister and deadly effect of our -malnotirished economy Is the slow starvation of the American dream. Slowly. by Inches. that dream is disappearing. You know the dreamnthe ""only In America"" dreamthe dream of opportunity. of a chance to get ahead. to own your own home. to educate your children. to retire someday instead of working until you drop .dead Ain your- tracks bent over some machine. Today. all these dreamsretirement. education. owning your own homeare becoming more and more distant. Last year. the savings rate in this country was at the lowest point since World War II. there Is barely enough money to pay bills. and nothing left to save. nothing left to build a nest egg. or put aside a downipayment. And so fewer people. especially young people. can buy a home. And because the money was not put in savings. and because fewer people are Investing. there is no money for builders to borrow to. build the homes that people cannot afford to buy. We know the answer to the question of ""What happened and why."" The answer is all around us. We see it in the lines at the employment office. we see in the faces of the young. who are losing hope of owning their own home. The question before us now. is: Are we. going to settle for more of the same or will we accept the mandate of the voters of thid country and restore to all Americans the -promise of the American dream before it too becomes little more than a fading memory? In the past several years. the. response to this question has )een promises of ""responsible budgets. ""sound"" budgets. ""prudenit"" budgets. and ""austere"" budgets. What we have gotten are record Inflation rates. record unemployment. record interest rates. and record deficits.. This year. the Budget Committee has come up with more of the same. There is only. one comprehensive program that addresses the problem. we face. That is the Reagan program as presented in the bipartisan substitute. This proposal embraces. all the components of the Presidents Program for Economy Recovery. This proposal Is designed to eliminate the"" obstacles to a prosperous economy. The reduction in thesize of the Federal budget will free up resources to allow business to expand and create new jobs. The reduction in tax rates will put money In the hands of the people. instead of in the hands of the Government. This will allow people to build a nest egg. to save for their childrens education and to begin to save for a home. These policies. together with a policy of regulatory reform and restraint on the growth of money will free us from the crippling burden of high interest rates. high inflation rates and high unemployment. The question is asked: How do we know this program will work? Mr. Chairman.. there is one thing we do know. The political economies of the past 40 years has not worked. This program seeks to nourish the dream we all share. To accept anything less would be a denial of the promise of that dream to all Americans."
970036289,"Editor. U.S. News and World Report. Washington. D.C. DEAR MARVIN: Your thoughtful editorial. ""Three Billion Well Spent"" in the June 1 edition of. U.S. News and World Report. is valid. This Nation needs secure domestic supplies of. fuel. Your words concerning the possibility of upcoming foreign supply Interruptions because of renewed Mideast conflict are accurate. Such beliefs were also accurate in 1943 and in 1961. I spoke then in the House of Representatives and before the Senate Interior Committee emphasizing that. ""every year that passes in which we become more and move dependent on foreign oil to buttress our economy and security perhaps is one year nearer to disaster. We are gambling with our countrys future."" The concept of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve highlights our national preoccupation with minimizing the shortterm effects of inadequate domestic energy supplies while failing to forge a policy to solve longer term problems. Recognizing this fact. t!e Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act of 1944 was introduced and passed during the Roosevelt Administration. This legislation mandated development of new technology to produce ethanol. methanol and other liquid fuels from coal. oil shale. and agricultural products. In 1955. the decision was made by the then current Administration to eliminate all government -participation in alternate synthetic fuels projects. The assumption was that if needed. private industry would anticipate and respond that the country have adequate fuel supplies. If we had continued government support for synthetic fuels initiated in the early forties. as in my bill. we would have realized domestic commercial production today. When the Strategic Petroleum Reserve concept was acted on in 1975 I refused to support that shortterm effort until we had developed. as a first priority. legislation we could use to recreate a synthetic fuels industry in the United States and establ1sh complete energy independence. Passage of the Energy Security Act of 1980 sent the message to OPEO that we again were encouraging the construction of synthetto fuel plants. not only through subsidy support where needed to assure early commericialization. but through protection against unwarranted regulation and inflationary impacts. It also signaled domestic energy industries that we were asking for immediate action on synthetic fuels by allowing the President to initiate necessary activities to reach this goal under the Defense Producton Act of 1950 while the Synthetic Fuels Corporation was being organized. It is important now that we do not take a step backward in our longterm national commitment to synthetic fuels. The President must appoint the final two members of the Corporation Board and provide personal leadership in the activities of the organization to guarantee its vitality. If these steps are taken by he new Administration on synthetic fuel dci.Iopment. full funding of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be a necessary and correct secondary step to take. Filling the oil reserve will guard against supply Interruptions while our synfuels capacity is being ccstructed. We. however. can not use funds set aside for synthetic fuel development to pu chase foreign oil. To borrow three billion dollars from appropriations for the Synthetic Fuela Corporation would erode public confidence In the governments ability to establish and consistently pursue policies to assure eventual and permanent energy Independence. Such a funding scheme would be unacceptable. A coordinated and balanced program en. couraging an oil reserve and synthetic fuels industry wil serve our Nation well. Neither are subsidies. but are investments for our future generations. Truly."
970078887,Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman. sitting on my desk. In my office. Is an amendment to the State Department authorization bill which would require the Secretary of State to reduce funding to the United Nations organizations If the United States is denied a seat we traditionally have held on a U.N. board. committee. or commission. I will not introduce that amendment today. but I do want to serve notice that If we continue to let opposing nations to direct the course of U.N. policy against our best Interests. I will work very hard to reduce. If not eliminate. our contributions to the various U.N. organizations. Ostensibly. we belong to the United Nations because Its goals enhance our foreign policy goals. however. increasingly. U.N. bodies are being exploited to promote programs and activities that are inimical to the Interests of the United States and our Western allies. There are many examples of this. In an episode that is without precedent. the United States last spring was denied. for the first time ever.. a seat on the United Nations Statistical Commission. which establishes guidelines for gathering statistical data used by other agencies. In accordance with a longstanding tradition. permnanent members of the Security Council are routinely represented on this and several other commissions. By secret vote. however. the Economic and Social Council removed the United States from the Commission. Thus. the opportunity for the United States to influence the policies of the Statistical Commission has been greatly diminished. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick has said she believes the vote was orchestrated by a group of Third World nations bent on taking a slap at certain U.S. policiesespecially our insistence that Israel be treated In a manner consistent with the U.N.s formal rules of procedure. This action establishes a precedent which should not go unnoticed by American taxpayers. who contribute 25 percent of the U.N. budgetmore than twice the amount paid by any other nationor by this Congress. which should insist that the funds we appropriate for foreign affairs In these lean years by used only to enhance our foreign policy goals. In another ominous move. the United Nations Educational. Scientiflc. and Cultural Organization Is embarked on a scheme to regulate news content and to control press conduct around the world. The plan Is an essential part of UNESCOs promotion of the new world information order. which Is hailed by its proponentsprincipally the Soviet Union and its Third World alliesas a systematic effort to insure socalled balanced dissemination of news and information around the world. Apart from the absurdity of entrustIng a body as political as UNESCO with formulating rules and regulations for the worlds news media. the very notion smacks of censorship and conjures up the prospect of an Orwellian Big Brother which is contrary to our concepts as embodied in the first amendment and going back to John Peter Zengers trial. It Is no wonder that representatives of major news organizations In some 20 countries met in France to condemn the proposal as a dangerous encroachment on press freedom. Unfortunately. the strong opposition from the media and many Western governments has not dissuaded UNESCO from going forward with plans to Implement the proposal. Taking swipes at Israel is another favorite exercise in the United Nations. Last spring. a bloc of Arab and African nations attempted to have Israel disinvited to an international conference aiding African refugees after a formal Invitation had been extended by the conference organizers and accepted by Israel. Only when the United States threatened to boycott the conference was Israel finally allowed to attend. A group that is particularly adept at using the United Nations for purposes in opposition to the United States best interests is the Palestine Liberation Organization. Not content with its status as an observer. the PLO has repeatedly sought to take part In U.N. activities. especially in the Security Council. as though it were a fullfledged member nation. Rule 37 of the Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council applies to nations who are members of the U.N. but not of the Secuirity Council. Rule 39 applies to interested parties who do not enjoy U.N. membership. For several years. the PLO has attempted to gain access to the Security Council by way of rule 37. The PLO Is attempting to do. behind the barn. what peaceloving nations have not allowed out front. That terrorist organization Is attempting to gain recognition as a legitimate government. Unfortunately. U.S. opposition to the use of rule 37 by the PLO is Ineffective as most other Western nations on the Security Council abstain on votes to allow the PLO access to the Security Council under this rule. Mr. Chairman. I could recite other examples of actions taken in opposition to our expressed foreign policy and In attempts to prevent our influence. but the recitation would be so long that it would bore the Chamber. The point Is that the United States Is losingif it has not lost alreadsits efficacy in promoting American foreign policy goals through the United Nations. Increasingly. the dollars we give to the United Nations underwrite organizations which subvert or circumvent our foreign policy goals. If this continues. 1. for one. will move to significantly reduce our funding for the United Nations.
970102482,"Mr. Speaker. right now. more than 35 million Americans are receiving social security payments. One in every two Americans are contributing to that system with the expectation of receivIng the benefits that will have been earned over a lifetime of work. Unfortunately. those expectations will. be destroyed unless Congress can effect some changes in the system that bill restore Its solvency. and more importantly. provide the benefits which have been promised to all who *have worked so hard to earn them. The system is In. a state of crisis. That crisis has been~ precipitated by a number of changes that have occurred over the lifetime of the system. since 1956. basic benefits have been enlarged to Include disability pensions. survivor benefits. and student benefits. In addition. the benefit level was indexed to the CPI in 1972. No one would argue that any of these changes are Intrinsically bad. But it Is clear that these changes. coupled with the changing demographics of this country have strained the system far beyond Its original design. In 1950. the system has 12 years worth of benefits in present. at 1950 level of payments. In 1980. that reserve level had dropped to 3 months. and Is still dropping. If the level of reserves dips below 1 month. there will be no social security checks forthcomIng to the millions who have earned them and depend on them for survival. The system was never designed to cope with an economy that would suffer prolonged periods of both Inflation and unemployment. Since over 90 percent of the income. and therefore outgo. of the system is geared to current payroll taxes. and. since the benefits are geared to the CPI. a high inflationary and high unemployment economy produce a near fatal result. Mr. Speaker. as deeply concerned as I am over the fate of the social security system. I am more concerned over the actions of the members of the Democratic Party who have tried to use the crisis for political gain. The Democratic National Committee recently sent a fundraising letter out which was disguised as an official announcement concerning social security. that letter attacked the administration as being opposed to social security and aiming at Its destruction. That letter represented fearmongerIng at its worst. there are millions of people in this country for whom a brown envelope bearing the words ""Social Security"" represents not only a lifetime work. but their only source -of income. To send a fundraising letter In the guise of an official notice and to scape people Into contributing to a political party Is a tactic more in line with a loan shark than a responsible political party. Mr. Speaker. as I have already stated. the social security system was never designed to cope with an Inflationary economy suffering from high unemployment. It Is your party. Mr. Speaker. that has controlled a Congress for 25 years that has run our economy Into the ground. We have had a never ending string of deficits and rising taxes. It Is your party- that has helped precipitate the crisis In the social security system. And your response to this crisis Is to point an accusing finger and blame anyone but yourself. The President had called for a bipartisan effort to solve this problem. I call on you. Mr. Speaker. and members of your party. to stop playing with lives of millions of people who depend on social security and join us in a serious effort to Insure that the promises made to the American people will be honored.*"
970106445,"Mr. Speaker. for the past several weeks. I have been watching an absolutely amazing phenomenon. Those very same people who have continued over the years to insist on deficit spending. and who have ridiculed our concern about the growing national debt and our simplistic demands for balanced budgets. now think that they can simply throw up their hands and walk away from the mess they created. The big spenders are trying to pin the blame for the Nations economic problems on the man who came In and pulled the plug on their candy mountain money dispensing machine. These new champions of the balanced budget. who created the massive Federal debt and added to It with huge deficits every year. now complain that the deficit for the coming year Is simply too high: These advocates of fiscal restraint. who year after year bottled up. derailed. or defeated attempts to balance the budget. now accuse the President of not balancing the budget fast enough. If one believes the statements coming out of the offices of majority members these days. we have great new champions of fiscal responsibility and hardcore budget balancingthe very same people who. In the past 10 years have tripled the size of the national debt. tripled the size of the annual budget. and tripled the amount of money the Federal Government takes In taxes. I do not question the urgency of this newly found concern for fiscal responsibility. Landslide elections iiave a tendency to make elected officials reexamine certain issues. especially If they are on the downhill side of that slide. But the truth Is. the President and the new conservative coalition In the Congress have made tremendous strides toward cutting back on the size of the Federal Government. moving. for the first time. toward smaller deficits and a balanced budget. and opening the door for new economic opportunity. Mr. Speaker. let me remind you and the American people what brought about the events of the last 10 months. and what would have been In store for us had Ronald Reagan not been in the White House for the last 10 months. In the last 20 years there has been an alarming deterioration in the vitality and capacity of the American economy. Economic. growth declined from an average of 4.7 percent a year for the 10year period ending in 1969 to a dismal 2.5 percent over the next 10 years. Total real business investment actually declined by 71 percent. Productivity actually declined. The savings rate. the source of new venture capital and ultimately. new. jobs. dropped to an alltime low. These changes in the American economy did not occur in a vacuum. The policies initiated and continued by. this Congressby the people who have controlled this Congress for the last 215 yearscaused these problems. ivir. Speaker. Ronald Reagans proram has Just now gone into effect. The results will not be felt for another 6 months. This economy is the product of Jimmy Carter. Tip ONEILL. JIM WRIGHT. and ROBERT BYRD. It Is your economy. Mr. Speaker. It Is your mess. To blame it on the President is like blaming the Chicago fire on the fire department. And it assumes that the American people are either stupid or have very short memories. In 1950. at the beginning of a war. the Federal Government consumed only 5 percent of the available credit In the market. Now. in. peacetime. the Government consumes more than onefourth of the available credit. The Government uses up the new capital that Is so necessary for businesses to expand and create new Jobs. Why? Except for 1 year. this Congress. your Congress. Mr. Speaker. has had an unbroken string of deficits from 1958 onward. while the Government was amassing a trillion dollar national debt. Yes. Mr. Speaker. President Reagan Is In office now and he had to ask for a new debt ceiling. but It Is your debtit is your partys debtto pay for the programs you enacted over his opposition and my opposition and the opposition of everybody who thought before the Reagan landslide that we needed to reduce Federal spending and balance the budget. The last administration. your administration. in concert with the Democratic Congress. promised austere budgets and what we got was an unbroken string of everincreasing debt capped* by 2 years of near record backtoback deficits of $60 billion while taxes were increasing by almost $100 billion a year. In the 96th Congress. there were close to 200 individual pieces of legislation Introduced that would put bindIng limits on the ability of the Congress to overspend. Not one of these got as far as a full committee hearing. They were killed by. your party. -Mr. Speaker. by the leadership in this Housethe same leadership that now extols the virtues of balanced budgets. In September (if 1979. the gentleman from Ohio offered a subfititute to the committee budgeta substitute that would have reduced oudtlays by $19 billion. It did not- have a prayer. The budget passed by your ""balanced budget"" choir gave us a whopping $60 billion deficit that year. The next year. he tried againthis time to cut $16 billion out of .the budget. Your party defeated that attempt. too. The House leadership has Ifought against every reduction in the Federal budget. Now that the changes are law. the leadership has suddenly recognized the virtue of balancing the budget and attacks the President for not balancing it fast enough. attemptIng to blame the President for the Federal deficit. Suddenly. the massive debt service Incorporated In the 1982 budget to pay your spending has become Ronald Reagans fault. In the 10year period. from 1971 to 1981. Mr. Speaker. your whims and the whims of your party skyrocketed the national debt from Just over $300 billion to nearly a trillion dollars. Who said there Is no such thing as a free lunch. Mr. Speaker. Democrats have been at the public trough for a quarter century and now the Reagan administration has to clean up your mess and you have the gall. the hypocrisy. the chutzpah to blame him for it. We have 20 percent interest rates because the Federal Reserve Board and the business community have lost all faith in this Congress to control spending. Mr. Speaker. there are thousands of American businesses on the verge of bankruptcy. farmers are unable to meet their bank notes. homebuilders cannot build and home buyers cannot buy. Taxes are high. interest rates are highand that is a Jimmy Carter. Tip ONEIuL. ROBERT BYRD. Democrat economy. * Your party created this mess and It Is pure hypocrisy to try to lay it at somebody elses feet. Enough Is enough. We are -all familiar with the classic definition of chutzpah: The child who murders his parents and then throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan. Well. If anybody in this world has chutzpah. its the Democratic leadership in this Congresspeople who have spent their entire congressional careers arguing against the very concept of the balanced budget. When politics forced them to at least give lip service to the public demand for a balanced budget. they denied that it was possible. When It became politically difficult to say even that. they pleaded. throughout the Carter Presidency. for more time. claiming the 4 years was Just not enough time. Now these same people. who certainly have more chutzpah than anybody in my memory. attack the President for not being able to guarantee. with absolute certainty. a balanced budget by a target date. for not being able to immediately eliminate the great deficits they themselves thought necessary. for the deficits they .created against his opposition. It is the same baldfaced. say anything .hypocrisy that allowed the Democratic leadership to wash Its hands. like Pontius Pilate. and blame the economic mess they created on the President even before his own program took effect. Well. Mr. Speaker. this Is your economy. you created It. you have fought to block every attempt to reduce spending and balance the budget. and I assure you. the American people will not forget."
970127440,"Mr. Chairman. this Is not an easy moment for me. I believe In. this amendment with all my heart. but It Is not easy for me to oppose this President. I have worked with him for a year. I1 have voted with him for a year consistently. I stood In the snow In New Hampshire and I campaigned for him when my hands were so cold I could not hold a cup of coffee. and my mouth Was so cold I could not talk. - Mr. Chairman. I believe. In Ronald. Reagan. and I would not be here today If I did not believe. with all my heart that this time. this one time. I Just cannot go Along. This is not a minor amendment. and it Is notnoncontroversial. It Is. not going to sneak. by. This Is an amendment to reduce the appropriation for the International Development Association from $850 million to $520 millon. It Is an amendment to save the taxpayers nearly a third of a billion dollars without taking away a Single educational loan or a single food stamp. * Mr. Chairman. I think the Congress has to pass. this amendment. I think we have to. pass this amendment for two reasons: One. because of equity. *and one because of a very necessary change In the direction of American foreign policy. Since World War II. foreign assistance has been a significant part of Americas foreign policy. and I would not stand here and try to tell. the Members of this House that there Is no role for American foreign aid programs. There Is a role. There Is a role because sometimes our assistance to smnall frontline Third World countries may help prevent those countries from being dominated politically. economically. or militarily by the Soviet Union. and to that extent the money spent on foreign assistance is money spent for our own national security Interest. And that Is true whether it Is military assistance or economic assistance. Sometimes. Mr. Chairman. there is another reason why It Is right for American taxpayers to dig into their pockets to - help people In another. country. and that is to meet our very basic commitment to humanitarian needs. That Is why we operate programs to take care of people who suffer from famine or flood or earthquake. So. Mr. Chairman. I do not maintain at all that foreign assistance Is inh~rently wrong. If we are to -be a global power. then the United States nieeds a carefully structured. carefully adinistered. bilateral direct foreign assistance program. What we do not need is to pour hundreds of millions of American dollars into multilateral organizatioris which we do not control. over which we have precious little influence. and which use enormous chunks of American money to benefit greedy nations which suck us dry and consistently oppose American foreign policy. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund lend American money to other nations at reduced Interest rates. But they do charge Interest. and those loans are repaid. I am not asking you today to pull out of the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. but there Is another part of the. multilateral development system for which I can find no rational claim on American dollars. and I am talking about IDAthe International Development Associationthe soft loan window of the World Bank. -IDA takes hundreds of millions of American dollars and poins them Into countries like India. which gets 40 percent of the.IDA mnoneyIndia. a country with 600 million people and massive poverty while the Government of India spends Its own money to build nuclear reactors. nuclear Weapons. space satellites. and giant sports complexes. and in exchange for our generosity. shows Its gratitude by buying massive quantities of Soviet weapons and arrogantly preaching to the United States while refusing to condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. and criticizing us for shooting down two Libyan aircraft after they fired on American pilots. Mr. Chairman. I have heard a lot In the last couple of days about this socalled Edwards amendment to destroy the American foreign aid program. but I am not attacking the American foregin aid program. I am not attacking the hardloan development banks. I am not attacking bilateral assistance. and I am not attacking security assistance. What I am doing Is offering an amendment to give the Congress. as the voice of the American taxpayer. a chance to say to the State Department that It Is time to cut back on our participation in programs which do not recognize the right of this Congress to limit how American dollars are to be spent and which would subsidize this countrys enemies. Let me make another point. Whether you believe the Reagan economic program will work. as I do. or that It will notand I know that there are some In this room who believe that it will notthe fact Is that right now American business is suffering. and It Is suffering because of high Interest rates and Inflation. If an American who owns a business or who wants to buy a home can get a loan at all. the Interest rates are so high that they are prohibitive. Builders and realtors and farmers and small businessmen all over the country are feeling the pinch of those high Interest rates. and I do not believe that any man or woman in this Congress can vote for a $330 million Increase. nearly a third of a billion dollar increase. In appropriations to pay for loans to India with no interest charges. with 50 years to repay. and with 10. years before any kind of repayment is due at all. .You can talk to me about strategy. about conference committees. about coalitions. about the commitments of the previous administration. but there Is no way that you can defend the Increase In IDA funding that is Included In this bill. You juqit cannot do It. You cannot go the American taxpayer. who for the last 6 months has had to pay 17. 18. 19. or 20 percent interest. and make him pay the taxes for an increase in funding to pay for Interestfree loans to build a sports complex In New Delhi. Mr. Chairman. when somebody asked me about the foreign aid bill as a whole and talked about the great need for the security assistance part of thiq programand I agree that we need that part of this programmy response was that the State Department is trying to get us to buy a dog because we like Its tail. I support the security assistance part of this program. but this Is not a security assistance package. That Is a part of It. and the rest of It Is a dog. Mr. Chairman. I have mentioned the high interest rates and the comparison between the high interest rates the American consumer has to pay and the Interestfree loans given by IDA. but let me not forget to also point out to my colleagues that this country has been on a spending binge for 50 years. and because of that spending binge. because of the need to tighten our belts and get this economy back in order. and to stop the inflation that was a result of that spending binge. we have- asked the American people to swallow some mightily bitter pills. We are cutting back on everything except for a few ""sacred cows."" and I do not think folreign aid is a ""sacred cow."" It would be unconscionable and totally Indefensible to reduce student loan benefits. to reduce funding for tile Food and Drug Administration. to reduce. funding for national defensecut. cut. cutand increase IDA spendIng by a third of a billion dollars. That is an absurd and indefensible proposition. and the State Department ought to be embarrassed to come before the U.S. Congress and even propose such an Idea. The American people do not support It. they will not support it. and they will not understand It. What is more. Mr. Chairmanand this is a very important point. and I want the Members to listenthe administration is negotiating right now onl a commitment to the next IDA replenishment. IDA VII. at. even more cost to the American taxpayer. If we do notr send the State Department today a very clear message that we do not want high commitments to IDA funding. we will be spending even more on IDA in the future. 0 1.130 As I said. Mr. Chairman. my amendment is not minor. It is not noncontroversial. but it is simple. It does one thing. This bill increases the level of funding this year for interestfree loans to. countries like India by nearly a third of a billion dollars. It increases .the level of IDA funding by U.S. taxpayers from $520 million to $850 million. and my amendment will take that $330 million increase and put it back In the pockets of the American taxpayers. I ask my colleagues for their support."
970164444,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for taking this time and for giving us an opportunity to express our sadness at the loss of JOHN AsHBROOK. I think we all miss JOHN. We are all going to have a heavy sadness in our hearts for JOHN. but I also feel a very great sadness for America at his loss. Mr. Speaker. Members of Congress come and go. There have been a great many Members in and out of this Chamber just in the short time I have served in the Congress. yet there are some whose loss very much diminishes America. just as their presence very much has enriched America. JoN AsHBROOK is one of those people. I have felt sort of a strange kinship through the years with JOHN AsHBROOK long before I knew him. I am a native of Ohio. before I moved to Oklahoma. Most of my family Is in Ohio. As I was visiting in Ohio. I would always hear about this very unique Member of the Ohio congressional delegation. who always stood up for whithe believed in. that was JOHN AsHBROoK. And then I got active in politics. I went into the Young Republicans and into the national leadership of the Young Republicans. and one of the people who we were shown as one of our role models was JOHN ASHBROOK. who had been already a national chairman of the Young Republicans. I went over to the American Conservative Union as a director. and I am now privileged to be the chairman of that organization. I inherited a very strong organization that . had been founded by JOHN ASHBROOK and of nhich he had served as its national chairman. I came to the Congress. I was appointed to the Education and Labor Committee. where I found that JOHN AsHBROOK must have been one of the most effective. efficient and most popular. most effective ranking members on any committee in the Congress. He provided great leadership to those of us who were new members on the committee looking for guidance. Then as I attempted to involve myself in activities on the floor. we all know that JOHN ASHBROOK had a special place on this House floor and that we had one great man there overseeing what was happening in this Chamber and protecting the Republic from his seat on the House floor. I found that JOHN AsHBROOK did reflect. as so many people have said hex today. a great reservoir of principle and of courage. But I think there is something that is even more important than that. JOHN AsHBRooK was a man of principle and courage. but. more than that. JOHN AsHBROOK. as he stood for things that so many of us find difficult. so many tough decisions where he never wavered. we also found that JOHN ASHBROOK managed to do it being one of the most popular Members of Congress and one of the most effective. I do not think that most people here realize that JOHN AsHBROOK ranked among the most effective Members of Congress in having his amendments adopted by the entire Congress from both sides of the aisle. He had a tremendous track record. if you just keep track of the percentages of his amendments that were adopted and became law. The thing that I remember most about JOHN ASHBROOK is that he would sit in his usual place on the House floor. and for those of us who were younger Members. who were trying to contribute to the debate. and to have some voice in shaping public policy. JOHN ASHBROOK never lacked the time to give us guidance and to teach us. knowing perhaps that the time would come when he would move on from this place and others would be called on to try to fill his shoes. JoHN AsHanoox was a great teacher. America cannot stand to lose very many JOHN ASHBROOKs. But on the other hand. there are not very many
970185809,"Mr. Chairman. the greatest crime any society can commit is to rob a man of his future. In his book. ""Demian."" Herman Hesse wrote: ""Europe had conquered the world. only to lose its soul."" A nation. just like an individual. can lose its soul. It can lose its soul if it betrays those things which are the essence of its being. The essence of America. Mr. Chairman. is opportunity. That is all that America is. That is all that makes America great. That in this land there is opportunity. I will support that Latta budget proposal. Mr. Chairman. and I will vote against the Jones proposal. because there is one essential difference between the two. The Jones budget would increase the taxes on the American people by $55 billion more than the Latta budget over the next 3 years. And. if we adopt the Jones budget we will aestroy opportunity. We will rob Americans of their futures. I recently had the opportunity to be a part of a congressional delegation to Poland. That was a very moving experience for me. because my family is Polish. My fathers parents lived in a tiny village just outside of Warsaw. My aunts and uncles were born and raised outside of Warsaw. My mothers parents lived in tiny Lithuania. And they all came to America. like so many other people. because they had heard that in America we had streets of gold. Mr. Chairman. they did not speak a word of English. but they were not stupid. They knew that we did not have gold paving stones in America. But they knew that here there was opportunity they could not find anyplace else but in America. . One of my grandfathers worked in a scrap yard sorting through. pieces of scrap metal. and my other grandfather pushed a cart through the streets of Cleveland selling old rags and scraps of clothing. And they did it because they knew that here they could find the American dream. And. Mr. Chairman. maybe it is a trite phrase now. but I assure you they knew what the American dream was. It meant that in America they could own their own homes instead of living two or three families in a flat. sharing a bathroom and a kitchen. It meant that in Amercia they could save and send their children to college. I am a college graduate. Mr. Chairman. the first person in the history of my family since the beginning of time to be able to go to college. It meant that in America they could save for their retirement instead of working in the fields or the factories until they fell over dead. That was the American dream. Mr. Chairman. And Government is destroying that dream. This is a nation with a great heart. the hearts of people on both sides of the aisle who care about people and want programs to help them. But we have become a Congress that cannot say no. and so we have started programs to help the poor and watched them grow into programs to subsidize those who are not poorfood stamps for strikers and students. student loans that can go to the children of the rich and often become not loans but gifts. And we watched as interest rates went up to nearly 22 percent. as inflation went beyond 12 percent. and as taxes went higher and higher. and today there is no money to save. and there are no homes being built and there are no people who can buy them and the dream of owning your own home becomes dimmer and dimmer. Mr. Chairman. we as a Congress must stop robbing Americans of their futures. We must stop robbing them of opportunity. The Jones budget is more of the same. Mr. Chairman: It would spend and spend and spend and tax and tax and tax and tax. and the American dream will die. Walt Kelly. in the ""Pogo"" comic strip. once wrote: ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" We are the enemy. Mr. Chairman. We are the people standing in the way of the American dream. and if we pass the Jones budget we may well kill it forever."

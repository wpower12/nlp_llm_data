980000570,Mr. Speaker. today I am joining Representatives JOEL PRITCHARD. WILLIAM HUGHES. and DON BONKER in introducing legislation intended to facilitate the conduct of marine scientific research. This bill is needed to respond to major changes which have occurred over the past decade in the manner in which marine research is regulated by coastal countries. Not long ago. oceanograpliers were free to plan and ca:ry out research projects virtually anywhere on or under the seas of the world. The United States developed the globes largest and bestequipped oceanographic fleet. and U.S. scientists were pioneers in research related to oceanic energy resource. the effect of ocean conditions on weather. marine pollution. and marine biology. In recent years. this situation has changed. Dozens of coastal states have asserted the right to regulate marine research within 200 miles of their shores. The legitimacy of this right. moreover. has been recognized in the text of the Law of the Sea Treaty recently opened for signature in Jamaica. The United States would be hard pressed at this point to deny that a coastal state is entitled to regulate marine research within 200 miles of its shores. subject. of course. to the appropriated delimitation of overlapping zones. Official U.S. policy. nevertheless. continues to recognize such a right generally only within 3 miles of shore. up to 12 miles for fisheries research. and with respect to shelf research throughout the coastal states Outer Continental Shelf. The divergenceg between U.S. policy and that of foreign countries has caused major hardships to U.S. marine scientists in recent years. The Department of State has not been willing to forward requests by U.S. scientists to conduct research in waters adjacent to other states. unless a portion of the research to be conducted is in areas over which the United States explicitly recognizes the right of the foreign state to exercise research control. Many scientists have thus been forced to significantly alter the scopeand costof research projects simply in order to gain State Department cooperation in forwarding research requests. Scientific efforts have also been hampered by the view prevalent In some developing countries that industrialized nations. such as the United States. derive an inequitably large share of the benefits of oceanic research. This attitude stems from a view that much research has important commercial and military implications. and that more developed countries are better able than other states to process and make use of data derived from research. As a result. many countries have begun to place restrictions on foreign scientists seeking to work In their waters. Rights accorded to coastal states by the Law of the Sea Treaty include the right to authorize research. to ask for additional information about particular projects. to participate in and share data derived from research efforts and even to control the publication of information obtained. Under the framework of the treaty. scientists would be required to seek governmental permission to conduct research in waters comprising 42 percent of the worlds oceans. and containing the vast majority of the living and nonliving marine resources in which mankind presently has an~interest. The text of the Law of the Sea Treaty reflects the increasingly uncertain and difficult conditions under which marine scientists are forced to operate. In recent years. U.S. scientists have almost completely abandoned efforts to conduct research in waters close to countries such as India and Trinidad and Tobago. which have made their work exceptionally difficult. In addition. many proposed projects have been curtailed due to actual or anticipated opposition from coastal states. or to uncertainties about the regulations under which the research would be conducted. These difficulties have combined with reductions in Government support for research to create a major crisis for American marine science. These problems cannot be resolved completely through domestic legislative action on the part of the United States. but I believe that Congress can play a role in focusing attention on the crisis. and in pointing a way toward at least a partial solution. The legislation we are proposing today will update U.S. policy to reflect the present stage of evolution of international law. Under the bill. the United States asserts the right to regulate marine scientific research within 200 miles of our shores and on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. It provides. further. that marine research may be conducted by scientists in all areas subject to U.S. research jurisdiction. provided that the research is conducted in a lawful manner. In addition. the Secretary of State will be required to promptly transmit to appropriate foreign officials requests from U.S. scientists for permission to conduct research in areas over which a foreign state legitimately asserts the right to authorize and regulate research. The right of a foreign state to regulate research will be considered legitimate with respect to areas within 200 miles of the shores of that stateagain subject to appropriate delimitationor on its Outer Continental Shelf. These provisions are designed to eliminate the problem which the State Department now has in forwarding research requests to other countries. The United States will both assert for itself. and recognize for other states. the right to regulate marine research on the Outer Continental Shelf and in coastal waters out to 200 miles. By making it clear that the United States does not deem it necessary to enact new restrictions on research in U.S. waters. we will be in a position to argue that other governments should adopt a liberal regulatory regime as well. Clearly. some coastal States may continue to regulate marine research in their waters in a manner which will make it difficult for U.S. scientists either to obtain permission to conduct research. or to carry out projects in an economically feasible or scientifically productive way. This is regrettable. but Congress has no power to legislate for other countries. The bill which we are introducing seeks to make the best of the situation. however. by instructing the Secretary of State to initiate negotiations aimed at obtaining bilateral and multilateral agreements with other nations on the subject of marine research. In conducting these negotiations. the Secretary shall seek agreement on procedures which will minimize fiscal and procedural restraints on marine research. These agreements are to be sought Initially with countries or groups of countries within whose areas of marine research jurisdiction U.S. scientists have expressed the greatest interest in conducting research. The proposal to seek bilateral agreements is consistent with a recommendation made by the ocean policy committee of the National Academy of Science in 1978. and with congressional testimony submitted by leading scientists last year. It is predicated on the view that most coastal States can be persuaded not to interpret their right to regulate marine research in a manner which will make it difficult or impossible for U.S. scientists to conduct responsible research in their waters. Article 243 of the Law of the Sea Treaty provides. moreover. that: States and competent international organizations shall cooperate. through the conclusion of bilateral and multilateral agreements. to create favorable conditions for the conduct of marine scientific research in the marine environment. By adopting an approach which is consistent with international law. and by stating our own willingness to accept research by foreign scientists within U.S. waters. the legislation is designed to create the best possible international climate within which U.S. scientists may submit proposals for research. The bill being introduced today is not intended to reflect either a positive or a negative judgment on the Reagan administrations decision to refrain from signing the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Its purpose is simply to deal as effectively and as practically as possible with the very serious problems presently being experienced by marine scientists of the United States. Before concluding. I want to emphasize my belief in the importance of marine scientific research. This is not a problem. after all. which is of concern solely to oceanographers. academics. and laboratory technicians. It is a matter critical to all those who live near. or who derlve their livelihood in whole or in part from. the resources of the sea. Political boundaries are. from. a scientific perspective. irrelevant. The ability to gather additional data and to compare phenomena in one part of the world with those in another is crucial to understanding both living and nonliving marine resources. Cooperation among scientists and nations is essential to the study of fisheries migration. and to concepts of proper fisheries management. Satellitecollected data on surface water temperatures and on the availability of plankton are important to predictions of fish population. but satellite collection techniques are valueless unless supplemented by onsite sampling conducted from ships. Ocean researchers have provided important information about the movement of the geological plates which make up the Earths crust. Studies in this area are valuable for predicting the presence of oil and mineral resources beneath the ocean floor. Scientists played a key role. as well. in recent discoveries of hydrothermal sulfide deposits thought likely to be of greater importance than the managanese nodules which have for years been the target of proposals for deep seabed mining. Studies of ocean pollution will be severely hampered if political boundaries are permitted to interfere with research. Ocean currents. which disperse pollutants. are significantly lacking in respect for lines drawn on maps. Studies in one part of the world may be indispensable for assessing the potential effects of an action contemplated in another geologically or climatically similar region 10.000 miles away. Marine biologists are faced with the enormously difficult task of studying the chain of life in a vast and everchanging environment to which scientists may only at great cost and difficulty obtain limited access. The effectiveness of their efforts should not be strained further by burdensome restrictions on the geographical scope and efficiency of their research. Theories about marine life on the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States need to be tested against data derived from other parts of the ocean. such as those located in comparable latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Certain types of research. moreover. may best be conducted in relatively pollutionfree waters rarely found off the U.S. coast. It should not be necessary to point out the importance of the oceans to the survival of human life. It is clearly in our interest. therefore. to facilitate efforts aimed at learning everything we possibly can about the oceans and about their effect on our climate. our food supply. and our capacity to generate energy. In turn. we need to learn more about the effect of our industrial. commercial. and recreational activities on the longterm health of the oceans. The legislation we are introducting today will not. in itself. untie the politieal knot presently restricting marine scientific research. It is my belief. however. that the bill. if enacted. would represent a significant step forward. and I think it is about as much as Congress can accomplish through legislative action at the present time. During the weeks ahead. I am hopeful that interested members of the public. and particularly those from the scientific community. will be sharing with Congress their own views on the marine science problem. and on the possible legislative and administrative options which we might take. Representative NORMAN DAMouRs. chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oceanography. has already expressed his intention to hold hearings on the marine science issue. and I am confident that this problem will. under his leadership. receive the attention and action it deserves.e ZIP+4
980068123,I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. this legislation is the product of a cooperative effort between the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. This cooperation was nurtured by similar accommodation and understanding among those most directly affected by the bill. Those representing recreational boaters. sport fishermen. and the manufacturers of boating equipment and fishing tackle have overcome direct competition of interests to join in active support of this legislation. This bill will serve three purposes: First. it will guarantee that revenues derived from the motorboat fuels tax will be used constructively. and for purposes which benefit those required to pay this tax: Second. it will provide additional. muchneeded revenue for the DingellJohnson sport fish restoration fund. and .Third. it will provide $15 million in additional resources to the U.S. Coast Guard. perhaps the single most efficient and versatile agency in the entire Federal Government. This legislation extends the authorization of Federal support for State boating safety programs until the end of fiscal 1988. These programs were initiated 11 years ago in response to a dramatic increase in the number of accidents and fatalities associated with recreational boating. The Federal Boat Safety Act proved to be that rarest of Government initiatives: It accomplished precisely what it was intended to accomplish at substantially less than the anticipated cost. During the past decade and actual number of persons killed annually in boating accidents declined. while the number of boats almost doubled. This means that the rate of fatalities has been cut in half. Although H.R. 2163 seeks to renew support for State boating programs. the funding will be derived directly from the fuels tax paid by recreational boaters. rather than from the general revenues of the U.S. Treasury. This is the approach favored by the boaters. themselves. It is an equitable approach. comparable to the policy of using automobile Prcsoline taxes for highway construction and repair. and it is even more appropriate now that Congress has increased the size of the motorboat fuels tax by a nickel to 9 cent a gallon. It is a premise of this legislation that State governments should begin to play a greater role in certain areas where responsibility now rests almost entirely with the U.S. Coast Guard. I believe. for example. that State governments may be able to establish and maintain aids to navigation in waters used solely by recreational boaters. that they might be able operate search and rescue stations in remote areas. and that they can be of greater assistance to the Coast Guard in responding to violations of maritime law. including drug laws. The Coast Guard Roles and Missions Study. which was prepared last year by the Reagan administration. fully supports this thesis. The funding contained in this bill is essential if greater participation in maritime matters by the States is to become a realistic objective. The Coast Guard has too many important jobs to do. and not enough resources to do any of them as well as the public interest demands. This legislation recognizes the fact that the Coast Guard performs a variety of services for the recreational boating community. Accordingly. $15 million of the amount paid by recreational boaters in the motorboat fuels tax will be dedicated under this bill to the operating expenses account of the Coast Guard. This is fully consistent with the Reagan administrations concept of assessing user fees for certain Coast Guard services. It is. moreover. an application of that concept which is accepted by the public. which will be of direct benefit to the Coast Guard. and which is clearly connected to services for which the taxes involved are assessed. The changes made in this bill by the Committee on Ways and Means will streamline the administration of the act. and fine tune the provisions related to the taxing of sportfishing tackle and equipment. They do not. however. in any way alter the fundamental balance of interests which this legislation is intended to achieve. This bill was designed to make equitable and constructive use of revenues derived from the motorboat fuels tax. and to enlarge the sources of funding for the DingellJohnson program. It achieves both objectives admirably. and I hope very much that it will be approved by this House.
980080850,"Mr. Chairman. this bill seeks to end U.S. Involvement in an operation which is illegal under both American and international law. Which has failed dismally to achieve either its real or its purported goals. Which has undermined U.S. diplomacy worldwide by making nonsense of the very principles of international behavior which we ask others to observe. Which has. inevitably. I trust. in a free society. become less a covert operation than an ongoing embarrassment played out daily on the front pages of our newspapers. Which has damaged regional peace initiatives. and retarded the development of a consensus in Congress about U.S. policy toward Central America. Which has resurrected questions and criticisms about the role of the CIA in protecting U.S. interests overseas. and Which has distorted and aggrandized the role of the military in Honduras. has involved it in acts of U.S.sponsored adventurism. and thereby retarded the development of strong civilian political institutionsfrom the Presidency on downin that country. The Reagan administration has not been honest with either the Congress or the public in describing and defending this operation. The individuals we have trained and financed to fight against Nicaragua are not under our control. they have their own agenda. they have no history of support for Democratic principles. and they are actively seeking to trigger a civil war in which thousands of innocent people seem sure to die. H.R. 2760 embodies a mature congressional response to a brutal. ineffective project of the executive branch. It calls the bluff of the President. who told the world the operation was designed solely to interdict arms. and the bluff of Nicaragua.. which claims there are no arms to interdict. Nicaragua is much to blame for its poor relations with its neighbors. for the injection of EastWest isues into the region: and for its failure to generate confidence within Nicaragua in the integrity of its political institutions. Those shortcomings have produced a temptation. even among some men of good will. to wage war to make Nicaragua ""safe for democracy."" It is already too late to expect the Nicaraguan junta to fulfill voluntarily all the promises of the revolution. But it is far too early to assume that U.Ssupported armed intervention is the only means by which Nicaragua or Nicaraguans may avoid the Cuban path. A political dissident. even in todays Nicaragua. may be ignored he may be harassed. he may fear for his life. he may. accordingly. choose exile. But compare this to El Salvador where even according to President Reagans own certification. political dissidents are simply killed. When the United. States resorts to. or encourages the use of. armed force. it must do so in a manner and for purposes which are consistent with our values and our best traditions. and for reasons understood and supported by the American public and. in this instance.. by our friends in Latin AmerIca. It is by reinforcing our. traditions and ideals. rather than by abandoning them. that we may compete most suc aessfully with those we consider adversaries. To underline this point. I would like to read briefly from an essay written 2 years ago. after the Bay of Pigs. by Walter Lippmann:"
980092359,Mr. Chairman. I rise in vcry strong support of this bill and. in lieu of a prepared statement. I would like to respond to a couple of questions that have been raised in the course of this debate and to some statements which I think demonstrate some uncertainty as to the true nature of thle legislation before us. This is not essentially a new program. It is not an attempt to reach out and find new Federal dollars to achieve new purposes hitherto unaddressed by Federal programs. This is an attempt essentially. having some of thle verbage stripped from it. to salvage three existing. modest. and very successful Federal programs. Thle admninist ration has sought to abolish the coastal zone management program. the sea grant program. and the coastal energy impact program. which is. in fact. part of the CZM program itself. These programs have been enormously successful in their operation over a number of years. Absent the legislation before us now. if the trend in declining appropriations were to continue at the administrations request and insistence. we would find ourselves in 1 or 2 or 3 years at the most essentially without any of these programs. And they meet. I suggest. a very. very important need on the part of the coastal States of the Nation. The coastal zone management prograins authorization expires In 1985. The sea grant programs authorization expires this year. in 1983. And thle coastal energy impact program expires in 1988. Take. for example. the sea grant program. a very small. a very modest program. No Member of this Institution needs to be reminded about the importance and the historical significance of our land grant colleges and the extraordinary role they have played in the assistance of our landbased agriculture in the history of the United States. going back more than a century. The sea grant program is a recent and extremely modest attempt to lend that kind of expertise and support to the development of our marinebased resources. particularly the fisheries of the Nation. It has been funded at a very small level and it has been very successful. The coastal zone management program. if there is a program on the books of this land that ought to appeal to this administration it is the CZM program. It is federalism incarnate. It recognizes the shared responsibilities of both the Federal and State governments with respect to decisionmaking having to do with the production of energy in the waters of this Nation. It is not a Federal decision that has to be made. it is not a Stale decision that has to be made. it is a genuinely shared responsibility. And this is a very finely tuned. very carefully balanced approach to what is In fact and what ought to remain a shared responsibility. To those Members who somehow. have conjured fears of a vast new Federal program being created by this legislation or vast new Federal dollars being sought by its authors. you can put those fears to rest. The simplest. way. I think. to express that is that the three programs which we essentially seek to save In this bill are authorized under current law. in the current fiscal year. for a total of $364 .million. If this bill instead were lavi. those three programs would have an authorization of only $300 million. So in terms of the authorizal ion Itself. this actually constitutes a reduction in the authorized Federal commitmnent for the programs about whichwe are concerned. The bottom line of course arnd the need for this legislation stems not from those authorizing numbers. but from what has happened to the actual appropriated dollars In the past few years. In 1978. these programs were appropriated to the tune of $197.7 million. In the current fiscal year that has gone down to $43.4 million and It will go directly to zero. very promptly. In a year or two or three. absent this legislation. That is why It is Important. that is why it is crucial and that is why It seems to me It ought to appeal to all Members of this House. I urge Its adoption. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5. the Ocean and Coastal Resources Management and Development Block Grant Act. This bill has widespread supt5ort. among Members of Congress from coastal districts because it has as Its central purpose tile preservation of two Federal Government programs which have clearly proven their value to all those who live near. or who derive their livelihood from the resoarces of. the sea. During the 96th Congress. I served as chairman ot the Subcommittee on Oceanography. We undertook an extensive series of oversight hearings prior to considering legislation to reauthorize thle coastal zone management programs originally created in 1972. 1 embarked on that process genuinely skeptical about the value of coastal zone management. I had thle suspicion that perhaps this was a programlike many othersthat wats treasured only by the State and Federal bureaucrats employed by it. and that the public at large would be indifferent at best to its continuation. But I was wrong. Our subcommittee developed thousands of pages of testimony from town officials. from fishermen. from thos6 dependent on thle tourist industry. from beachifront property owners. from environmentalists and from many others who were convinced that coastal zone management had servedand could continue to serveprecisely the purpose for which it. was created. thrt is. to provide for the balanced. prudent use of thle coastal areas of our Nation. Thle sea grant program. whose future is equally entwined with the fate of the bill we are considering today. has for a decade been generatingat very little costthe kind of scientific expertise which our .Nation must have to understand and to utilize with confidence thle resources of the marine environment. The Reagan administration has opposed funding for these programs from the first day it took office. During that period. Interior Secretary James Watt has attempted to turn his Department from the legally appointed guardian of our Nations natural resources Into their most aggressive salesman. In doing so. he has sought not only to sell the publics resources as rapidly and as cheaply as possible. butin alliance with 0MBhe has attempted to deprive State and local governments and the scientific community of the means to fight back. These policies have not worked. By seeking to eliminate or to ignore the procedural requirements of our offshore leasing statutes. the administration has forced State governments to rely more the more on the courts to Septeniber 14. 1.983 guarantee the protection of their rights. The coastal zone management program is designed to permit State governments to work In partnershipboth with the Federal government and with their own town and local governmentsnot to block coastal development. or to prevent oil leasing on the OCS. but to pursue a coordinated and balanced program. combining development with conservation and appropriate safeguards In a manner as satisfactory as possible to all. The bill we are considering today. H.R. 5. seeks to achieve the same goal. If it is accurate to generalize about this bill. at all. I would characterize it as legislation designed to protect the right of State governments to have a say In what the Federal Government does in coastal areas within or adjacent to their territory. It is as simpleand It should be as noncontroversialas that. This bill Is fully consistent with the Federalist traditions which this administration claims to support. it would guarantee the continuation of programs which have been carefully scrutinized by the Congress. and which have proven their value to the public. It has the support of a bipartisan and geographically diverse coalition of Members who are dedicated to serving coastal areas throughout. our country. and I urge the House to follow the lead of the gentleman from North Carolina . and the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. DAmou~s). and approve this bill by an overwhelming margin.
980147192,Mr. Chairman. I rise In support of the amendment. I. like many others. have been concerned by recent reports that the Reagan administration may contract out for nautical chartmaking services and other functions essential to the safety of marine navigation. I believe it is always useful to reexamine the extent to which services now provided by the Government might better be provided by the private sector. I suggest. however. that we concentrate this examination In areas where problems are known to exist. or where the Government Ia able to provide a service only at exorbitant cost. The nautical chartmaking mission of NOAA is fulfilled. at present. by about 150 Individuals working with a budget of roughly $4.000.000. The quality of their work is respected worldwide. It has been relied upon without disappointment by our fishermen. commercial pilots. recreational boaters and cargo vessel operators for many years.. There Is little. If anything. to be gained In dollars. and much to be risked In safety. by considering a contracting process for this type of service. Expertise In areas of vital importance to the economy. safety and security of our country--and tat Is precisely what the NOAA chartmaking service now providesought to reside within. not outside. the Government. Its value to our country cannot be duplicated through a contracting proc. ess. If the administration does propose to contract out for certain services now provided by NOAA. I think Congress should consider those proposals objectively. But Congress has an obligation not to permit major changed In areas where change is not needed. where change will save little or no money. and where change may endanger the lives of those who require dependable information for navigation at sea. The amendment we are now considering Is intended only to make certain that Congress will have an opportunity to review any administration proposals which are indeed forthcoming. It ought not to be a controversial amendment. but I believe. nevertheless. that It is an Important one and I urge Its adoption.
980173008,I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the MARAD authorization bill. I am especially pleased that the legislation includes $5 million to be used in conversion of the cargo ship. Santa Mercedes. to a training vessel for the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Since December 1981. when a tragic fire destroyed the training ship. the Bay State. and took the life of one cadet. the Massachusetts Maritime Academy has been without its own vessel. In recent years. the school has been forced to borrow a ship from either the Maine or New York academies. an arrangement that has created large administrative problems and worked to the detriment of all students involved. In fiscal year 1983. Congress authorized and appropriated some $10 million for MARAD to either repair or replace the Bay State. I am pleased that the Santa Mercedes has now been purchased for this purpose. However. I am concerned that MARAD does not have adequate funds available to carry out the needed conversion. Approximately $5.8 million remains from the $10 million already made available by the Congress. but this is clearly insufficient to do the job right. MARAD and I say this in respone to the observations of the gentleman from Kentucky. will need at least the $5 million made available by this bill to provide the academy with the facility that Its students deserve and require. The gentleman is correct that no one can say with certainty at this point what the final bill will be. but I think if anything is certain in this world it is that this will not cover it. I also want to take this opportunity to. on behalf of the faculty and students of the Massachusetts Maritime Acaeemy. thank the gentleman from New York . the chairman of the subcommittee. for his efforts. As he well knows. what we do with respect to the determination of the adequacy of conversion of this vessel will set a precedent for conversions of vessols still to come. presumably for the remaining academies. one of which. as the gentleman well knows. is in the State of New York. I thank the gentleman very much for his leadership and I urge strong support of the bill.
980182422,Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing. along with Representatives BIAGGI. MARKEY. MAVROULES. FRANK. MOAKLEY. BOLAND. and DONNELLY. a bill Intended to restore the Atlantic striped bass to its historic status as one of the most valuable and plentiful commercial and sport fish species on the east coast. This spectacular fish has become imperiled by environmental problems exacerbated by continued pressure from fishermen. Over the past 20 years. striped bass catch has declined by 90 percent recent annual landings are the lowest on record. Delaware Bay has ceaAed to serve as a significant spawning ground for the species. and reproduction rates in Chesapeake Bay have fallen far below that needed to sustain current levels of population. The need for action is clear and urgent. However. because the fish has the good sense generally to avoid Federal waters. it has been less clear who it is that must act. S9tate action would be preferable. but it must be cufficient to guarantee that the striped bass will recover and. thus far. this has not been the case. The approach taken by the legislation we are introducing today is simple. effective. and fair. Member States of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFS) will be encouraged to implement the recommendations of the Commission with respect to regulating the taking of striped bass. Those recommendations call for a 55 percent further reduction in striped bass catch from levels proposed by the Commission in 1981. The new proposed level reflects the best scientific judgment about the reduction needed to permit full restoration of the species. The target date for State compliance will be December 1. During that month. and every 6 months thereafter. the ASMFC will be required to notify the Secretary of Commerce if any State has failed to establish and enforce the guidelines needed to reduce striper catch by the required amount. Upon receiving this notification. the Secretary shall impose. and the Federal Government shall enforce. a moratorium on the taking or landing of striped bass in that State or States. The moratorium will remain in effect for each State to which it has been applied until the State comes into compliance with the recommended guidelines for reducing striper catch. The approach taken by this legislation is intended to preserve the primary role of State governments in the management of fish species within its waters. The Federal role will be to enforce decisions reached by an organization whose judgment reflects the collective wisdom of the States. the ASMFC. But the purpose and the effect of the bill is clear. Action will be taken to protect the striped bass. The legislation we are introducing today is a logical successor to earlier actions taken by the Federal Govern. nent in response to the growing need to protect the striped bass. Five years ago. Congress mandated a study to identify the source of the problem and to recommend a solution. Two years ago. Congress ordered that fisheries research funds be denied to State gov. ernments unwilling to cooperate in restricting striper fishing in their waters. This bill responds to the evidence produced by the scientific study. and it takes one step further the notion that the Federal Government has an obligation to encourage prompt and effective action by the States. Enactment of this legislation is necessary to protect the striped bass. but it should be accompanied by further environmental restoration efforts i striper spawning areas. and by additional scientific research. These three steps will insure our success. and I hope that all those with an interest in the future of the striped bass will come together in support of this effort.*
980190369,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I think as we come to what I think in the judgment of many Members is perhaps the most important and certainly the most controversial section of the bill. that it is important that Members understand the situation we are faced with at the moment in terms of parliamentary procedure. There are two amendments in order under the rule to the section dealing with Central America. the one which is before us now. offered by myself. There are 3 hours of debate available on that amendment. 1% hours controlled by myself and 1% hours controlled by the ranking minority member. the gentleman from Michigan . After the disposition of this amendment. there is a second amendment in order under the rule which will be offered by the gentleman from Michigan. and there will be 3 hours of debate on that amendment. onehalf under the control of the gentleman from Michigan. the author of the amendment. and onehalf under the control of the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. the gentleman from Florida . What that adds up to. my colleagues. is. on the assumption that all the time is taken. a debate of as long possibly as 6 hours on the question of U.S. policy in Central America. I understand. and I think most Members understand. and we certainly had a preview of this last evening. that not only is this in many Members minds the most important and the most controversial section of the bill. but it will clearly be that section and that portion of the debate which will generate the most emotion. As I said. in anticipation of the possibility and indeed the likelihood of considerable emotion on this floor in the ensuing 4 or 5 or 6 hours of debate. I wonder if at the beginning it might be possible. before we get to the arguments of the wisdom or lack of wisdom of U.S. policy. to stipulate perhaps in somewhat simplified fashion the facts of the substance of the amendments that will be before us. I am going to attempt to do that. I grant it may be a bit oversimplified. but I think most Members will concur. before we get into the debate itself on questions of policy. in the essentially three alternatives that are before this committee. The amendment before us at the moment. the amendment offered by myself. would condition all U.S. military aid to El Salvador on the ability and willingness of that Government to meet a series of conditions and on the willingness of the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States to concur that those conditions had been met. In that case. under the amendment before us. all the military aid requested by the President for El Salvador for fiscal year 1985 would be forthcoming. That is one approach. The second approach. the middle ground. if you will. is embodied in the committee bill which will be defended by the chairman of the committee. the gentleman from Florida . Essentially that approach would say that if the President wishes. onethird of the money for military assistance to El Salvador would be forthcoming. but the remaining twothirds would be conditioned both on the agreement by the President that certain conditions had been met and on affirmative action by the Congress. Finally. Mr. Chairman. although this is perhaps a bit oversimplified. as I say. I think fairly one could summarize the approach which will be offered by the gentleman from Michigan
980252778,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the conference report on S. 2463. the offshore oil revenue sharing bill. I support this legislation because it is equitable. because it will insure the survival of Federal support for State coastal zone management programs. and because it will help State governments respond in a variety of constructive ways to everincreasing economic and environmental demands on their coastal resources. This bill is fair. because it will do for coastal States what has long been done for interior States. the very States just recited in that list by the gentleman from Texas. which is to provide a portion of the revenues derived from Federal mineral leasing in or adjacent to their boundaries to the State governments affected by that leasing. The survival of coastal zone management programs is important because those programs were established to perform a difficult but vital task. and they have done so with growing sucI194180 cess in recent years. As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oceanography during the 96th Congress. I conducted a series of hearings throughout this country on the Coastal Management Program. I began as a skeptic. but the message our subcommittee received from fishermen. coastal property owners. local government officials. businessmen. and State officials was unanimous: This program works. it is vital to sound and balanced planning in the coastal zone. keep it alive. The demands we as a nation place on the coastal areas of this country are increasing every day. Transportation. recreation. the commercial recovery of resources both living and nonliving. the disposal of a variety of wastes. the continuing need to accommodate a greater and greater proportion of our population seeking to live near the ocean. these demands are creating everincreasing economic and environmental pressure on the coasts. This is not solely a State problemit is a national problem. The legislation we are considering today recognizes the scope of that problem. and responds to it in a manner that recognizes. as well. the partnership that should exist between the State and Federal Governments in dealing with coastal Issues. This bill is the very essence of federalism. a concept that for at least a couple of days back in 1982 was warmly embraced. through public speeches and press releases by this President. and the officials of his administration. In closing. I want to congratulate our distinguished chairman. the gentleman from North Carolina . and the equally distinguished chairman of the Oceanography Subcommittee Mr. DAmouns. for their leadership in bringing this bill to this point. I congratulate as well the ranking minority member of the full committee. Mr. PRITCHARD. and of the subcommittee. Mr. CARNEY. for their vital support. I think a special word of praise should also go to Tom Kitsos. of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee staff. who believed in this bill long before anyone with a firm grip on logic or reality could be persuaded to do so. Let me say in response to the gentleman from Texas. as the gentleman from North Carolina has stated. this is not by any stretch of the imagination an entitlement program. Not only is it subject to appropriations annually. but it tries to keep alive a variety of programs that have been authorized for a great many years. and which this administration has been attempting to eliminate. such as the Coastal Zone Management Act. the Coastal Energy Impact Program. and many fisheries programs. among others. These are not new programs. They have been on the books for a great many years and they work and they ought to be supported. above all else. by those who believe in a proper balance of responsibility between the State and Federal Governments. I hope this conference report will be adopted today by an overwhelming margin and that our friends in the other body will cooperate by putting this legislation where it belongs: on the desk in the Oval Office. where I trust our Nations leading proponent of the New Federalism will sign it enthusiastically into law.

980013897,"Mr. Speaker. it is a sad note for this world that we must meet as a body to highlight various nations abuses of individuals and groups human rights. Today. once again we meet to commemorate the anniversary of the imprisonment 6 years ago of 35yearold Anatoly Shcharansky. As we are all aware. Mr. Shcharansky has been at the center of the Soviet Jewry movement since he was refused permission to emigrate to Israel in 1973. As a leading ""refusenik."" his outspokenness brought increased scrutiny from the Soviet regime. Imprisoned in 1977 on phony charges. he was sentenced to 13 years in jail. On top of this. his recent bride. Avital. was forced to leave the Soviet Union for Israel the day after the two were.married in 1977. The only crime that Anatoly Shcharansky committed was the ""crime"" that e was Jewish. that he wished to praice the religion of his fathers and es ape from the harsh persecution of the Jews in the Soviet Union. It is unfortunate that I am only too familiar with the treatment being accorded Anatoly Shcharansky by the United States. The family of one of my constituents. Boris Shenfeld of Jersey City. has been trying to leave the Soviet Union since 1979. On three different occasions Mr. Shenfelds sister Geta Liberant and her husband Arkady have applied for permission to emigrate with their children. On each occasion they have been refused. As a refusenik. Geta Liberant has lost her job and the family is forced to live in an apartment that does not have the basic minimum amenities. While the plight of Arkady and Geta Liberant is less life threatening than the treatment being accorded Anatoly Shcharansky. the two cases taken together are representative of the Soviet treatment of Russian Jewry. There are thousands upon thousands of people in the position of the Liberant family. At any time. the Soviets can decide that they are a threat and accord them treatment similar to that endured these past 6 years by Mr. Shcharansky. There is no reason for the Liberants to be denied permission to emigrate and there is no reason why Mr. Shcharansky should be in jail. The Soviet Union must be held accountable for its treatment of both religious and political dissidents. The Soviet Union must follow the Helsinki accords of 1975 and allow its citizens the right to religious freedom and emigration.e"
980025362,Mr. Speaker. I join our colleagues in expressing my sorrow over the passing of a remarkable Congressman and a great man. the Honorable PHILLIP BURTON. I shall miss him and his high sense of conscience and duty to Americas less fortunate. we have lost a champion who will be difficult to replace. We all work knowing that Congress is a manyfaceted institution. with Members interests covering a gamut of issues. It is often difficult to build coalitions to get the right thing done. no matter how noble the cause. And yet. PmL iURToN had the talent to bring people together when action was necessary to right wrongs. provide relief to the deititute. or protect the precious natural beauty of our great Nation. No one came to a meeting better prepared than PHIL BURTON. His eye for detail and his remarkable memory complemented an appetite for hard work that was truly phenomenal. With a characteristic brashness. PHIL was justified in saying he knew more about public assistance policy or our national park system than anyone else. He knew the facts and had an intimate familiarity with these diverse issues. to an extent which would normally take the talents of 10 technicians. PHIL BURTON was widely known as an aggressive legislator who did not shy from explicitly expressing his views. But there was much more to this man. My executive director. Nancy Drake. had the privilege of working for PHIL BURTON for many years. She attests to another side. ever present but often hidden. to this giant of a man. He was a man who doted on children. especially his two grandchildren. Julian and Laura Temes. the children of his daughter Joy. He experienced no greater pleasure nor delight than their presenceand if you should doubt this. then you should have seen him glow as they wrapped their arms around his neck. PHIL BURTON had a way. a certain rapport with children. They immedi ately took to him. To me this is a tall measure of a man. particularly this man. PniLLi BURTON. The memorial services for PHIL are to be held at the Golden Gate Nation. al Recreation Area. which is so appropriate because he spent so much of his time and energy on the legislation which established this beautiful and peaceful area. I want to express my heartfelt condolences to PmLS wife. Sala Burton. who is as remarkable a woman as I have ever met. Sala was in every sense a partner of PHILS. work ing side by side with him as a leader for peace. In the movement for equal rights for women and minorities. and for social and economic justice for all of our people. Those of us who know Sala Burton know that she will do all In her power to carry on PHILs work. I applaud her. I extend my deepest sympathies to her. and my prayers are with her in the difficult days that are ahead. We shall all miss PHIL BURTON greatly.e
980047817,Mr. Speaker. today I am Introducing legislation vhich will provide Federal financial assistance to States which establish programs to aid women and their children who have been exposed to the drug diethylstilbestrol. commonly called DES. My bill will assist States which establish identification and registration programs. provide screening for cancer related to DES. and disseminate public information regarding the health hazards associated with this drug. Created In 1938. DES is a synthetic hormone which was frequently prescribed to women who had histories of complications during pregnancy. It was most heavily prescribed from 1945 through 1960. Although studies as early as 1953 questioned its effectiveness. its use continued into the 1970s. During that time. an estimated 4 to 6 million women and their children were exposed to DES. In 1971. a clear link was established between exposure to DES before birth and an increased risk of a rare form of cancer In young women. By 1980. over 400 cases of clearcell adenocarcinoma had been reported. Early detection and treatment are vital to efforts to contain this cancer and to preserve the reproductive capacities of its victims. Further studies indicate that up to 90 percent of DES daughters experience adenosis. abnormal growths or structural changes in their reproductive tracts. While these abnormal cell growths may be the basis for the development of clearcell adenocarcinoma. increasing evidence indicates that the abnormalities may disappear over time. Proper screening and regular examinations are an important part of the followup care DES daughters require. Recent studies suggest that DES daughters experience more difficulties than average women when they become pregnant themselves. Such women have a higher rate of premature deliveries. miscarriages and associated complications. It is suspected that these difficulties are related to reproductive damage resulting from exposure to DES. It is essential that DES daughters and their doctors be familiar with the potental hazards they face if DES daughters become pregnant. The sons of women who took DES during pregnancy have been shown to have an increased rate of reproductive and urinary tract abnormalities. To date. studies have not established a link between exposure to DES and increased rates of genital cancer or infertility In young men. Nevertheless. continued observation is warranted. According to some research. the mothers who took DES during pregnancy are at a righer risk for contracting breast cancer or other forms of cancer of the reproductive organs. This research is being reviewed. but it is important for DES mothers to receive thorough screenings and examinations. Clearly. women and their children who have been exposed to DES face increased health risks. The oldest DES daughters and sons are not yet 40. so the longterm effects of DES are still unknown. It will be necessary for DES mothers and their children to be examined at regular intervals for the rest of their lives. Yet many women and their children are unaware that they are at risk and that they require special screening for cancer. For many women. public awareness of the concern surrounding the drug DES has not reached them. Many women are unfamiliar with the drugs their doctors prescribed or have not obtained access to their medical records. Still others have been too frightened to tell their daughters and sons of the risks they face. Several States have begun programs to identify these women and advise them of the health risks they face and the steps they can take to insure that they receive the best care. My bill will offer assistance with these efforts by providing matching funds at a ratio of 75 percent Federal funds to 25 percent State funds channeled through the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. It is too late to prevent the damage caused by exposure to DES. but we can and should make a commitment to providing health information and screening assistance to those at increased risk.e
980049665,"Mr. Speaker. today. the House of Representatives will consider H.R. 2207. the Emergency School Aid Act. which will provide assistance to local school districts to meet the educational needs of school desegregation and to encourage voluntary desegregation. I want to express my strong support for this bill and to urge its passage. The original Emergency School Aid Act became law in 1972 and was instrumental in helping many school districts across the Nation implement voluntary desegregation plans. Bayonne and Union City. N.J.. made substantial strides forward in their desegregation efforts directly due to ESAA funding assistance. These two cities also typify the problems which occurred after ESAA was folded into chapter II block grant funding for education 2 years ago. In 1981. the school districts formerly receiving ESAA grants had been notified by the Department of Education that they would receive multlyear grants of 3 to 5 years. In good faith. these school districts planned and began implementing such multiyear programs. Despite these commitments. ESAA funds were abruptly cut off and the funds melded into chapter II block grant moneys. School districts were left holding the bag on their desegregation programs. Suddenly. upward of onehalf of all operation funds were cut off. and cities with desegregation problems were left to compete with betteroff communities for diminishing funds. Any progress made since ESAA began in 1972 was interrupted. Programs to set up -magnet schools and to improve community and parent relations were slashed. Significantly. no ESAA funds were ever used for busing students. When ESAA and 28 other categorical education programs were folded into one block grant. total funding became well below the sums each of the 29 programs had received individually. The new block grant funds were distributed on the basis of total student population. and aid was not targeted to those districts facing significant problems in desegregating their schools. The point of the block grant philosophy is that education initiatives should be the prerogative of local and State school districts. I agree that often local and State districts are the best judge of local needs. However. when the block grant system is used as a tool to purposely slash good and necessary education programs. the block grant system of funding ""for local initiatives"" loses its philosophical appeal. Desegregation. and civil rights of any sort. remain a national priority. Focused national attention should be directed to eradicating the problem of school segregation. whether such segregation is deliberate or is a result of population trends. When these desegregation efforts are lost in a myriad of other programs. we must act to distinguish such efforts and to fund them separately. If necessary. We have seen the drastic effects the block grant form of funding has had on local desegregation efforts. Clearly. it has become necessary to reestablish the Emergency School Aid Act as an entity with separate Federal funding If we wish to continue our school desegregation efforts on an effective level. I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2207 and thereby support national school desegragation ini- tiatives.e"
980062725,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of R.R. 1138. a bill to cap the third year of the tax cut at $700. Back In April of last year. 1982. this bill was dropped in a hopper as It was then already obvious to many of us that we would be heading for disastrous deficits It is extremely important that we make a strong effort at this point to reduce the enormous deficits that are now confronting Congress. In an era of $200 billion shortfalls. this bill is a test of our national resolve for getting the deficits down and keeping them down. And while it is true that this bill will only go part way toward reducing our deficits. $6 billion in fiscal year. 1984 and $38 billion over the next 5 years. we must make a real beginning. We are all aware thpt there is a widespread concern that the Reagan deficits will choke off a sustained economic recovery by keeping interest rates high. Responsible solutions. and H.R. 1183 is one of them. must be considered. Is there any fairer or more appropriate or more painless way to raise necessary and needed revenues? The budget we just passed calls for $12 billion in new revenues and this is a most promising and likely place for us to raise those moneys. The concern about high U.S. deficits is shared not just by many of us in Congress. but also by leading world financial institutions. Only recently the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. Switzerland. which is deeply troubled over the disastrous state of the world economy. called upon the United States to set its financial house in order. The BIS termed the high U.S. interest rates seriously damaging to the world economy and stated that the principal responsibility for lowering these rates... clearly falls upon the U.S. authority and squarely upon the shoulders of those in charge of our fiscal policy here in the United State:! The report concludes that concerted action on the part of the United States to reduce interest rates. and reducing deficits is an important part of the effort. would have a salutory effect in Japan. West Germany. and Great Britain. This. in turn. would provide much needed relief to the debtridden economies of the rest of the world. It is important to note that the focus of this report is not on a solution 2 years down the road. as advocated by the administration in accepting budget deficits of $200 billion in each of the next 2 years. a call was issued for America to act now before the fragile U.S. economic recovery falters and before there is a secondjyave of crises amongst Third World nations that are already in deep trouble. Having made these observations. I would like to commend my colleagues who are concerned over struggles of working families and needy people during these times of unemployment. But I particularly would like to address my remarks to the 10 percent of the taxpayers that are concerned with this particular bill. for they will be affected in some measure. A great responsibility for leadership in this Nation rests upon those of you who share significantly in our Nations blessings and our future. It is your leadership. your sense of social responsibility and social conscience which are needed today. There is a great show of concern. and it has been shown from the other side. about a tax cut being taken away. In fact. everybody in this select group will receive at least a $700 tax break in this coming year. Already. you. the selected few. have benefited greatly from changes in ERTA. the Economic Recovery Tax Act. We have reduced the capital gains of 28 to 20 percent. which you are able to benefit from. We have reduced the top marginal rate. the marginal rate. from 70 percent to 50 percent. Not to mention i1beralization that we have given in forms of tax credits and accelerated depreciation. These changes have been to the benefit of those few who are in this 10 percent category. Today. our foremost national priority should be reduction of the unparalleled Federal deficits caused by this administrations policies. Without a national strategy. a national resolve. a national purpose that we will do everything possible as a top priority to stop the massive hemorrhaging from happening in our economy today. we will not succeed in lowering our deficits. We now have a $1.3 trillion debt ceiling.
980100591,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3813. the International Coffee Agreement Act of 1983 legislation which I have introduced with my colleague. Mr. Fluznt. I want to thank both Chairman Gianosrs and Chairman RosTEmixowsicr for their expeditious handling of this legislation. With the present agreemerit expiring on September 30. the prompt consideration given to this regislatlon was greatly appreciated. With this said. I urge my colleagues to. suspend the- rules and pass H.R. 3813. the International Coffee Agreement Act of 1983. The United States has participated In International Coffee Agreements since 1962 In. an effort to stabilize the wide variations in price and to balance the economic Interests of producers and consumersm The basic framework of the 1983 agreement is similar to the agreement that has been In effect since 1976. The International Coffee Agreement of 1983 was negotiated by 71 countries.. The. International Coffee Agreement. the ICA. Is an International treaty. and as such was ratified by the United States Senate on July. 27. 1983. by a vote of 100 to 0. One of the main reasons this treaty was unanimously approved by the Senate was Its acceptance by consumer organizations. These groups have no problem with an agreement that assures stability of prices and longterm supply. An American consumer adviser was present during the negotiations of the treaty. and he fully approved the final agreement. Coffee is the most important agricultural commodity in the export trade of the developirig world. Over 40. nations depend on coffee for export earnings. and 10 of these nations. earned more than. 25 percent of their foreign exchange from coffee exports. The United States is the worlds largest consumer of coffee. and U.S. participation in the ICA Is Important for the economies of the developing.nations. Full U.S. involvement serves a foreign policy goal of improving relations- with these developing countries. The 71 countries participating in the ICA of 1983 are responsible for virtually all production of coffee and over 90 percent of world coffee consumption. The ICA itself contains no. fixed price objective. Rather. each year the mem-
980110568,"Mr. Speaker. because of a personal relationship with members of the Walesa family. I would like to add my congratulations to Lech Walesa. the Polish Solidarity labor leader who was awarded the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize yesterday. I wish to commend the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee for their courage in making this award to this dynamnic young man. Lech Walesa has electrified tile entire world by seeking to establish the rights of workers in Poland. a most important human right as defined by the United Nations. It was my pleasure in 1981 and for each subsequent year to recommend Mr. Walesa for this award. The Walesa family has deep roots In Jersey City and Hudson County. which I represent In the 14th District. Walesas mother came to Jersey City In 1971 to live with her sister. She lived in my district with Stanislaw Walesa. her second husband. He wds the brother of Bolek Walesa. Lechs father. who died after World War II. Lechs mother died In 1974 after she was struck by an automobile and killed while crossing a street In Bayonne. Stanislaw Walesa remained In Jersey City and worked with Mr. Herman Boeckner. owner of the Henderson Lumber Mill. until his death in 1981. I attended the funeral of Stanislaw Walesa. who died last year. just 2 months before he would have been 65 years of age. A closeness developed between Mr. Walesa and Walter Brolewicz. Lechs first cousin. who was born and raised In Jersey City and now resides in Passaic. The three of us met periodlcally to discuss Lechs plight. Deeply impressed with Lechs leadership of the struggle in Poland for the cause of peace and Justice and freedom of all people. I recommended him for the Nobel Peace Prize. My remarks apof February 18. 1981. as follows: Mr. Speaker. I rise today to discuss a subject which not only gives us great pergonal pleasure. but Is also a subject of great pride In my District. Mr. Speaker. Lech Walesa. the courageous leader of the Polish Free Trade Union known as Solidarity. has recently been nominated for the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize. I would like to take this occasion to state here on the floor of the House that I can think of no more appropriate recipient for this prestigious award than Mr. Walesa. He has set an example for all persons. regardless of nationality or the political system their nation follows. as one who cherishes freedom and the dignity of working men and women. Lech Waleas has arrived at his present position of International prominence not as a man seeking personal power. or even a formal office in his countrys government. He has come to our attention because of spectacular events in Poland. for which he has been the prime catalyst. having galvanized the imagination and respect of peoples throughout the world. It is not my intention here today to speak to the merits or shortcomings of the communist system under which Mr. Walesas Poland finds itseif operatingthat Is a subject for another time and another day. In leading his people. Lech Walesa has remained a calm and steady figure In the face of the overwhelming threat of a Soviet invasion of his beloved Poland. And Mr. Speaker. as we all know from the sad and tragic history of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. such threats aire far from Idle exercise. Mr. Walesa has balanced these concerns with the very real needs of working people in Poland. He has resisted provocative counsel to push immediately to a confrontation even as at the same time he has resisted the easy path of retreat and surrender. Mr. Speaker. I said that we In New Jerseys 14th Congressional District have great pride in Lech Walesas. achievements. That is for two reasons. Stanislaw Walesia. father of this now world renowned labor leader. lives and works in our District and is Imployed at the Henderson Lumber Mills In Jersey City. Like so many before him. the senior Mr. Walesa came to our shores in search of freedom and the land of opportunity. And. as you know. New Jerseys 14th Congressional District lies In the very shadow of the Statue of Liberty. long a symbol to generations of immigrants seeking a new life in America and leaving behind the oppression and totalitarian governments of their native lands. The people of our District. tens and thousands of them. feel a special bond with the Walesas. father and son: We all fervently pray that awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Lech Walesa will be the crowning event in a peaceful and successful achievement of his worthy goals. Perhaps such International recognition will give pause for reflection to those who would crush freedom In Poland through force of arms. It is my hope. Mr. Speaker. in speaking out before the House today. to. in some small way. add my own voice. representing the people of Hudson County and New Jerseys 14th Congrepional District. In supporting the nomination of Lech Walesa for the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize. In a letter dated October 7. 1981 from Solidarnosc Headquarters. in Gdansk. Poland. Lech Walesa sent me the following letter: Dear Mr. Guarini. Thank you very much for your cordial letter and tribute you paid to me but first of all I am happy to hear that you approve the activities of our indeperdent. selfgoverned union. AllI of us are very grateful for the moral support of aims and tasks we declared and which must be of concern to all who are interested in justice. Thanks to your letter and many others from the U.S.A. and all over the world our union is becoming stronger and aware that in our struggle for human rights and dignity we are not alone. It Is the source of hope for us that these aims should be achieved not in Poland only but also in other countries. I am absolutely convinced that the proposal of mutual cooperation you suggested and I accept with great pleasure will serve the cause of pence. justice and freedom of all the people. I hope that my visit to the U.S.A. will help to achieve our aims. I am grateful. Sir that you supported my nomination for the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize. This is a matter of great Importance. particular for the whole of ""solidarity"" as the union. much more than for me. personally. Thank you for the American flag and the photos you enclosed. I extend our best wishes for you and all the ""Solidaritys"" friends in the U.S.A.. I remain. Sincerely. Lech Walesa. Chairman of NSZZ ""Solidarnosn"". During the past few years contact has been maintained by mail and by Individuals visiting Poland. Roger Castor. a student at Jersey City State College. studying with the Kosciuszko Foundation In Poland. on two occasions brought messages and gifts of an American flag and Royal Doulton Bunnykins Sent for their new born child. The Hudson County Central Labor Union. through the leadership of Al Beck. President. and Edward Pulver. SecretaryTreasurer of the AFLCIO. received Stanislaw Walesa and me when we presented an enlargement of the U.S. postage labor stamp which was issued by the U.S. Postal Service. This message was brought to Lech Walesa in Poland. On another occasion. January 1981. when Lech was invited to visit with Pope John Paul II. he -sent for his father In Jersey City to make the historic visit. It was on that occasion that I sent this message to His Holiness. on behalf of all the people of Hudson County. New Jersey. as follows: To His Holiness. Pope John Paul II. On behalf of all the people of Hudson County. New Jersey. I wish to express our gratefulness for your great inspiration and leadership for a peaceful world. We need your blessings and constant intercession. Pray for US. Over the past 2 years I have reported messages from Lech Walesa to community leaders In my area. such as Jean Kozmor of the Jersey City Chapter of the Polish National Alliance. Thomas Wojslawowicz. national director of the Polish American Congress. William Kowalski. Stanley Kosakowski of WSOU Radio. Stanley Arsulowicz. of Bayonne Chapter of Polish American Congress. Marion Marawski of the Jersey City Chapter of Polish American Congress. Joseph Plonski. past state commander of the Polish Legion of American Veterans. Joseph Sluka. Father Leonard Mbodowski. associate pastor of St. Anns Polish R. C. Church. Col. Anthony Podbielski of the Bayonne Chapter of Polish American Congress. Edward Warlikowski of the Polish American Progress Association. and Father Walter Niedzwiecki. pastor of Our Lady of Czestochowa Church. Jersey City. Who would Imagine that the child born In Popowo. a tiny village in Poland. with no square but a tiny road running through the center. would be placed in the Illustrious company of past prize winners including the following: Theodore Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson. Cordell Hull. Ralph J. Bunche. Albert Schweitzer. George C. Marshall. Dag Hammarskjold. Martin Luther King. Jr.. Willy Brandt. Henry Kissinger. Anwar Sadat. Menachern Begin. and Mother Theresa of Calcutta. Lech Walesas contributions for the cause of human rights and world peace in both inspirational and an outstanding example of service above self. His announced intention of donating the almost $200.000 In prize money to his beloved church in Poland is further proof of his desire to serve both God and man. I am sure that my colleagues in Congress and millions of freedom loving people throughout the world Join me in wishing Lech Walesa ""Sto Lat."" May you live 100 years.*"
980125696,"Mr. Speaker. I wish to share my joy and pleasure observing the 50th anniversary of a dear friend and a true servant of God and man. On Sunday. November 6. 1983. Reverend Victor R. Yanitelli. S.J.. will be honored on the occasion of his 50th anniversary as a member of the Society of Jesus. The festivities will begin at 12 noon with a mass in the chapel at St. Peters College. followed by a reception and dinner in the Pavonia room at the college. Father Vie. as he Is affectionately known by his friends. has had a very fruitful and dedicated life in the service of others. His career has been an Illustrious one serving his God and his fellow man. Father Vie was born In New York City of Italian immigrant parents on December 16. 1914. He attended Fordham Prep where he graduated In June of 1933. The following September. he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Wernersville. Pa.. where he prepared for the Jesuit priesthood. After 7 years of study. he taught modern languages at Fordhamn Prep between 1940 and 1943. In 1943. he went to Woodstock College ~SSIONAL RECORD - Extensions in Maryland to do his final theological studies In preparation for ordination which took place In the spring of 1948. During the 1950s. Father Vic served as an instructor of both French and Italian at Fordham University. In 1953. he became director of student personnel. In 1958. he was promoted to the position of vice president for student personnel. Father Vie was one of the first college administrators In the country to see the importance of the student personnel office. where he developed programsto work with students to Improve their environment while they attended college. In 1963. Father Vie moved from Fordham University to St. Peters College where he served as director of student personel services until September of 1965 when he was appointed president. St. Peters College was truly fortunate to have Father Vie as its president. During his tenture from 1965 to 1978. the college grew both physically and spiritually. The number of students doubled and the number of buildings quadrupled. Father Vie became an Integral part of Jersey City. Hudson County and the State of New Jersey. During these years. he served as a member of the board of managers of the Jersey City Medical Center. the board of directors of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. vice president of the Jersey City Board of Education. chapter chairman of the Jersey City Chapter of the American Red Cross. and treasurer of the New Jersey Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. He became a life member of the NAACP. an honorary member of the Knights of Pythias. a member of the board of directors of the Jersey City Chamber of Commerce and the Garden State National Bank. as well as Seatrain. Inc. IN 1973. Father Vie was appointed by New Jersey Gov. William Cahill as a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He was reappointed to this position in 1975 by Gov. Brendani Byrne. In every way. Father Vie contributed to the spiritual and physical needs of the community he served. He was an inspiration to students. faculty and administrators at St. Peters College because of his involvement and concern for the poor and the downtrodden. In 1978. Father Yanitelli resigned his position as president of St. Peters College and became chancellor of the college where he dedicated his abilities to guaranteeing the future financial stability of St. Peters College. He continued his community activities and continued to be the confidant and counselor of the leaders of both business and government In the State of New Jersey. In 1980. the Society of Jesus called Father Yanitelli to be pastor of St. Ignatius Loyola parish. which is located on Park Avenue In New York City. Here he faced a new challenge. No of Remarks E 5293 longer was he Involved with the education of the young. Now he was Involved with fulfilling the needs of those older Christians who were trying to find a direction in their lives. Father Vie met the challenge and enthusiastically became involved in parish council and school activities. In 1981. Terence Cardinal Cooke selected Father Vie to become the vicar of east Manhattan where he became responsible for the spiritual well being of parishioners of over 20 parishes located In the central part of east Manhattan. Father Vie is still as enthusiastic and energetic today as he was when he entered the novitiate In 1933. He continues to live his life based upon the principles of St. Ignatius Loyola. the founder of the order of which he is a member. The Jesuit motto. ""To the Greater Glory of God"" has been his guiding principle and his life Is an example of this motto. I appreciate the input of my dear friend Assemblyman Jeseph V. Doria. Jr.. an administrator at St. Peters College and a very dear friend of Father Vie. In preparing this message. With his departure from Jersey City an era was ended in New Jersey but. however. since he went back across the river. a new light seems to be shining there. Indeed a jewel was added to Father Vies crown when in 1976 St. Peters College completed construction of it.6 recreational life center which has been named in his honor. This center combines all the qualities which mark Father Vies remarkable humaneness and accessibility to others. shattering the stereotype of some college presidents who appear distant and unapproachable. His openness has been a trademark of his leadership In any community he has served. I believe the following to be a most appropriate editorial which appeared in the Jersey Journal shortly after the announcement that Father Yanitelli would leave Jersey City. It reads: The Rev. Victor Yanitelli. S.J.. Is leaving Jersey City after 17? years and he will be missed. He leaves more than a recreation center bearing his name. His contributic n to St. Peters College and to Jersey City will continue to benefit both in the years to come. He came within a couple of heartbeats of being mayor of Jersey City and who knows what he might have accomplished in that office with his warmth. sincerity. considerable Intelligence and his invaluable gift of Inspiring the confidence and cooperation of others? Honesty rubs off from Father Vie. When you think and talk about him you find yourself being more honest with himand yourselfthan you normally are. That makes It easier to say Father Vie had a lot of friends and there also are many who are not exactly friendly toward him. Many. for example. considered him ""a black vote"" on the Jersey City Board of Education. Others say he has not been outspoken enough as a Port Authority commissioner. Think about it and you realize the first criticism means he helped minorities and the second. that he Is a diplomat."
980156388,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to make known a volunteer program which has been in effect since 1967 in the Hudson County area. wherein a very dedicated constituent has provided opera programs. The remarkable individual I refer to is Mrs. Josephine Ruffino of North Bergen. While the calendar may put her in the status of being an ""older American."" She indeed displays boundless energy. operating a remarkable organization. known as the Family Opera. This group has dedicated themselves to producing outstanding operas. filling a void in our area. In addition to the professional performances. the remarkable part of the Family Opera is that no tickets are sold. no one is paid. as the only income is derived from voluntary contributions and donations.

Holbrook. or the New York City Opera. whose general director is our beloved Beverly Sills. or the tremendous Metropolitan Opera Association of New York City. directed by Anthony Bliss. they indeed have the same love of music and people. Mrs. Ruffino is fortunate to have the professionalism of Dr. Herman Schlisserman as musical director. whose boundless energy matches that of Mrs. Ruffino. His musical direction of the one and only Swiss Bond of Hudson County. with more than 90 years of community service. is renown. In addition to the packed house they have each Sunday at the Park Theater in Union City. with a 1.000seat capacity. the Family Opera has brought a message of beauty through music. the international language. to hospital groups. high school students. and older Americans. who have enjoyed performances which included ballet. an important part of the company. Josephine Ruffino and the Family Opera have a continuing problem which they face with great trepidation. They have indeed been fortunate in the past to have the assistance of Mr. Arthur Imperatore. president of the A.P.A. Transport Co.. who is a true lover of the arts. He has assisted on many occasions. helping to provide funds and wherewithal to continue the beautiful music program. A turning point in Mrs. Ruffinos life occurred in 1953 when she was involved in an automobile accident. which resulted in a long period of hospitalization. Dr. Herman Schlisserman provided medical care and it was there they joined in the musical programs. A graduate of Julliard School of Music. Dr. Schlisserman has provided the professionalism and determination with resulting perfect performances. Mrs. Ruffino. meanwhile. has assured the many tasks coordinating the musicians. the lights. props. scenery. costumes. public relations. and raising the limited funds needed for their annual programs. Josephine is the proud mother of three children. Russell Ruffino. Ph. February 2S. 1984 D.. AiAthony Ruffino. a member of the U.S. Marines during the Korean conflict. and Jacqueline Ruffino. who is in a supervisory position for the U.S. Navy. Bureau for Medicine and Surgery at the Pentagon. She is a member of Our Lady of Fatima Church in North Bergen. a member of the U.S. Marines and Navy Mothers Club. and the N.J. Federation of Business and Professional Women. For her efforts she was awarded a community service citation for outstanding citizenship by the New Jersey State Department of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. A highlight in her community career has been a personal invitation from former Speaker of the House John McCormack to visit the White House through the efforts of former Congressman Dominick V. Daniels of the 14th District. The Family Opera. under Josephines direction. and with Dr. Schlissermans input personifies service to the community and a love of life which is echoed constantly through their musical programs. Charles Kingsley said: Music has been called the speech of angels. I will go further and call it the speech of God Himself. Josephine. through her dedication indeed echoes the words of Dora Flick Flood: Music is Natures love and tears transformed Into Harmonies that reach the spirit of man. And Platos reminder that: Music to the mind is as air to the body. Mrs. Ruffinos efforts is volunteerism at its best. More importantly. however. is the ripple effect she causes instilling the same spirit in many individuals. urging them to accept their responsibilities to work for community causes. I urge all my colleagues here in the House of Representatives to join with me in thanking Josephine Ruffino and urging the continuation of her beautiful work. bringing music. which has been so beautifully described by John S. Dwight: Music is to me an ethereal rain. an eversoft distillation. fragrant and liquid and wholesome to the soul. as dew to flowers. in incomprehensible delight. a joy. a voice of mystery. that seems to stand on the boundary between the sphere of the senses and the soul. and plead with pure. unrefined human nature to ascend into regions of seraphic uncontained life. 0 wondrous power! Art thou not the nearest brea.h of Gods own beauty. born to us amid the infinite. whispering gallery of His reconciliation! Type of all love and reconcillation. solvent. of hard. contrary elementsblender of soul with soul. and all with the Infinite Harmony.e"
980169133,"Mr. Speaker. it is with a profound sense of loss that we gather together today to honor one of the most courageous. conscientious. and forthright men of our time. the late Clarence M. Mitchell. Jr. As one of Americas foremost civil rights activists. Mr. Mitchell acted as the gentle. if persistent. conscience of us all. Truly he. as much as anyone else. guided us as a nation to a fuller realization of the concept of justice and equality for all Americans. Clarence Mitchell devoted his life to the fight against discrimination. As head of the Washington office of the NAACP and through the widely renowned public interest coalition he founded. the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. he worked the halls of Washington as effectively as other leaders. such as Martin Luther King. Jr.. worked the hearts and souls of the countryside. I remember clearly the tireless work of leaders in the civil rights movement in my home State of New Jersey. such as Rev. Dr. Ercel Webb. Counselor Raymond Brown. the late former Jersey City Councilman Fred Martin. Julian Robinson. the vice president of Jersey City State College. Thomas Taylor and Dr. William G. Wilkerson of the Jersey City NAACP. and Educator Gladys Cannon Nunnery. Jersey City Police Sergeant Charles Jackson was a member of Dr. Kings honor guard. and has been memorialized forever in the famous photograph of Dr. King in Washington at his ""I have a Dream"" speech. While the efforts of these brave men and women helped generate the grassroots demand for legal justice. it was Clarence Mitchell who helped craft the legislation which gave Federal teeth to the antidiscrimination movement. Although primarily recognized as a legal expert. he was not averse to direct action to bring results. He physically helped desegregate Baltimore schools. where he spent most of his life. and was arrested for ignoring discriminatory restrictions in South Carolina. But. as quoted in the Washington Post. he stressed. ""Youve got to know wihen to stop picketing and sit down at the conference table."" It was h! leadership at that conference table where he was the most effective of all in bringing about civil change. During those stirring years. Clarence Mitchell was known as the 101st Senator. and his dignified bearing and knowledge of the issues lent truth to that impression. He assembled the coalitions of diverse individuals that en. gineered the legislative triumphs of the civil rights movement. Thorough and persistent. he suffered through many years of rejection for his foresightful crusade. yet he never gave up the fight. Even after those difficult years. during the time when the voices of justice began to be heard. Mitchell had the graciousness to have only kind words for all but the most spiteful of the foes of equality. He earned the respect of both sides. His accomplishments are legion. for he has a long and important list Lf legislation which owe their being to his efforts. Beginning in World War II. he helped enforce Presidential orders to integrate the shipyards which built the arsenal of democracy. He promoted President Trumans Executive order to desegregate the Armed Forces. He guided the passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Act. which gave momentum to the fight against discrimination. He was widely recognized as one of the leading forces behind the 1961 legislation which established the Federal Civil Rights Commission. Later. he crafted legislation which required equal employment opportunity. Thcn. as his years of efforts were being endorsed by millions of concerned Americans who marched in our streets. he helped gather those forces behind the landmark civil rights legislation of the Johnson years. Through the work of Clarence Mitchell. we have a whole new generation of Americans who are committed to freedom and justice for all. While the battle is not yet over. we see progress. many younger Americans. black. brown. white. red. and yellow. who were brought up in a more enlightened society. will not stand for the slights and obstacles which were once. unfortunately. a way of this land. Mr. Mitchells work lives on through the men and women he nurtured and through todays new activities. Indeed. through the work of Mr. Mitchell. Dr. King. Rev. Dr. Webb. Counselor Brown. Julian Robinson. Thomas Taylor. Dr. Wilkerson. Mrs. Nunnery. Fred Martin. and Sergeant Jackson. and countless others who labored in the vineyards it is clear that whatever our color. we all bleed red for freedoms sake. My heartfelt condolences go out to Mr. Mitchells wife Juanita and their sons. I especially feel for my good friend and colleague. Clarences brother PARREN. who has come to visit my district and who has gained many friends and admirers there. PARRENS commitment to Justice is equally strong. it is apparent that the senior Mitchells raised a family of dedicated and concerned citizens. We will all miss Clarence Mitchell sorely. Yet. he leaves behind a most precious gift: the heightened consciousness of our Nation. which now. through the work of this great man. adheres more strongly to the values I II12012 our Founding Fathers sought to establish. How better to be remembered and honored?e"

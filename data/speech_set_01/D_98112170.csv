980008990,Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1718. the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1983. providing jobs and humanitarian relief for the millions of Americans who now find themselves without work and without hope of securing a job in the near future. Our Nation has just emerged from the depths of one of the deepest recessions evera recession which has cut a wide swath of misery and human suffering touching nearly every American family. As a result. of the Nations slide into economic chaos. a record 18 million Americans find themselves out of work or working part time because no fulltime jobs are available. People have lost their homes and their self respect. Unemployed workers have had to leave their families. moving from town to town and State to State looking for work. Families have had to forego not the luxuries. but the basic necessities of life. such as food and medical care. Yes. Mr. Chairman. an emergency jobs bill should have passed long. long ago before unemployment escalated into Americas No. 1 domestic tragedybefore thousands of families were pushed over the edge of economic disaster. H.R. 1718 is a long overdue and a much needed step. but still a small step. I strongly believe that Congress has a responsibility and an obligation to do much more than this because our Nation is only as strong as its people. And. our people need and deserve more help from their Government than this limited bill can provide. H-.R. 1718 takes one small step. but a giant leap is needed. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. I urge this body to pass the measure before us as only phase 1 of an employment and economic stimulus package. and I urge my colleagues to press for phase 2 legislationas I will be doingto complete the task of providing real relief to the American people. Now. I would like to address my remarks to some of the specific provisions of the bill before us. which provides $4.6 billion in emergency jobcreating appropriations. humanitarian relief. and an emergency supplemental to keep the unemployment compensation system from running out of funds this spring. There are some who believe that this measure is not targeted sufficiently to communities experiencing very high unemployment. They may or may not be right. I do know. however. that there are a number of provisions in H.R. 1718 which will provide important and significant aid to Ohio and to Clevelandmy own State and congressional districtcurrently experiencing the pain of nearly the highest unemployment rates in the country. For example. Ohio and Cleveland will benefit significantly from the $1.25 billion appropriation in H.R. 1718 for community development block grants. Clevelands share of about $12 million will provide jobs for housing rehabilitation. parks improvements. and other projects essential to maintaining the vitality of Clevelands neighborhoods. This bill also - disapproves a deferral in UDAG funds for which Cleveland has a number of applications pending. These projects can be implemented quickly and will create many needed construction jobs in Cleveland. The $232.4 million for employment and training assistance in this bill is already targeted to high unemployment areas under existing formulas for summer youth and displaced worker programs. About 50.000 to 60.000 persons in Cleveland qualify for this type of job training assistance and some will benefit from the funds provided in this measure. Mr. Chairman. several days ago I participated in a walking tour of several hunger service centers in Cleveland and the things I saw were shocking. Clevelanders are routinely waiting 2 hours for free Government cheese and bread. church soup kitchens and hunger centers are filled to capacity. Several thousand women in Cleveland are on the waiting list for nutritious food supplements under the WIC program. Mr. Chairman. it became painfully clear to me that the $75 million for the distribution of surplus food. the $50 million for emergency food and shelter services. and the $100 million for WIC included in H.R. 1718 will only begin to address the need for emergency assistance which exists in Cleveland and in the Nation. Cleveland and Ohio also desperately require congressional approval of the $5.033 billion in this bill for advances to the States for unemployment compensation benefits. The onerous burden of nearly 15 percent unemployment has forced Ohio to borrow heavily from the Federal Government to meet unemployment compensation payments. The approval of this supplemental funding will enable Ohio and 28 other States to continue lifesustaining unemployment compensation benefits to thousands of people who have no other resources. In closing. Mr. Chairman. I believe strongly that congressional passage of this bill is critical to my own community. Cleveland. to the State of Ohio. and to the Nation. I urge its swift adoption. granting essential jobs and relief to the unfortunate victims of the Nations economic problems.e
980013929,Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation to require the National Highway Traffic -Safety Administration to provide for the establishment. by States. of motor vehicle title and inspection requirements in order to promote traffic safety and deter motor vehicle theft. Motor vehicle theft has reached a state of epidemic proportions. In America. today. 1.1 million or 1 out of every 43 registered motor vehicles. its contents. or accessories is being stolen annually. Statistically. that translates into a motor vehicle theft every 28 seconds at an annual cost to the American public of $4 billion in increased law enforcement costs and higher insurance costs. Twenty years r.go. motor vehicle theft was primarily a juvenile crime approximately F.4 percent attributable to joyriders. Irn the 1980s motor vehicle theft has become increasingly professional with the recovery rate down to 55.5 percent. the lowest in history. The rate at which these crimes are solved is down to 12.6 percent. This is also an alltime low. Police and other law enforcement agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to recover stolen motor vehicles and solve motor vehicle crimes because. inost frequently. the stolen motor vehicles are being: First. chopped into their component parts with the result that identifiable portions no longer exist. second. altered and given a new identity. then fraudulently retitled. and/or. third. exported and therefore no longer in the country. In addition to the problem of theft and insurance fraud there is the everIncreasing hazardous condition created by motor vehicles which have been extensively damaged or diamantled and then replaced with stolen parts. Frequently. these repairs have been made in a faulty manner and fail to meet the highway roadworthiness test and therefore are not safe. Many of these vehicles are being sold to purchasers who are unaware of the salvage history of the vehicle. This bill establishes motor vehicle title and inspection requirements and procedures which will improve traffic safety by identifying motor vehicles which may be unsafe because necessary repairs have not been made or have been carried out in a faulty manner. It provides for the establishment of a system for canceling the title when the vehicle becomes nonsalvable and prohibits the operation of such vehicle on the highway. Provision is made for a salvage motor vehicle to be repaired or otherwise restored to a condition suitable for highway operation after inspection by the appropriate State agency. The vehicle would then be given a salvage vehicle title which gives notice of its prior condition. States would be required to establish a system for titling and inspecting vehicles which have been titled in another State. Sales of motor vehicle parts would be prohibited when State or federally required identification numbers are missing. Insurance companies would be granted immunity from civil suit for releasing information relating to motor vehicle theft or accidents under investigation. States are initially encouraged to establish motor vehicle and inspection programs on a voluntary basis. However. if a State fails to establish a program which meets with the approval and certification of the Administrator within 2 years after the enactment of this act. then the Administrator is required to take such steps as are necessary to prepare and administer the State program in accordance with this act. Highway safety can be promoted and motor vehicle theft can be reduced only by breaking the connection between the theft and the lucrative illegal dealings that take place after the theft. Law enforcement agencies have repeatedly given assurance that one way of breaking this connection would be the enactment of State laws which would require the cancellation of titles for extensively damaged or dismantled motor vehicles. Thousands of car owners throughout America are hopeful that we can alleviate the theft problem and also improve highway safety. This legislation is a response to that hope.e
980046333,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong opposition to House Concurrent Resolution 113. which would release fiscal year 1983 appropriations for MX missile basing activities and flight testing. Last year. Congress in great wisdom acted to prohibit the release of these funds. about $625 million. until President Reagan proposed an acceptable and workable perma nent basing plan for the MX missile. Congress was well justified in being skeptcal about committing billions of scarce Federal dollars to a costly. new weapons system of questionable benefit to our national security. Congress was right to be skeptical about the MX when even the Pentagon has been hardpressed to develop a rational plan for its deployment which is more than simply creating an attractive target for the Soviet Union to shoot at. Indeed. the debate over a proper basing mode for the MX missile has a long history in which many imaginative. but unworkable schemes have been proposed. In fact. the Pentagon has looked at over 30 such schemes to make the MX invulnerable to attack. None have survived a careful and logical scrutiny. including the ridiculous Dense Pack basing mode proposed by President Reagan last year. Now. we have come full circle to the recommendation of the Presidents Scowcroft Commission to base the MX in hardened Minuteman missile silos. a recommendation which Congress wisely rejected 2 years ago and should reject now. The fact that. after years of study. discussion. and debate. a feasible and rational basing mode for the MX missile has yet to be devised should give us all great pause as to whether the MX missile can ever be deployed successfully to survive a Soviet attack. Mr. Chairman. I believe that we already know the answers regarding this issue. The Scowcroft Commission has already admitted that there is no such thing as a invulnerable landbase missile silo. The Air Force has already estimated that by the time these multibillion missiles are deployed only 1 MX out of 100 would survive a Soviet first strike. Mr. Chairman. I hope that Congress will reject House Concurrent Resolution 113. My opposition to this resolution. however. extends far beyond the issue of how to deploy the MX missile. I fundamentally deplore the production and deployment of the MX missile. irrespective of its basing mode. because. in my view. the MX missile is a dangerous and outrageously expensive weapon of little or marginal value to our national security. Certainly the security risks of our Nation posed by the production and deployment of this destabilizing weapon will outweigh greatly the dubious military benefits which might be derived from its development. The MX missile will not improve our countrys military postufe. Administration officials have said that the MX weapon system is vulnerable to attack and survivable only with a launchonwarning strategy. which carries with it a grave risk of accidental war. Thus. the major reason initially advanced for developing the MX missileits survivabilityhas now been abandoned. With a price tag conservatively estimated at $15 billion over the next 5 years. we should now abandon the MX system in its entirety. Since the start of the Reagan administration. the administrations commitment to defense spending has been extraordinary. The fiscal year 1984 proposed defense budget authority of $280.5 billion Is nearly double the level authorized in fiscal year 1980. More importantly. we are now on a path of spending the mindboggling amount of more than $1.6 trillion on defense needs over the next 5 years. Thus. I reject the notion advanced by some that we need the MX missile to correct a military imbalance between the Soviets and the United States. I believe that no such imbalance exists. While the Soviets may have an ""advantage"" in prompt. hardtarget kill capability. the United States is superior both qualitatively and quantitatively in submarinebased forces and in strategic aircraft. Moreover. recent and planned improvements in U.S. military forces include the B1 and stealth bombers. Pershing II. and stealth cruise missiles. the retrofitting of Minutemen III missiles. and new sealaunched Trident missiles. Both the United States and the Soviets have morenuclear warheads than are necessary for overall deterrence. Mr. Chairman. in addition to the fact that the MX missile will not enhance our military capability. the production and deployment of the MX missile represents a significant jeopardy to nuclear arms control. I vehemently disagree with the Scowcroft Commission recommendation that the MX will provide a useful bargaining chip with the Soviets on negotiating a serious arms control agreement. Rather than luring the Soviets to the bargaining table. the MX missile would more likely threaten the Soviets and invite a preemptive attack from them in a crisis. Moreover. concentrating these high value weapons in a vulnerable basing mode would create a very attractive target for a Soviet first strike. In short. MX production and deployment could have a perilous and destabilizing impact. enhancing the chances of nuclear war. rather than limiting those chances. Mr. Chairman. I believe that the entire MX program should be cancelled immediately. A vote against House Concurrent Resolution 113 would be a significant first step toward .this end and would demonstrate a Congressional will to act in the best interests of the American people. Our Nation. Mr. Chairman. has viable options which can improve our military strength and also lead us down the path to world peace. The development of the MX missile. however. is not one of these options. I urge the rejection of this resolution.e"
980047198,Mr. Chairman. today. the House of Representatives considers H.R. 3069. the fiscal year 1983 supplemental appropriations bill. This measure includes an appropriation of $9.4 million for the Cleveland Veterais Administration Medical center at Wrade Park. I strongly support the inclusion of these funds in this bill at this time and commend Congressman EDWARD BOLAND. chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on HUDIndependent Agencies. and the other subcommittee members for their cooperation and assistance in recognizing the importance of this funding to the veterans in the Cleveland. Ohio area. Mr. Chairman. the veterans in northeast Ohio have had to suffer for too long because of poor conditions at the Wade Park facility. Fire and safety hazards. including the lack of a sprinkler system and fire escapes at the end of several dead end corridors. threaten the safety of the veterans who use the hospital. Moreover. the hospital wards are dangerously overcrowded. Even patients using the outpatient clinic experience excessive delays in receiving both treatment and pharmaceutical services. The $9.4 million provided in H.R. 3069 will finance the construction of a new clinical addition to the existing veterans medical facility at Wade Park. The construction project will help to correct the existing fire and safety deficiencies by providing for the relocation of the surgical suite at the hospital. It will also help alleviate the crowded patient facilities with expanded outpatient. clinical laboratory. bed service. and pharmacy space. Ifr. Chairman. for the past 3 years. I have worked aggressively to resolve some of the problems that have plagued the Wade Park Veterans Administration Medical Center. In 1980. I held hearings at the hospital in regard to employee and patient complaints. One of the major complaints at that time was the need for expanded services and facilities at the hospital. In 1981. I authored language which was included in the House report accompanying the fiscal year 1982 HUDindependent agencies appropriations bill instructing the Veterans Administration to advance the Cleveland clinical addition project on its priority list. In 1982. my colleagues on the HUD Appropriations Subcommittee agreed with me that $9.75 million should be appropriated in fiscal year 1983 for this project and recommended the necessary funding in the regular fiscal year 1983 HUDindependent agencies appropriations bill. Last year. this appropriation was later deleted from the bill in conference with the Senate. However. the House and Senate conferees did agree that the Cleveland project should go forward with funds appropriated in the first available appropriation legislation. provided that the administration submitted a budget request for the project. Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to say that the Administration has endorsed the need for the Cleveland clinical addition project and that the fiscal year 1984 Veterans Administration budget estimate does indeed include a request of $9.4 million for the necessary design studies. working drawings and construction. Thus. the recommendation to appropriate $9.4 million in H.R. 3069 in accordance with the agreement worked out with the Senate last year in the conference report on H.R. 6956. the fiscal year 1983 HUDindependent agencies appropriations bill. I am delighted that the Committee has recognized the vital need to improve the veterans medical care facilities in Cleveland. Additionally. I believe that the HUD Appropriations Subcommittee has exercised leadership and foresight in recommending that the director of the Cleveland Veterans Medical Center be allowed complete management responsibility for the clinical addition project. such that the construction will be administered locally rather than here in Washington. D.C. This arrangement has worked well and with cost savings in other Veterans Administration construction projects. I am confident that local management responsibility in Cleveland will result in a more effectively administered project in this case as well. Mr. Chairman. for a small price. the funds provided in H.R. 3069 will address a grave need among the veterans in Cleveland for a better and safer environment in which to receive medical treatment. I urge approval of this appropriation so that this .essential and innovative initiative may proceed.*
980065740,Mr. Speaker. I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding to me. First. let me say that as the distinguished gentleman from Florida has said. his committee did write to the Ethics Committee and request that we investigate the matters under discussion at this time. Prior to that. we had received another letter signed by all three committee chairmen asking the Ethics Committee to conduct this investigation. Pursuant to the receipt of the first letter. I convened the Ethics Committee and presented the letter signed by all three chairmen to them. at which time the entire committee engaged in discussion relative to the investigation. It was the unanimous opinion of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct that they should conduct this investigation. that our committee was the proper committee to investigate this matter and that. in fact. the allegations did. in fact. impinge upon the integrity of the House. and for that reason we had authority to conduct the investigation. I presented to the committee at that time a resolution which we had drawn up to give us the broad powers we would need to conduct this kind of an investigation for the House. The committee discussed the resolution and agreed upon the introduction of the resolution. It was suggested to me. however. that rather than to follow the usual procedure of the ranking minority member from South Carolina and I introducing the resolution. that we should attempt in this case because of the serious nature of it to get the three ranking minority members of all three committees to join in the cosponsorship of that resolution. Pursuant to that. the gentleman from South Carolina then agreed to undertake the matter of trying to get the leadership on the other side to work with him in order to try to get the three ranking minority members to sign on that resolution. The resolution has been prepared now for almost a week. I have not been able to introduce It for the reason that I have not been able to get the concurrence and the cosponsorship of the three ranking Republican Members. We are prepared at this time to introduce the resolution. We are prepared to go forward with the investigation. but we need from the House the broad powers that are necessary to conduct this kind of an investigation. We have come to the House in every investigation with such a resolution and we have been given broad powes
980074361,"Mr. Speaker. in the course of our investigation the committee received evidence that in 1973 Representative STUDDs engaged in a sexual relationship with a 17yearold male pagewho may have been 16 when the relationship beganand made sexual advances to two other male pages. one was 16 or 17 years old at the time and the other was 17 years old. I will briefly summarize the facts of those events. A former page testified under oath that he had a sexual relationship with Representative STUDDS while serving as a House page during the spring and summer of 1973. This individual had been a congressional page in the House during the spring and summer of 1973. He was 16 when he was appointed as a page. The page testified that another page introduced him to Representative STUDDs and a group of other Congressmen at a restaurant in May or June 1973. According to the pages testimony under oath. sometime after this Introduction. Representative STUDDS invited the page to the Representatives house in Georgetown for dinner. After dinner. Representative STUDDS and the page drank alcoholic beverages until 4 a.m. Representative STUDDS told the page that he was too drunk to drive him home and suggested that the page sleep at Representative STUDDs apartment. At that point. according to the pages testimony. Representative STUDDS engaged him in sexual activity. The page testified that they had dinner three or four additional times and engaged in sexual activity each time. The page testified that he did not feel intimidated or coerced by Representative STUDDS nor did Representative STUDDS offer any preferential treatment. But he did say that he would rather have had the friendship with Representative STUDDs without the sex. which he said he was ""somewhat uncomfortable with."" According to the pages testimony. his sexual relationship with Representative STUDDs continued during a trip they took together in August 1973. The evidence does not indicate that any official funds were used for the trip. The page testified that he paid his own airfare to Europe. and a portion of the cost of meals and lodging with Representative STUDDS. The page testified that their relationship ended when they returned to the United States. The page testified that he is not homosexual and he had not had a homosexual relationship prior to his relationship with Representative STUDDS. The Special Counsel also received testimony under oath from two other former pages that Representative STUDDS made sexual advances to them In 1973. Each testified that he rejected the advance. First page: This individual was a page in the House from mid1972 through mid1974. He became 17 years old in the spring of 1973. He testified under oath at his deposition that he met Representative STUDDS one evening in 1973 at a restaurant or bar on Capitol Hill. while with a group of other pages. According to the pages sworn testimony. as the group of pages -broke up later In the evening. Representative STUDDS offered to drive him home. The page accepted the offer. But instead of driving to the pages home. Representative STUDDS drove to his own home where he and the page continued to drink and talk from 1% to 3 hours. According to the pages sworn testimony. Representative STUDDS then made a remark which the page interpreted as a sexual proposition. At the time the incident occurred. the page told at least two other individuals about it. one of whom was a staff member in the Doorkeepers Office. Second page: This page was also a congressional page in the House from mid1971 through mid1973. He was 17 years old in the spring of 1973. In a sworn statement. this individual stated that. one evening after a late House session in the spring of 1973. he went to a bar on Captiol Hill. He joined a group of individuals that included Representative STUDDS and a number of pages. House staffers. and Members of Congress. According to the pages sworn statement. he and Representative STUDDS. along with the others present. consumed a large quantity of alcohol in the course of the evening. The page stated under oath that at the end of the evening. Representative STUDDs offered to drive him and another page to their homes. Both pages accepted the offer. After dropping the other page off. Representative STUDDS invited this page to Representative STUDDs house for another drink. At the house. the page stated that Representative STUDDS poured alcoholic drinks for himself and the page. and made a sexual proposition to the page. which the page declined. The page said that he told at least one other page about the experience. The page whom he told about the experience testified that he informed a staff member in the Doorkeepers Office about the incident. Representative STUDDS and his attorney appeared before the committee. Representative STUDDS. through his attorneys. stated that he ""does not contest the fact of a sexual relationship with a page in 1973 and sexual advances to two other pages in 1973."" In light of Representative STUDDS admissions. the Special Counsel proposed and Representative STUDDS RCcepted a shortened procedure in order to protect the identity of the young pages involved. Representative STUDDS waived his right under the committee rules to a statement of alleged violation and to a public hearing before the committee. Representative STUDDS agreed that the committee could make its recommendation to the House on the basis of its Special Counsels report and on submissions to the committee by him and his attorneys. Based on the evidence. the committee found that in 1973 Representative STUDDS engaged in a consensual sexual relationship with a 17yearold male pagewho may have been 16 years old when the relationship beganand made sexual advances to two other male pages. The committee found that this was improper sexual conduct under House Resolution 518 of the 97th Congress and House Resolution 12 of the 98th Congress and that this conduct violated Representative STUDDS official obligation as a Member of the House of Representatives and constituted conduct that does not ""reflect creditably on the House of Representatives"" in violation of clause 1 of the Code of Official Conduct of the House. Mr. Speaker. the committee in its deliberations recognized that the conduct of Representative STUDDS involved a sexual relationship with a teenage page. as well as sexual advances to two others. and. in each of these instances. the excessive use of alcohol. But 10 years has passed since these events took place. While the House does not recognize any statute of limitations in considering the official conduct of its Members. the House must consider the length of time since the misconduct occurred in deciding on an appropriate sanction. In addition. Representative STUDDs has not contested the facts and cooperated with the committees investigation and its efforts to protect the identity of the pages involved. Mr. Speaker. these are not easy judgments to make. They require a judicious balancing of many factors. In the committees judgment. strong action Is required to condemn Representative STUDDS conduct. The committees decision to make the facts public and to recommend a reprimand constitutes in my judgment appropriate -punishment for Representative STUDDs serious violation of the Houses Code of Conduct. I urge the House to agree to House Resolution Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."
980108265,I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would like to say to our distinguished chairman ift the well. that 1. too. join with my colleague from Cleveland In commending the gentleman and the gentleman from New Jersey on the authorizing side for this excellent legislation that has been brought to the floor. I would like to say to the gentleman that it is our expectation that the project to be funded be based on the approved project report relative to the Cleveland. Ohio harbor project. which would modify the east and west entrances of the Cleveland Harbor and extend the breakwall at the extreme east end of the harbor. The successful completion of this project will provide the city of Cleveland with an allweather harbor that will serve the area for decades to come. We deeply appreciate all the consideration that the gentleman and the committee have given us In this matter. Mr. Chairman. I also rise to express my support of H.R. 3958. the Water Resources Development Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1984. This measure approves funding for a longawaited Improvement project for the Cleveland Harbor. As many of my colleagues know. the Cleveland Port is a very important specialized Port. serving as a major transportation link to primarily the steel industry. Over 1.200 vessels and tankers from over 50 countries and 120 world ports arrive annually at the docks lining the lakes shore and the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Cleveland Port is the. largest Iron ore receiving Port on the Great Lakes. and ranks fifth among all the Great Lakes ports in overall tonnage. Mr. Chairman. the activity of the Cleveland Harbor is closely linked to the economic vitality of the Cleveland metropolitan area and the entire northeast Ohio region. As such. the ClevelandCuyahoga County Port Authority has been working to diversify. upgrade its facilities. and increase the volume of cargo at the port. The Cleveland Harbor improvement project. approved In H.R. 3958. is an important and integral part of these efforts. This fact has also been recognized by the House Committee on Public Works. which Is considering the authorization needed for this activity as part of H.R. 3678. the Water Resources Conservation. Development. and Infrastructure Improvement and Rehabilitation Act of 1983. Congressional approval of both of these measures will enable the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with further study of the Improvement of the eastern end of the Cleveland Harbor. including an eventual deepening and expanding of its east and west entrances. These improvements are critically needed to permit the port to accommodate the new generation of bulk freighters. measuring 1.000 feet by 195 feet with carrying capacities of 60.000 tons. Mr. Chairman. the Cleveland Harbor improvement project Is a costeffective initiative which will reap) substantial economic benefits to Cleveland residents and the Nation. The additional study and design work on this project is expected to cost about $125.000 and be completed by the end of fiscal year 1984. clearing the way for construction the following year. While the total project cost is expected to be about $32 million. this amount will be more than offset by annual savings of more than several million dollars from reduced transportation costs. Mr. Chairman. Congresswoman MARY ROSE OAKCAR and I have worked diligently for several years to secure thle necessary congressional approval for these harbor improvements. We have worked with and consulted my good friend. Congressman Tom BEVILL. As always. he has given his thoughtful attention and consideration to this matter and I sincerely appreciate his efforts. Similarly. I want to express my deep appreciation to Congressman ROBERT RoE. chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources of the House Public Works Committee. for his diligent and painstaking consultation with both Representative MARY ROSE QARAR and myself on water resource project authorization Issues affecting the Cleveland community. In closing. I would like to reiterate that the Cleveland. Harbor improvement project will have a greatly positive impact on the Cleveland economy and result In a more efficient use of the Cleveland Port. The Federal Investment in and public benefit resulting from this project are amply documented. Thus. I encourage your support of this activity and urge the adoption of H.R. 3958. the Water Resources Development Act for fiscal year 1984.

980109956,Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Cleveland Port is a very important specialized port. serving as a major transportation link to primarily the steel Industry. Over 1.200 vessels and tankers from over 50 countries and 120 world ports arrive annually at the docks lining the lakes shore and the banks of the Cuyahoga River.

The Cleveland Harbor imnprovement project. Is an Important and Integral part of these efforts. Congressional approval of both of these measures will enable the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with further study of the improvement of the Eastern end of the Cleveland Harbor. including an eventual deepening and expanding of its east and west entrances. These Improvements are critically needed to permit the port to accommodate the new generation of bulk freighters. measuring 1.000 feet by 195 feet with carrying capacities of 60.000 tons. Mr. Charman. the Cleveland Harbor improvement project is a costeffective initiative which will reap substantial economic benefits to Cleveland residents and the Nation. The additional study and design work on this project Is expected to cost about $125.000 and be completed by the end of fiscal year 1984.. clearing the way for construction the following year. This amount will be more than offset by annual savings of more than several million dollars from reduced transportation costs. In closing. I would like to reiterate that the Cleveland Harbor improvement project will have a greatly positive impact on the Cleveland economy and result In a more efficient use of the Cleveland Port. The Federal Investment in and public benefit resulting from this project are amply documented. Thus. I encourage your support of this activity and urge the defeat of the Edgar amendment.
980201035,"Mr. Speaker. I am taking this opportunity to rise in strong support of the conference report for House Joint Resolution 492. providing supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1984. Three especially critical areas are addressed in this legislation: Youth summer employment. emergency food aid (Food for Peace) to 24 African countries. and food programs for women. infants. and children (WIC). Mr. Speaker. House Joint Resolution 492 would provide an additional $100 million for urgently needed jobs for disadvantaged youth this summer. With minority youth unemployment hovering at nearly 50 percent. the jobs financed through the summer youth employment program provide the first valuable work experience for many minority young people. These funds will help to insure that participating communities receive roughly 90 percent of the summer job funding that they received last year. Without the additional $100 million II 4780 restoring total funding for the summer youth employment program to last years level of $824 million. major urban cities will suffer a devastating reduction in Federal aid for summer Jobs for youth. According to data provided by the League of Cities. the National Association of countries. and the National Governors Association. of a total 60 areas surveyed. 43 reported funding reductions at or above 10 percent. My hometown of Cleveland. Ohio. reported a reduction in summer youth employment funding of 43 percent. The city of Chicago has been hit the hardest. and. according to the survey. was the victim of a 47percent reduction in funds. in addition to the loss of some 16.000 summer jobs. Other cities reporting funding reductions are: Dallas at 40 percent. Indianapolis at 30 percent. Minneapolis at 38 percent: and New York City at 20 percent. If the 43 percent reduction in Federal support to Cleveland is permitted to materalize the summer youth employment program will serve approximately 3.300 youth. 5.500 less than the total number served during the summer 1983. Moreover. in addition to normal work experience. su.ch exemplary activities as the aptitude comprehensive test/scholastic aptitude test (ACTSAT) and study skill workshops would no longer be offered to Cleveland area youngsters. Another critical area addressed by House Joint Resolution 492. Mr. Speaker. is the problem of famine on the continent of Africa. Thousands upon thousands of Africans In 24 countries are dying and facing starvation in what is being called the ""most widespread and devastating drought in the continents recent history."" There is no reason. politicial or technical. why people should be starving in Africa or anywhere in the world in 1984. Approximately 150 million are facing famine and death as a result of the drought that has gripped a large portion of the continent. Africa is facing the worst food shortage since the early part of the 1970s when at least 200.000 to 300.000 people starved to death. For a majority of the 24 droughtstricken African countries. 1984 marks the second year in a row that there has been insufficient rainfall to grow food. and so forth. U.N. officials estimate that in Ethiopia alone. 50 to 100 children are dying each day as a direct result of malnutrition or starvation. The drought of 1984 represents the first time in recent history that so many African nations have been stricken by drought and widespread famine simultaneously. Thus. it is clear that Congress must not delay another day in approving the additional $60.000 contained in House Joint Resolution 492 for food relief for Africa. These funds will be made available from the Commodity Credit Corporation inventory for sale on a competitive bid. basis or charter to those African nations requiring emergency food assistance. Funds would also be available to any country for use in assisting In emergency food assistance to Africa. as is authorized by section 101(b) of Public Law 98107. And finally. House Joint Resolution 492 would provide for an additional $66.000.000 for the feeding program for women. infants and children (WIC). Despite the fact that this Nations children are first already among Americans in poverty and budget sacrifice. the Reagan administration has failed to recommend adequate funding for this tremendously successful program. Congress must now take swift action to provide the necessary resources to prevent cutbacks in nutritional assistance for needy mothers and children. According to former Federal food stamp Administrator Robert Greenstein. inadequate appropriations for WIC mean the elimination of 500.000 to 1 million pregnant women. Infants. and children from this program this summer alone. Mr. Speaker. I can think of no other Federal programs for which there is a more urgent and pressing case for the provision of additional Federal resources. House Joint Resolution 492 has been languishing in Congress for over 2 months now. I urge the swift adoption of the conference report for House Joint Resolution 492 so that the lives and wellbeing of mothers. children. and youth in Africa and here at home may be protected.e a Mr. PATTERSON. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of increased military aid to El Salvador. on the condition that standards outlined by Congress are met. I want. to emphasize how far El Salvador has come and. at the same time. remind my colleagues of the need to continue with judicial. electoral. and other reforms now underway. I think El Salvador is on the way back from chaos and corruption. The recent election and the indications that Presidentelect Jose Napoleon Duarte Is going to be allowed to assume office in June. as scheduled. are signs that conditions have improved even since I traveled throughout El Salvador just 2112 months ago. It seems clear that these improvements have oLcurred. in part. because the U.S. Congress has made it clear that while we are willing to commit funds to help El Salvador fight communism. we are not willing to throw money down the drain. The Salvadorans have to continue to make reforms that strengthen their Governments legitimacy and undercut the guerrillas appeal or we are wasting money trying to help them. Recently. they have shown that they are beginning to take us seriously and that they are willing to try and we have shown in turn that we are willing to help promptly and generously. Now. just as some of the U.S.-inspired reforms are showing results. some of my colleagues have decided it is time to write the Salvadoran milltary a blank check. They say that to put any conditions at all on our aid is to compromise the sovereignty of the nation of El Salvador. That is one of the strangest things I have heard in a decade in the House of Representatives. If we wanted to tell the Salvadorans what to do with the tax money they collect from their citizens. that would compromise their sovereignty. All we want to do is to set some conditions on how they use the tax money we collect from our citizens. And I must say. it is hard for me to see what is wrong with that. The conditions that have been put on aidmainly concerning democratic processes and human rightsare not lofty ideals. but are essential components of a coordinated social. econom1c. and military assault against communism. We should not abandon those conditions now. when we are contemplating a very substantial increase in military aid. To give military aid now with no indication that civilian and military reforms are still important to us will hardly strenghten Mr. Duartes hand against the extremists he must tame within El Salvadors military. I have the highest regard for Mr. Duarte. as do nearly all of my colleagues. But I recognize that he cannot do the job alone and he will need to be able to turn to those in his country who oppose judicial and electoral reform. who oppose Increased attention to human rights. and who oppose the land reform program and say. ""To stop a Communist victory in our country we need to make reforms and to protect ourselves militarily. The United States will help us. but we cant do one without the other."" When Mr. Duarte can say that. he will have a powerful tool for achieving the cooperation of various factions with which he has to work.*"

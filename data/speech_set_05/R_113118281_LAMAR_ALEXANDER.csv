1130001957,"Mr. President. I wish to thank Senator LEVIN for his leadership. as well as Senator MCCAIN. Senators SCHUMER. CARDIN. PRYOR. and Senator Kylwho has now retired from the Senateand Senator BARRASSO. We are hopeful the leaders will be able to recommend to us a set of changes in our rules and procedures and practices that will help the Senate operate in a fairer and more efficient way. That is what all of us want. It is surprising how many of us want that. We all worked pretty hard to get here. We all understand we are political accidents. The Senator from Maine. the Senator from Arkansaswe all know that. We are very fortunate to be here. While we are here. we would like to contribute something. That gets down to a couple things. Lets make it easy for a committee bill to come to the floor. and lets make it easier for Senators from the various States and from various points of view to have their say. Allow them to offer their amendment and have it voted up or down and to have a final vote. That is all. I often use the analogy of the Grand Ole Opry. A person is lucky to be on the Grand Ole Opry. If you are there. you want to sing. Sometimes being in the Senate has been like being in the Grand Ole Opry and not being able to sing. We have all done the fingerpointing. The Democratsthe majoritysay: You Republicans are filibustering. You are blocking things and keeping things from happening. What we are saying is the majority leader has used the gag rule 69 times. Senator Daschle only used it once. What the eight of us found very quickly when we sat down in the first meeting a few weeks ago was that we were of the same mind. We honored this institution and we believe our country has serious problems. We want to get to those problems. and we want to serve our country well in the position we have. If we are from Michigan. we want to be able to offer the voices of Michigan on the floor of the Senate. If we are from Nashville or the mountains of Tennessee or Maine. we want to be able to do the same. We want our voices heardnot our voices but the voices of the people whom we represent. That is the importance of the discussion we are having today. My hope is the majority leader and the Republican leaderand I congratulate them for sort of sticking their necks out in their respective conferencesrecommend a way that we can do two things: make it easier for bills to come to the floor and make it easier for Senators to get their amendments in. I believe if that happens. this Senate will see a new day. On this side of the aisle. we believe we dont need rules changes. that we just need a change in behavior. On the other side of the aisle. there are those who say: Lets get rid of the filibuster. I think once we get back into what we call regular order. all that talk will go away. I think Senator MIKULSKI and Senator SHELBY are going to have 10 or 11 or 12 appropriations bills ready to come to the floor within a few weeks. and I think they are going to want them to be considered by this body. If they do. we will be busy for 8 or 10 weeks and we will have dozens of amendments. I heard the chairman of the Budget Committee say she intended to have a budget and. if she does. we will have dozens of amendments. Then the voices of the people of this country will be heard here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We will have votes. we will have amendments. and we will be doing our job. and all of this talk we are having right now will be pushed into the background. There is a reason for a Senate that is different than the House of Representatives. It goes all the way back to the founding of our country. It was noticed by the first observers of our country. Alexis de Tocqueville. in his fascinating view of America in ""Democracy in America"" which he wrote in the early part of the 19th century. said America faced two great challenges. One was Russia. The other one was the tyranny of the majority. This is a democracy. This is a majority rules country. But he saw in a great. big. complex country the danger of the tyranny of the majority. And this institution. the U.S. Senate. has from the beginning of the country protected the minority and protected the unpopular view. If a Senator didnt like the Vietnam war. he or she could stand up and say something here and maybe do something about it. Or if a Senator was on the other side. maybe he or she could do something about it. They could make people slow down and stop and think before the country rushes ahead. Senators of both parties eloquently. as Senator LEVIN has pointed out. have defended that right. We Republicans in the Bush administration were so upset about the Democrats blocking of judges that we said we might use the nuclear option. that we might turn this into a majority body. Now there are a number of Democrats who feel the same way here. I hope we put that away and realize that this is the body that stands up for minority views in this country and says. dont run over minorities. Stop and think. Stop and think before you do that. Then we forge a consensus. To conclude my remarksbecause I see the Senator from Arkansas. who has been an outstanding contributor to this effort. as he has been through his time in the SenateI came to the Senate as a young staff aide in 1967. That was a long time ago. I saw a little bit of how important it is to have a body that gains a consensus when we are talking about a big. difficult issue for the whole country. In 1967. the issue was civil rights. The Senator from Maine knows about those early days in the Senate. The Senator from Michigan does as well. There were a minority of Republicans at that time. Everett Dirksen was the Republican leader. But the civil rights bill of 1968 was written in the Republican leaders office. Why? Because at that time they had to get 67 votes to pass it. One might say. Well. that shows what is wrong with the Senate. because it slowed things down. But looking back over history. those last 8 or 10 years of civil rights laws. the Voting Rights Act. eventually all of the laws that changed our country and continue to change it. were big steps. And what happened in 1968 once the Senate gained a consensus on civil rights? Senator Russell. who led the opposition to the civil rights bill through his whole career. got on the airplane. went home to Georgia and said. It is the law of the land. Now we obey it. So the value of having a body in our government that respects the minority and forces a consensus is that once we reach that consensusonce we reach itwe then have a better chance of having the country behind what we do on the very controversial and difficult issues we face. So if this works out as I hope it does today. I pledge my part to work with the majority. as one Senator. to help make sure bills come to the floor. and to work with Republican Senators in the minority to help make sure they get their amendments. If we do. I think we will do our job better. we will gain more respect. the country will have a stronger government. and the rights of the minority will be protected. I thank Senator LEVIN for his leadership. as well as Senator PRYOR and the others with whom I have worked. I yield the floor."
1130016955,"Mr. President. I know Senator BARRASSO is coming. but until he does. I wish to make a few comments about the Marketplace Fairness Act. which is the legislation before us today. and especially. to begin with. Senator HEITKAMPS address. the new Senator from North Dakota. It is rare that a new Senator has a chance to come to the Senate and in her first few months find us debating a bill she brought when she was a State official in North Dakota 20 years ago. That shows why the Senate is a good place for people with a little bit of experience because she can bring to us exactly what we are talking about. Her story about the small business people who are making a few dollars and have a very small margin for profit and then who are discriminated against by outofState sellers who dont have to collect the tax that is already owed is a real story. and she made a remarkably good address and I compliment her for that and welcome her to the Senate. Sometimes we launch into these complicated debates without saying what we are talking about. Let me see if I can say in a few simple words exactly what we are talking about here. My wife gave me an ice cream freezer for my birthday last year. She got it from Williams- Sonoma. It is not one of those freezers you have to crank. as I did when I was a kid. and when you eat the ice cream it makes your head hurt because you would eat it too fast. This is a modern ice cream freezer. and you mix the stuff up and put it in. and after a while here comes the ice cream. But then I discovered that WilliamsSonoma also sells a mix you can order and that makes it even easier. So I ordered the mix. WilliamsSonoma has stores in Tennessee. but I ordered mine online. I dont do this very much so I am not the best online purchaser who is around. But I looked up the catalog number. punched a few buttons on my computer. and I ordered my ice cream ingredients. It asked for my name. address. and the information on my credit card. And with that information. two things happened: I ordered the ingredients and they arrived within a few days. But Williams- Sonoma. through the Internet. determined from my ZIP Code what the sales tax is in Tennessee and in my home county and will remit it electronically to the State of Tennessee. That is what we are talking about. If I go to the WilliamsSonoma store in Nashville and I buy the ice cream freezer or the ingredients. they add our 10percent sales tax to it. If I order it online from Williams- Sonoma. they add the 10 percent. too. because I put my ZIP Code in. The way software is today. it is very simple to find out what the tax is in any jurisdiction. It is as easy as finding out the weather. If I want to know the weather in Maryville. TN. I put weather 37205. That is my ZIP Code. I find out the weather. WilliamsSonoma can find out the tax I owe on the ice cream ingredients that way. So the WilliamsSonoma store in Nashville collects the tax. and they have to do it by law. That is part of their business responsibility in the State of Tennessee. The WilliamsSonoma store online collects the tax because they have stores in Tennessee. But lots of other outofState sellers do not collect the tax that is already owed. It is owed. It is said there is a new tax here. I dont know where everybody got that. They must not have read the bill carefully. The U.S. Congress cant change the sales tax in Tennessee. We cant impose it. we cant lower it. we cant raise it. That is under the responsibility of the sovereign State of Tennessee. This bill has nothing to do with the Federal Tax Code. Caterpillars have as much to do with the Federal Tax Code as this bill does. So it has nothing to do with taxes. This bill has to do with two words. and two words alone: States rights. Or you could substitute those two words with Tenth Amendment. Do we believe here in the Senate that the Governor of Tennessee or Massachusetts or Kentucky or Wyoming or anywhere else has to come here and play ""mother. may I"" to ask permission to decide what the State tax policy ought to be in Tennessee? Tennessee imposes its own State sales tax. That is its decision. We do not have a State income tax. That is Tennessees decision. Some States do. States have the right to be right. States have the right to be wrong. That came with our constitutional framework. We ignore it all the time. A lot of Senators who fly to Washington somehow get the ideaif they can get through the delay on the tarmac everybody else is experiencing right nowthat this 1hour flight makes them smarter because they flew up here. No. it doesnt make us smarter. In fact. we ought to leave to States the responsibilities that States are supposed to havewhether it is in education or in health care or anything else. but certainly in matters of State tax policy. We shouldnt be trying to tell Tennessee or Massachusetts or anybody else what their taxes ought to be. What we are doing with this bill is we are doing what the Supreme Court said we are the best persons to do. That is what Senator HEITKAMP said a little while ago. We are the ones to write the rules to say: States. of course. may decide whether they want to collect the State sales tax and use tax from all the people who owe it or some of the people who owe it. That is what the issue is. Lets say we pass the Marketplace Fairness Act. It says that Tennessee can make its own decision about how it collects its sales tax and its use tax. Tennessee could decide it wants to discriminate against the Nashville Boot Company that sells boots out the front door. collects the sales tax. and sends it to the State. Lets discriminate against the Nashville Boot Company and tell the outofState seller of boots. You dont have to do that. Or. the State may decideas I am sure it will. because the Governor. the Lieutenant Governor. and the legislators have told me they will. They may decide: We dont pick and choose between winners and losers. we dont pick and choose between taxpayers. we dont pick and choose between businesses. We want a level playing field. So we are going to say to the outofState sellercatalog. online. or whatever it iswelcome. You can sell in Tennessee if you play by the same rules that people who live in Tennessee do. That is all you have to do. So the States are going to require. as it does. the Nashville Boot Company. the WilliamsSonoma store. the service station. the drugstore. to collect the sales tax and send it in to the States. and it is going to require the outofState seller to do the same thing. That is all we are talking about. If the outofState seller doesnt want to do it. it doesnt have to. Nobody is requiring people to sell their stuff in Tennessee. It is a free country. It is a big country. It is a big market. We produce 25 percent of all the money in the world. If you dont like Tennessees rules. as long as they fit the constitutional framework of not imposing a burden on interstate commerce. you dont have to sell in Tennessee. We hope you will. And if it is as easy for you to collect the tax as it is to find out the weather in your hometown. we dont know why you wouldnt. We dont know why you would even expect that you would be treated better than somebody who lives in Tennessee and goes to work every day in Tennessee and pays taxes in Tennessee and collects taxes in Tennessee. We will treat you just as well as we do the local folks. but we are not going to treat you any better and put you at an advantage with our hometown businesses. That is what this is about. and that is all it is about. Lets make clear what this is not. It is not a tax. It is about taxes already owed. It is not a Federal tax. It is State taxes already owed. Sales taxes and use taxes. that is all we are talking about. Are we telling any State they must do this or must do that? No. We are saying to States that we are simply affirming the spirit of the Tenth Amendment. which says: You have the right to decide for yourself. Mr. Governor. Ms. Legislator. what your State tax structure ought to be. It is up to you. If you want to have just some people pay the sales taxes and use taxes that are owed and other people to not pay them. that is up to you too. That is your business. But this is a States rights Tenth Amendment decision that leaves to the States this ability. I wanted to talk mostly about what we are talking about: We are talking about what happens when you buy something online. from a catalog. and the local store. and making sure that States are able. if they wish. to treat all businesses in the same way. That is why so many conservative leaders. as they have understood this bill. have come to support it. This is a rarity in the Senate. This is an 11page bill. Some people say it has been rushed. I wish to respectfully disagree with that. This legislation was introduced beginning in 2001. It was introduced in almost exactly the same form in 2011. It had a full hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee in 2011 in almost the same form of the 11page bill that is before us today. Exactly this bill was filed on February 14. 2013. so everyone has had plenty of time to read it since February 14. This is a bill that has been here for a long time. and the reason it is before us and hasnt come through the Finance Committee is because the Finance Committee simply wouldnt hear it. act on it. and report it. We have a chance to amend it. The majority leader has said there will be amendments. It is my hope that Senators will come to the floor with their amendments as early as this afternoon. I hope Senators would want to keep amendments aimed at the subject of the debate. the marketplace fairness debate. There are many issues that have been raised. Lets bring them up. lets debate them. and lets vote on them. That is what we do when we are acting properly in the Senate. I mentioned some of the conservative leaders who have talked about this issue. William F. Buckley. before he died. talked about the unfairness of treating instate sellers one way and outofState sellers another way. Another leading advocate for the idea of marketplace fairness is Al Cardenas. who is chairman of the American Conservative Union. He has written eloquently about it. Former Governor Jeb Bush. former Governor Mitch Daniels. Governor Mike Pence. the Congressman from Indianathese are leading conservatives on the Republican side. They have all said if Congress does not act. it freezes into place a system that picks and chooses among winners and losers. that treats one taxpayer one way and one business another way. That is not a good principle. That is not a good conservative principle at all. That is why so many of the Republican Governors. the Republican leadersArt Laffer. President Reagans favorite economist and distinguished writer. wrote in the Wall Street Journal last week that it would actually help economic growth if States were permitted to collect taxes from all of the people who owe it rather than some of the people who owe it. Mr. Laffer said. and I am paraphrasing. that the best tax policy is one that. when there has to be a tax. taxes the largest number of people at the lowest possible rate. Governor Haslam of Tennessee. Governor Otter of Idaho. many of the Governors have said if we have the opportunity to collect the taxes from everybody who already owes them. we have in mind a tax rate we would like to lower. We would like to have a lower sales tax rate in Tennessee. We dont like a 10percent tax rate. One reason we have it is because some people do not pay it even though they owe it. The reason they do not pay it is because outofState sellerscatalog. onlinemany of them do not collect it as others will do. I think that is a summary of the legislation before us. It is about States rights. It is an 11page bill. It has been before the Senate for months. The idea has been before the Senate for years. It does not seek to tell any State to do anything. New Hampshire does not have a sales tax. After this law is passed New Hampshire citizens will not have to pay a sales tax. If a New Hampshire company or Michigan company sells in Tennessee they will have to do what Tennessee companies do. or anybody else who sells in Tennessee will have to collect the tax and send it to the State governmentor not sell. But unlike 20 years ago. that is pretty easy today. As I have said. it is as easy as putting in a ZIP code and finding out the weather. One can compute the tax the same way I found out what my ice cream ingredients from WilliamsSonoma cost and what the tax was. and in the same way I paid that tax. I look forward to the debate. I hope we can enact this bill. We have had 2 good votes: one at 74 votes and one at 75 votes. A majority of Democrats supported each vote. A majority of Republicans supported each vote. There is substantial support in the House of Representatives. This is an important States rights piece of legislation. It is part of our job to simplify things and not to require States to play ""Mother may I?"" with Congress about what their tax structure ought to be."
1130017694,To summarize some of these steps. this began in the 107th Congress in 2001. Now Senator ENZI started even before that. I think. with Senator Dorgan. They introduced the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act in 2000 and 2001. Then in 2003. the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Act was introduced by Senator ENZI. That is 10 years ago. Then again in 2005 and 2006 Senator ENZI and Senator Dorgan. Then again in 2007 and 2008. Senator ENZI. In the 111th Congress no bill was introduced. But now we are getting to a little more recent history. Last Congress. 2011 and 2012. Senator DURBIN introduced the Main Street Fairness Act. Senator ENZI joined him in that. It was referred to the Senate Finance Committee. So for all of that time. the Finance Committee has had an opportunity to work on this legislation in the way they thought it should be. There were hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee in August of 2012 on essentially the same 11page bill that has been introduced here today and that we are acting on. There was a partial hearing in the Senate Finance Committee during that year. But that was all. Then. in this year. in February. on Valentines Day. Senator ENZI introduced the Marketplace Fairness Act we are debating here. this 11page bill. There was a letter from 16 Senators. Republicans and Democrats. asking the Finance Committee to hold a hearing and to deal with it. But it has not. I respect the decision of the chairman to be opposed to the bill and not to hold a hearing and not to report the bill to the floor. But if he does that. then I would suggest he should respect the right of the majority leader to bring the bill to the floor and allow the Senate to debate it. As far as the regular order goes. a week should be long enough to consider this bill. which has been in one form or another around since 2001. We could have begun debating amendments on Monday. That is when the bill came to the floor. But the opponents filibustered it. This was not a Republican or a Democratic filibuster. it was both sides. from opponents. And what that deprived us of was an opportunity to vote and debate amendments on Monday and Tuesday. Then we had another vote. So we have now had three votes. one during the budget session. one on cloture on the motion to proceed. and then one on the motion to proceed itself. We have gotten 74. 75 votes each time. It is a majority of the Democratic Senators. it is a majority of the Republican Senators. This does not happen all the time. that we have such strong majorities on each side of the aisle. saying in three successive votes of 74 and 75 votes: We favor an important piece of legislation. I would hope the better course would be to come to some agreement that we can take the amendments we have here from Democrats and from Republicans. bring them up. table them. vote on them. debate them. and act on this and bring this to a conclusion this week. Then there is substantial support in the House of Representatives for this. The bill could then go to the House. The House could do whatever the House wishes. There could be a conference and we could get a result. Every attempt has been made by the sponsors of this legislation since 2001 to bring this through the regular order. which means take it through the committee. The opponents of the idea have chosen first in the Finance Committee to not allow there to be a markup of the bill. and then on the floor to not allow us to debate amendments. For example. some people say this legislation taxes the Internet. Of course. that is 100 percent wrong. because there is a Federal law banning State taxation of the Internet. Senator PRYOR of Arkansas sought to extend that ban for 10 more years today. The opponents of the bill objected even to a vote on taxing the Internet. This is very disappointing. That is the information about the timeline I wanted to put in. Here is some more information that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at this point.
1130018235,Mr. President. I thank the Senator for her knowledge and her contribution to the debate. Of course. what she is emphasizing is that if we do act. we simplify things for the small businessperson. For one thing. we exempt anyone whose revenues are less than $1 million. That. by some economists studies. is 99 percent of all Internet sellers. If we dont act and a case is won in the Supreme Court today. that is different than 20 years ago. There is no $1 million exemptionthere is no $1 million exemptionand there is exposure to 9.600 tax districts if they win that case. So the thing to think about is if we do our job. and the Supreme Court said 20 years ago we are the ones to do itand 74 or 75 of us 3 times now have indicated we think we should through this 12page bill. we will provide an exemption for virtually all Internet sellers. we will create rules that simplify. and we will give States the opportunity to do what States should have the opportunity to do. My heavens. I hear some people sayand I have said this on the floorWashington didnt trust the States to make these decisions about tax matters. Nobody in Tennessee trusts Washington to make decisions about tax matters. So what this bill does is say to the State of Tennessee or Delaware. it is your business. you decide it. If what you want to do is collect tax from some of the people who owe it and not all of the people who owe itStates have the right to be right. States have the right to be wrong. That is what the 10th Amendment is about. In some States. they will use the money to pay teachers more for teaching well. In the State of Ohio they have already decided if this passes. they are going to lower the income tax. The Governor of Idaho said he already has his eye on a tax he would like to lower. If we can collect taxes from everybody who already owes themand that is the important point to make. We are not talking about new taxes. we are talking about taxes people arent paying that they owe. So why should I have to pay my tax. and if the Senator from Delaware is in the same similar situation. why should he not have to pay? So in each State. the same people ought to have to pay. Art Laffer. the distinguished economist who wrote a good column in the Wall Street Journal endorsing this idea of marketplace fairness. said the best tax. if there has to be a tax. is one that affects the largest number of people at the lowest possible rate. If we have a 10percent sales tax in Tennessee and 25 percent of the people who buy things are not paying a tax they owe. they ought to be paying it. They ought to be paying it. If they all pay it. we can lower the rate for everybody. That is whatwe are not deciding that here. we are just deciding the States could have the right to decide. But the important point of the Senator from North Dakota is that if we act. we are protecting the small seller by creating the $1 million exemption. We are protecting the small seller or any remote seller by saying you have a limited liability. a limited number of audits. a limited number of States to do it in. and if we dont act and the Supreme Court hears this case. Katy bar the door. and outofState sellers all over the world will be coming to the Congress and saying: Why didnt you do your job? So there is a good reason why we have a majority of Democrats who have voted three times to express their support for this bill and a majority of Republicans who have done the same. There is a good reason why leading observers across the country. from the chairman of the American Conservative Union and others who dont like to see States picking and choosing between winners and losersthere is a good reason all of those people support this. And there is a good reason it is an 11page bill. It is a simple idea. We have sovereign States. States make their own tax laws. Unless States. by their tax laws. create an unconstitutional burden on an outofState seller. it is no business of ours. We should create the environment the court says to give them the freedom to make those decisions for themselves. Some may do it one way. some may do it another. but States have the right to be right. States have the right to be wrong. and we have the responsibility to recognize the constitutional framework of our country which was created by sovereign States. Thank you. Mr. President.
1130024808,"Madam President. being a majority leader is not an easy job whether you are a Republican or a Democrat. Some good things have been happening in the Senate recently. and I think we should credit both the majority leader and the Republican leader with helping to make that happen. Over the last few weeks we have seen the water resources bill come to the floor. The majority leader allowed Senator BOXER and Senator VITTER to manage the amendment process. to handle the necessary arguments that always occur about what they will be. They came to a conclusion and passed a bill. The bill went through committee. went through the floor. It is a very important bill because it deals with locks. dams. and ports in the United States. We want to make sure that as the Panama Canal is widened and deepened. that ports in the United States are deep enough to receive the bigger ships and that the locks and the dams are in good enough shape so that commerce can move through the company and the jobs can be created. That is an important piece of legislation. And now we are on the farm bill and we see the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Michigan managing a bill. There is plenty of opportunity for amendments. as far as I have been able to tell. and that has been very helpful. At the same time. we have coming out of the Judiciary Committee. after several days of intense work. a bill on immigration. Probably the four most important words that can be said about the immigration debate is that we are all Americans. and Americans know we must have a legal immigration system if we want to be able to say we are all Americans. And we want one. We dont have an enforceable legal system today. All of us know that. None of us like the status quo. I dont think. and all of us know the President and the Congress are the only ones who can fix it. This is not something we can dump on the mayors or the State legislatures. Many of us havent formed a final opinion about this legislation that is coming forward. but I. for one. respect the fact that it has moved. that it has four principal Republican sponsors and four principal Democratic sponsors. It has moved through the committee. voices have been heard. it is coming to the floor. and. again. the majority leader has indicated. and the Republican leader has agreed. there will be a full and open debate so the American people can see it and watch us come to a result. All those are good things. In addition. so that we might do that. there are a number of nominations about which we are likely to disagree. They will come after that so as not to interfere with the immigration debate. That brings me to my final point. I would note the fact that with occasional interruptions for debate over whether we are going to go to a budget. which I hope gets resolved. we are on a pretty good path right now. I hope the majority and the minority leaders can see that. We are moving this afternoon to a vote on a Federal appellate judge for the DC Circuit. A major objective of the Democratic side has been to get another judge on that circuit. and the President has nominated a person. Mr. Srinivasan. who. by every account. is an exceptional attorney. He came out of the committee with an 18to0 vote and has widespread respect and support. The only glitch in the process is the majority leader believed it was necessary to file a cloture motion this week. even though the Republican leader had agreed we would have an upordown vote on the Tuesday we get back. and every indication is that almost everyone would vote for that judge. That has now been resolved. and we are going to vote this afternoon at 2 p.m. I know better than to predict how the Senate will vote. but I will vote for Mr. Srinivasan. and I suspect he will be easily confirmed. In all of this the majority leader has believed it was necessary to suggest that somehow there is a problem with the Presidents nominations being considered by the Senate. so I think it is important that someone other than the Republican leaderbecause it is his job. really. to defend our sidelay out the facts. and I hope I can do that with some credibility because I worked with my Democratic colleagues at the beginning of the last Congress and at the beginning of this Congress to make it easier for this President and future Presidents to have their nominations considered. We have changed the rules to make it easier. Just a few months ago. in a long discussion that involved Senators on both sides in a debate on the floor. we made a number of changes to make it easier for a President to have his nominations considered. And 2 years ago we adopted the expedited nominations. where nominations simply come to the desk. If no single Senator wants it sent to committee. it just sits there until all the paper is in. then the majority leader will just move it on. Within the next few days there will be a number of those that come out of the Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee. So that speeds things up. We removed from the list of nominations about 160 lowlevel executive nominations. They are not subject anymore to Senate advise and consent. The President may just go ahead and appoint those persons. We have gotten rid of the secret hold. which was used for a long time to hold up nominees. and even to block them. because no one knew who was doing that. Earlier this year we changed the rules so that when a district judge comes up. there cant be a long debate after the district judge comes to the floor. As a result. things are moving along very well. So I would like to say there is not a problem with the Presidents nominations being considered in a timely fashion by the Senate. There is no problem. There is. however. the responsibility for advice and consent. Most of our Founders did not want a king. They created a Congress and they said: Here is an advice and consent. So we now have about 1.000 people the President will nominate whom we are supposed to consider. and we should do that well. That is our job to do. and it is our check on a runaway Executive. When I first came here. Senator Byrd made wonderful speeches about that. I remember the speeches Senator Kennedy gave from the back row. with that big booming voice of his. about President George W. Bushs recess appointments and how offended he was by those because they offended the Constitution. Senator Byrd. as I mentioned. was very eloquent. going all the way back to President Reagans days. So we have always jealously defended the peoples right to have an elected group of representatives to check the Executive. and we need to use that in a responsible way. Therefore. it is important to have an accurate report on just how well President Obama is being treated by the Senate in terms of his nominations. I have just noted that we have changed the rules to make it easier. I did not even say we have even made it easier for the nominees. we set up a working process to make it easier. I like to call it a response to the ""innocent until nominated"" syndrome. The President picks some wellrespecting person from the Midwest and sends his or her nomination to the Senate. and all of a sudden it is as if they were a criminal of some kind. That is because there were so many conflicting forms to fill out it was easy to make a mistake and look as though you were misleading the Senate. We have tried to simplify that. and this President is the first beneficiary of that change. So this President is the first beneficiary of consecutive Congresses that have changed the rules to reduce the number of potential nominees subjected to advice and consent. We have expedited a number of others. and we have made it easiereasier and quickerfor the President to have his nominations considered. This President is the first to benefit from that. So what are the results? The majority leader suggested there was delay and obstruction. Those words just come out automatically sometimes when people wake up in the morning on that side of the aisle. But lets look at the facts. I asked the Congressional Research Service to take a look at the Washington Post article written earlier this yearnow. these are not Republican people I am asking. this is the Congressional Research Serviceabout how President Obama is being treated in terms of his Senate nominees. According to the Congressional Research Service. as of May 16. 2013that is last weekPresident Obamas Cabinet nominees were still. on average. moving from announcement to confirmation faster than those of President George W. Bush or President Clinton. President Obamas nominees were moving from announcement to confirmation. at that time last week. in 50.5 days. George W. Bush averaged 52 days. and President Clinton averaged 55 days. So let me say that again: President Obamas Cabinet nominees are moving ahead in the Senate more rapidly than those of his two predecessors: one of them President George W. Bush and one of them President Clinton. So there is no delay there that is unusual. It is not unprecedented. Madam President. for some secondterm nominations to take much longer to move from announcement to confirmation than the average. President Clintons nominee for Secretary of Labor. Alexis Herman. took 135 days. President George W. Bushs nominee for Attorney General. Alberto Gonzalez. took 85 days. I remember the case of one especially distinguished nominee for Secretary of Education by President George H.W. Bush. a former Governor of Tennessee whose name was Alexander. His nomination took 88 days from announcement to confirmation. and President Reagans nominee for Attorney General. Ed Meese. took nearly 1 year. Now that is an unusual case. but it is not so unusual for secondterm nominees to take a little whilefor the Senate to perform advice and consent. And as the Congressional Research Service and the Washington Post have reported in their own analysis. President Obamas Cabinet nominees are being better treated than either President Bushs or President Clintons in terms of the time it takes to confirm them from announcement to confirmation. Now. one last thing. What about judges? Sometimes I have heard Senators on that side and Senators on this side get up and give conflicting information about whether judges are being considered rapidly. Here is what the data says about the judicial nomination process. If Mr. Srinivasan is confirmed today. as I expect he will be. President Obama will have had 20 judges confirmed at this point in his second term. including 6 circuit judges and 14 district court judges. At this point in his second term. President George W. Bush had 4. So that is 20 for President Obama. 4 for President George W. Bush. No unusual delay there. Apparently. President Obamas nominations are being considered more rapidly than those of President Bush. To be specific. lets go to the district court nominations. We know. with all the talk of a filibuster. in the history of the Senate there has never been a nominee for a Federal district court judge who has ever been denied his seat by a filibuster after that nomination came to the floor. So that needs to be said. too. But right now there are five pending district judge nominations that have been reported from committee that havent been confirmed. There have been 33 nominations this year. Fourteen are already confirmed. five are reported from committee. as I said. and await floor action. They were reported in May and April and three of them in March. So there is no big backlog. There are five. They were reported in the last few weeks. So no excessive delay there. Finally. on circuit court nominations. I mentioned we are likely to confirm one of the three that are today pending. Mr. Srinivasan. Twelve nominations of Federal circuit court judges have been received this year. Six will have been confirmed after this afternoon. That leaves twotwocircuit court judges who have been nominated by the President and await floor action. They were reported by the committee in April and February. So I cant find any evidence of any delay on Cabinet nominations. In fact. President Obama is being treated better than his predecessors. I dont see any evidence of any delay on judicial nominations. After the vote on Mr. Srinivasan. President Obama will have 20 confirmed in his second term. President Bush had 4. And there are only five pending district court nominations. all reported within the last few weeks. There are only three circuit nominations. one of which is likely to be confirmed this afternoon. On that one. the majority leader indicated Mr. Srinivasan. who has such widespread support on both sides of the aisle. had been waiting forever. Well. he has been waiting a while. President Obama nominated him on June 11. 2012. But why did he wait? Madam President. he had no hearing. Who is in charge of setting hearings? The Democratic majority is in charge of setting hearings. The Republicans cant call a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. So their nominee. Mr. Srinivasan. sat there all of last year. after June 11. without a hearing. There may have been delay. but that was a selfinflicted delay. What about this year for Mr. Srinivasan? Here is the timeline. He was nominated again on January 4 by the President. His hearing was April 10. I dont know why they had to go from January to April to have a hearing. but. again. that is solely within the control of the Democratic majority. He returned his questionswhich we all have to do if we are nominated for an executive positionon May 6. That is this month. The committee considered his nomination May 16. which is just last week. They approved it 18 to 0. That is all Democrats and all Republicans voting yes. He came to the calendar of the Senate on May 20. That was on Monday."
1130030535,I agree with the Republican leader. Of course. the distinguished majority leader agrees with the Senator as well. He said in his book in 2007I read it. but I will read it againwhen talking about the Republican efforts several years ago. Republicans were so upset with actual obstructionism. as opposed to made up obstructionism. which is what we see here. They were so upset that this is what Senator REID said: If the majority leader pursues a rules change that would kill the filibuster for judicial nominations. And once you open that Pandoras box. it was just a matter of time before a Senate leader who couldnt get his way on something moved to eliminate the filibuster from regular business as well. and that. simply put. would be the end of the Senate. What that means is the Senate would be similar to the House. A freight train could run through it. Many Senators have not visited the House Rules Committee. I have. It is an interesting place. The Republicans can run the House by a single vote. But if one goes up to the Rules Committeeand I am sure the distinguished Republican leader has been therethere are thirteen chairs. thirteen members. How many Democrats do you suppose have those chairs? Four. How many Republicans have those chairs? Nine. It is 2 to 1 plus 1 majority in the House Rules Committee. In the House of Representatives. whatever the majority wants to do it can do. If we have a body with 51 votes to make all the decisions. and if I and others are deeply concerned about the nuclear waste sitting around in some of these 100 reactorswe have several of us on both sides of the aisle who were working on legislation like thatand we want it put in a repository. legally. where it is supposed to be. we have 51 votes. if they all vote the way they voted before. to order the government to open Yucca Mountain and put the nuclear waste there. This is what we can do with 51 votes. The way our government is designed. the House can order that. which they have. The Senate hasnt because the majority leader has been able to make this body stop and think about whether it wanted to do this. I may not like that result. but I prefer that process for the good of the country to give us the time to work things out. I would ask the Republican leader. hasnt it always been the responsibility. maybe the chief responsibility. of the Republican leader and the Democratic leader to preserve this institution? Newer Senators may not know as much about it. may not have as long a view as they have. Over the time the minority leader has been here. hasnt that beenI would ask through the Chair to the Republican leader. hasnt that been the responsibility of the leaders of the Senate?
1130050397,Mr. President. I appreciate being part of the colloquy with the Senator from Texas. and I was listening to his comments. I remember being asked by Senator MCCONNELL and the House Speaker JOHN BOEHNER to speak on behalf of Republicans at the Presidents health care summit 3 years ago about the new health care law. I was the first speaker there and since that time have done my best to try to void its passage and then to repeal and replace it. But Im not in the shut down the government crowd. Im in the letstakeoverthegovernment crowd and elect a number of more Republicans and even a Republican President who agrees with us and who wants a different kind of health care law. one that introduces choice and competition and that actually reduces health care costs for most Americans. What bothers me so much about this impasse today is the effect it might have on our military men and women around the world. Im trying to imagine what it must be like for someone fighting in Afghanistan whose check might be late. whose spouse is at Fort Campbell. and whose mortgage is due today or tomorrow or the next day. or what if the Department of Defense school closes there and that spouse has a job and no childcare? These are very practical problems we need to be thinking about. We need not be thinking about shutting down the government. We need to be thinking about a way to fund the government and change the health care law at the same time. Now. the House of Representatives has tried once and now is trying it again to make a reasonable offer. These discussions are all about compromise. about taking suggestions that come from one body to the other body and taking what you can. So if they have come back and said: Well. the United States Senate had 79 Senators. including many Democrats. who voted to repeal the medical device tax. And they said: Lets delay the individual mandate for a year. Im surprised the President himself has not done that. The President himself has delayed seven provisions. major provisions in the health care law. including the employer mandate. The regulations arent ready. The program is supposed to start tomorrow. It would seem to me it would actually be to the Presidents benefit. as well as the countrys benefit. to say instead of just delaying parts and exempting these people. lets get it right. Lets delay it for 1 year. That is what the House of Representatives. the Republican House. has said to the Senate. They have said lets repeal the medical device tax. a particularly onerous 2.3% tax on top of revenues that increases the cost of medical devices for millions of Americans. We all agree we ought to get rid of it79 of us do anyway. including about as many Democrats as Republicans. And the President himself has acknowledged this law isnt ready. The chairman of the Democratic Committee that wrote it says it is a coming train wreck. So it seems to me this is a reasonable suggestion from the House of Representatives to say lets work on getting rid of ObamaCare. that is what we would like to do. or changing it. that is what they would like to do to make it work. but lets fund the government. Lets not run the risk that one single soldier fighting in Afghanistan has a paycheck that is one day late because his spouse is home in Fort Campbell and the mortgage cant be paid or the Department of Defense School is closed and there is no childcare for the spouse who has a job while her husband or his wife is fighting overseas. Now. thats something we should not allow to happen. whether its Republicans or Democrats. It may be that the majority leader agrees with that and he has brought that up and we have brought that up. but we should do more than bring up political points. People expect us to act like adults. work together. come to a result. so we can change the health care law and we can keep the government going. Ive said for three years that instead of the historic mistake we passed which expanded health care delivery systems that already cost too much. we should go step by step to have a health care law that actually reduces health care costs: Make Medicare solvent instead of taking onehalf trillion dollars out of it for other programs. Give Medicaid more flexibility so Governors can serve more people. Repeal the medical device tax. Make it easier for employers who want to help employees have a healthier lifestyle so they can have cheaper insurance. Allow people to buy insurance across state lines. Allow small businesses to pool their resources and offer insurance. I have listed a half dozen already. steps we could agree on that would reduce health care costs in the country. Im not in the shut down the government crowd. and neither are most everybody I know around here. We are in the takeoverthegovernment crowd. and lets elect enough Republicans and a Republican President to change the health care law. But in the meantime. we should make absolutely sure that men and women. whether on Active Duty or in the National Guard. not on Active Duty at this time. we should make sure they are paid on the day they are supposed to be paid and their spouses are not waiting for the check. I thank the Senator from Texas for engaging in this colloquy. and I wish to join him in this effort.
1130089723,"Mr. President. this colloquy is for the purpose of marking an important day in the Senate because it was on this day 1 year ago that the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Marketplace Fairness Act. We did this by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. Sixtynine Senators. including about half of our Republican caucus. 21 Republicans. supported an 11page billa rarity in this bodythat is about just two words. and the words are ""States rights."" The Marketplace Fairness Act. simply described. gives States the right to decide for themselves whether to collect or not collect State sales taxes that are already owed. This ability to collect taxes that are already owed would give States the option to reduce existing taxes or to avoid a new tax or to pay for services without raising taxes. The Marketplace Fairness Act closes a tax loophole that prefers some businesses over other businesses and some taxpayers over other taxpayers. OutofState businesses are being subsidized because they dont have to collect sales taxestaxes that are owedand local businesses do. As a result. some taxpayers are being subsidized because some pay sales taxes and others do not even though they may owe the taxes. That is not right. and it is not fair. This legislation. which passed the Senate 1 year ago. gives States the option to decide whether to change that. One of the best ways to lower State taxes is for the Federal Government to allow States to collect State sales taxes from everyone who owes the tax and not just from some of the people who owe the tax. We have an honor roll of conservatives who do not think States ought to have to play ""Mother May I?"" with the Federal Government on this question. For example. Al Cardenas. chairman of the American Conservative Union. Art Laffer. President Reagans favorite economist. Charles Krauthammer. Representative PAUL RYAN. Governor Mike Pence. a former Member of the House of Representatives. Governor Chris Christie. former Governor Jeb Bush. former Governor Mitch Daniels. and the late William F. Buckley. not to mention Governor Bill Haslam of the State of Tennessee. agree that recognizing the power of State legislators to make these decisions for themselves is consistent with the 10th amendment and our constitutional framework. In our State of Tennessee. the Marketplace Fairness Act is an insurance policy against a State income tax. We dont have a State income tax and we dont want a State income tax. The House of Representatives has not yet acted on this bill. The bill that was passed a year ago today by the Senate was an overwhelming bipartisan vote. We are hopeful that the House will soon either enact our bill. which we have sent to them. or send us their version of the bill so we can confer and send a result to the President of the United States. State and local governments have been waiting on Congress to solve this problem for more than 20 yearssince 1992 when the Supreme Court said Congress has the ultimate power to resolve the issue. Now is the time to act on this legislation. We are ready to work with the House to enact that legislation this year. In conclusion. I will read the comments of Al Cardenas. chairman of the American Conservative Union and former chairman of the Florida Republican Party. When talking about the Marketplace Fairness Act. Mr. Cardenas said. When it comes to state sales tax. it is time to address the area where federally mandated prejudice is most egregious the policy towards Internet sales. the decadesold inequity between online and inperson sales as outdated and unfair. Again. that was Al Cardenas. chairman of the American Conservative Union. speaking in support of the Marketplace Fairness Act. I am pleased that of the four Senators who will be on the floor during this colloquy. two are already here. I see the Senator from North Dakota. and I see the Senator from Wyoming. If it is all right with the Senator from Wyoming. I will defer to the Senator from North Dakota. While the Senator may be a little modest about thisI hope she is notshe actually started it all. She has a better view of the Marketplace Fairness Act than just about anyone because of her service in the State government of North Dakota. She has an ability to explain in plain and simple language why the fair and right thing to do is to recognize the rights of States to make these decisions for themselves. Her ability to do that has been a crucial part of our debate and is one of the reasons why we had such overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate."
1130098714,Mr. President. I heard the majority leaders comments about the importance of moving on to the veterans bill. so I have a suggestion: Why dont we send this political stunt on student loans to the Senate education committee. where the Senator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. and I are busy working in a bipartisan way to reauthorize higher education. and lets move on to the veterans bill immediately. Why should the Senate take a week on a political stunt that everybody here knows wont pass when veterans are standing in line at clinics. waiting for us to act on a bipartisan solution to their problems? It actually goes further in giving veterans more choices in health care than anything Congress has ever done. It actually begins to give veterans more choice in health care in the same way Congress gave them choices in higher education with the passage of the GI bill for veterans in 1944. Back then. Congress said to the veterans: Here is the money. Go choose your college. Moving to and passing the veterans bill. Congress would be saying: If you have to stand in line too long or if you live too far away from a veterans facility. here is the moneygo choose your medical care. That is a very important step for millions of veterans. It deals directly with the problems all Senators on both sides of the aisle are chagrined aboutveterans standing in line waiting for health care. So I have one question: Why should the Senate spend a week on a political stunt? Why should we go all the way to next Monday before disposing of it? Lets dispose of it today. Lets send it to the committee that is already considering these issues. and lets move on to the veterans bill before noon. We could do that. and the veterans and the people of this country would respect us for it. I thought we had stopped the political stunts on student loans last year when the President. to his credit. worked with the Republican House and a bipartisan group in the Senate. and came to a resulta big result. It affects $100 billion of loans every year. Half the students in America have a grant or loan to help pay for college. Congress stopped this type of political stunt last year. Instead of every election year where someone comes forward offering some preposterous proposal about what we can do in the hope that students might vote for themCongress stopped that by saying: Lets put a marketbased pricing system on new student loans. The effect of that was to stop semiannual political stunts. while lowering the interest rate on loans for undergraduates nearly in half. Undergraduate students are 85 percent of the students receiving federal loans. So a 19yearold student can get a loan to go to college at 3.86 percent without any credit rating and in some cases can get a grant of up to $5.645 to go to college. Congress did that last year. This year the Senate education committee has held 10 bipartisan hearings on higher education. This is a committee that knows how to work. Senator HARKIN. the Senator from Iowa. and I have big ideological differences in our committee. but that doesnt stop us from working. from doing our job. We passed 19 bills out of our committee. and 10 of them have gone through the Senate and became law. No other committee in the Senate can say that. Right now we are working on this very subject of the political stunt. So why not stop the political stunt and put this where it belongsback in the committee that is already working on it in a bipartisan way. Lets focus on the veterans who are standing in line and do what the majority leader said. which is lets deal with that issue. Why do I say this student loan idea is not a serious proposal? It is not out of lack of respect to the sponsor. Of course I have great respect for her and for other Senators who are offering this proposal. But let me outline why I say this is not a serious proposal. And everybody in the Senate knows that. They know it is not going to pass. So why would the Senate waste time on it? No. 1. it does nothingnot one thingfor current or future students. For students who are in college today or will be tomorrow. this does nothing for them. So dont let the rhetoric fool you. No. 2. what does it do for people who used to be in college paying off a student loan? According to data supplied by the Congressional Research Service: It will give them $1 a day. For the typical former student who has old loans. this bill will give them a taxpayer subsidy of $1 a day to help pay their student loans. How big is that loan? For undergraduateswhich are 85 percent of all students with loansit is $21.600. For graduates with a 4year degree. it is $27.000. So $27.000probably the best investment a person will ever make. The College Board says that if you have a 4year degree. your lifetime earnings will be $1 million more. So $27.000 for a student with no credit rating and has a right to borrow that earns you $1 million? I think that is a pretty good deal. In fact. this $27.000. is about the exact amount of the average car loan. So what are we going to do next week? Instead of dealing with lines of veterans at clinics. is somebody going to come on the floor and say: Well. people have a $27.000 car loan. so lets raise taxes and raise the debt and give them $1 a day to pay off their car loan or the mortgage loan or the credit card. This is not a serious proposal. It is not going to help people. College graduates dont need a dollaraday tax subsidy to pay off their loan. They need a job. They need a job. and right now they are experiencing the worst situation for finding a job that they have seen in a long time. Now Republicans have plans that would help create more jobs. We would like to do what the President said. which was give the President more trade authority so companies in the nation can sell more things in Europe and Asia. but. no. we cannot bring that up. We would like to approve the Keystone Pipeline. but. no. we cannot bring that up. We would like to repeal ObamaCare and particularly the parts that make it harder to create jobs. but. no. we dont want to talk about that. We would like to at least change the provision about parttime jobs from 30 to 40 hours which affects millions of American workers. but. no. we cannot bring that up either. If the Senate wants to talk about students paying back loans. they dont need a dollar a day. they need a job. But my point is why should the Senate waste a week on this bill when veterans are standing in line waiting for us to take up and deal with a bipartisan proposal that the majority leader just described? What else is wrong with this student loan proposal? It could add up to $420 billion to the Federal debt. It does bring the money with it to eventually pay it off. we hope. but it adds to the debt. The Congressional Budget Office says national debt is rising at such a rate that interest payments will go from around $200 billion up to around $800 billion in 10 years. Taxpayers will be spending more on interest in 10 years than on national defense. It increases individual income taxes $72 billion with what I call a class warfare tax. That tax has been rejected eight times by the United States Senate. seven times on a motion to proceed. There already is a way to lower your payments if you are a student with a loan and your monthly payments are too high. It is in the law. The President talked about it this week. It is called the income based repayment plan. It could lower monthly payments $60 more a month than the Democrat proposal if you are a typical undergraduate and $300 more a month if you are a typical graduate student. Former students can do that today. That is a bigger savings on monthly payments than in the proposal we are debating. In addition to that. if this proposal were to pass the Senate. It could not be sent to the House. It is unconstitutional. We cannot originate a tax in the Senate. according to the Constitution. So why would the Senate pass this if it cannot be sent to the House? Next. it violates the Budget Control Act. We passed a law that said we couldnt spend any more than X. This measure violates that act. So if it gives a dollar a day to pay off a $27.000 loan at a time when a college degree will earn people more than $1 million. if the loans for undergraduates are about the same as a car loan. if it raises the debt by $420 billion. if it raises taxes by $72 billion. if there already is a way in the law to lower monthly payments more than this proposal without raising taxes. without raising the debt. without passing the law that is unconstitutionalso even if it did pass. it cannot be sent to the Houseif it violates the Budget Control Act. why would the Senate waste time on it when veterans are standing in line waiting for a bipartisan proposal to give them more choices for medical care? Why would we do that? Right behind the veterans bill are Senator MIKULSKI from Maryland and Senator SHELBY from Alabama with a series of appropriations bills that have bipartisan support. They have been through committee too. We havent passed appropriations bills in the last 4 yearstwo of those years we passed zero. one of those years we passed one. They are ready to do the job on both sides of the aisle. Why would we spend time on this if it doesnt deal with the real issue? Students with loans dont need a dollar a day to pay off the loan. They need a job. We have proposals for jobs. The real problems with student loans are complexities and overborrowing. Ninety percent of the loans we read about in the paper that are over $100.000 are loans held by graduate students. But these are only 2 percent of the loans for all students.

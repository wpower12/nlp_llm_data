1140012412,Thank you. Mr. COSTA. and thank you today for organizing this Special Order. Mr. Speaker. this is an important opportunity for us to come together and show how bipartisanship can fix our broken system. At home in Arizona. I hear from everyone that Washington is broken. There is too much time spent playing political games and too little time spent working together to get things done. Most people are sick and tired of Congress failing to do its job because of partisan politics. That is why I joined the Blue Dog Coalition. because they prioritize the people they represent more than their party leadership. Everybody knows that Congress is not working effectively. and the Blue Dogs are trying to change that. They are focused on ending political polarization. reforming Congress. stopping reckless government spending. and creating economic opportunity for Americans who have been left behind by this recession. Mr. Speaker. I come to work every single day to get things done for Arizona. I have a proven record of reaching out to members of both political parties to find common ground on issues ranging from jobs and the economy to reducing spending and government waste. As a cofounder of the United Solutions Caucus and a No Labels Problem Solver. I have worked with members of both parties to get things done. At home. Congressman MATT SALMON and I work together to help Arizona veterans get the care they deserve. and I have worked with Congressman MICHAEL MCCAUL to introduce legislation that puts an end to automatic pay raises for Members of Congress. Neither party is always right. In fact. both parties are often wrong. It is time for us to listen to each other and work together to grow our economy. help our countrys families. and honor our veterans. Recently. we came together to pass bipartisan legislation to prevent veteran suicide and improve access to mental health care and health services for veterans. Just this week. we agreed on legislation to expand college savings plans and make higher education a reality for students and their families. We need more of these kinds of accomplishments in Congress. In Arizona. the voters established an independent redistricting commission that allows for an open and transparent process and creates competitive districts where neither party has a monopoly. We Blue Dogs have proposed similar reforms to create impartial. fairly drawn districts across the country to cut back on the polarization that cripples our system. Mr. Speaker. the American people deserve leaders who do whatever it takes to come up with practical. commonsense solutions that help us move forward. It is time for us to focus on areas of common ground and come up with real answers to our countrys most pressing problems. So lets put aside the finger pointing and the fighting. Lets roll up our sleeves and get back to work.
1140018203,"Thank you. Ranking Member WATERS. for yielding. Mr. Speaker. manufactured housing is a key form of affordable housing in my State. particularly in rural and underserved communities. More than 300.000 families in Arizona live in manufactured homes. Manufactured homes provide an affordable housing choice for many low- and moderateincome families. Existing manufactured home owners and potential buyers are negatively impacted by current regulations. These rules inadvertently curtail a consumers ability to access manufactured home loans or to receive effective assistance in the manufactured home buying process. These regulations unintentionally create situations where borrowers are not allowed to be matched with lenders who can help them in a timely and efficient manner. For example. if a Realtor in Arizona works with a veteran who wants to use his or her VA eligibility to purchase a home. the Realtor connects the veteran with a number of lenders who offer VA home loans. Due to the current restrictions placed on retail salespeople. the process is different if a veteran shops for a manufactured home. Manufactured home sale centers have a marketing table where lenders place marketing and lending materials. Manufactured home salespeople cannot assist veterans in finding lenders. Instead. when a veteran enters the home center. she is instructed to go to the table and sift through the countless brochures and loan programs by herself to determine which lender is best. There may be a dozen different lenders information displayed on this table. As you can imagine. this is a very daunting and discouraging process for most borrowers. especially for firsttime home buyers. Had the salesperson simply been able to point the veteran in the direction of a lender that offers VA loans. the veteran would have been taken care of immediately and would have been able to have made an informed and confident decision. H.R. 650 will remedy the unintended consequences of current regulations. providing potential home buyers with more options. better advice. and more confidence when buying a new home. The bill also amends the definition of a ""highcost mortgage"" and corresponding thresholds to ensure that consumers of small balance mortgage loans will have the opportunity to access mortgage credit. I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation."
1140051883,Thank you. Congressman BENISHEK. for joining me today as a cohost of tonights Special Order. September is Suicide Prevention Month. a time for our Nation to raise awareness about the persistent scourge of suicide. Tens of thousands of Americans each year purposefully die by their own actions. They are our neighbors and our friends. our sons and our daughters. and too often. they are the men and women who have served our country honorably in the United States military. An estimated 22 veterans lose their lives to suicide every single day in our country. That is one life lost every 65 minutes. Typically. time in the House Chamber is split. Republicans have 1 hour and Democrats have another hour. but Congressman BENISHEK and I believe that this issue is too important to be overshadowed by partisan politics. That is why we have joined together today. with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. to show our commitment to solving this problem together and to finding real solutions for our countrys veterans. This is the third year we have assembled in this Chamber to raise awareness and to send a clear message that the epidemic of veteran suicide must end. We have so much work left to do. So today. we demonstrate our ongoing support for the individuals. organizations. and agencies devoted to preventing the epidemic of veteran suicide. Today. we challenge the VA. the Department of Defense. and our fellow lawmakers to do more. We are failing in our obligation to do right by those who have served so honorably. Finally. we send a message to military families who have experienced this tragedy in their own families: Your familys loss is not forgotten. We work for the memory of your loved ones. We will not rest until every veteran in this country has access to the care that he or she needs. I have often shared the story of a young veteran in my district. Sergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in Iraq. Diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Sergeant Somers took his own life after struggling with the VA bureaucracy and not getting the help he needed in time. Together with the Somers family. we worked to develop the Classified Veterans Access to Care Act to ensure that all veterans. including those who served with classified experiences. can get immediate access to the mental health care that they need in the appropriate care setting. I recently testified before the House Veterans Affairs Committee on the need for this important legislation. and I am grateful for the committees support for this legislation. I am grateful for my cosponsor. Congressman DAN
1140051920,Mr. Speaker and Members. before I close with the closing statements. I want to take a moment and honor and thank Congressman BENISHEK not just for the work he has done tonight or the work he has done on the Veterans Committee. but for the great work he has done in Congress for the last three terms. We are sad that you are retiring. We will miss you. But we have one more chance to do this Special Order again next year. and I look forward to that time. So thank you for your help and for your service. Congressman BENISHEK has not just been a partner to me in the work that we have been doing to help and support veterans. he has been a leader in the Veterans Committee and in his conference and in this House of Representatives. I know. when he leaves this body. he will continue to be a shining light for veterans around this country. Thank you. Congressman. I want to close with a story about a veteran in my district. We recently received a call from David. a constituent of mine who is an Army veteran and a survivor of two suicide attempts. David told us: My mind was plagued with feelings that my parents and siblings would be better off without me because of who I had become as a person. I felt savage and inhuman. No matter what good I did. I couldnt face going back to a normal existence. I had never felt more alone in my life. Through much time and assistance from organizations like the Wounded Warrior Project and mental and physical rehabilitation programs. David gained a new mission in life. He is helping his fellow veterans navigate a daunting system and reintegrate back into civilian life. David wants his fellow warriors to understand that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. His mission of supporting veterans led David to Rally Point. a Phoenix nonprofit veteran service organization working to assist veterans in crisis. Rally Point employs veterans like David who understand the unique needs of fellow veterans. servicemembers. and their families. These are the kinds of solutions we need to ensure that no veteran ever feels like he or she has nowhere to turn. We have made some progress. In February of this year. the President signed the Clay Hunt SAV Act into law. an important step toward improving mental health services for veterans and their families. This bipartisan legislation requires annual thirdparty evaluations of the VAs mental healthcare and suicide prevention programs to determine which programs are successful and to recommend improvements. It also requires collaboration on suicide prevention efforts between the VA and nonprofit mental health organizations. and it establishes a pilot program using peer support and community outreach to assist veterans transitions from Active Duty. We cannot leave our heroes to fight their toughest battles alone. Thank you again to all of our colleagues who joined us this evening. Our thoughts are with all the families who have lost a loved one to suicide. Each of us can do something to raise awareness. to be that light for a struggling veteran in our community. Businesses can display signs to let veterans know that help is always available. Mental health professionals can volunteer with organizations like Give an Hour to provide free counseling to veterans and their families. We can all learn to recognize the signs of crisis by visiting veteranscrisisline.net and reaching out to the vets in our life. Here in Congress. we can do more. We need a VA that provides real and meaningful help to veterans in need that puts veterans first and works aggressively with community providers to improve the quality and accessibility of care. We need a VA that is transparent and open to restore the trust and credibility it has lost. We. who enjoy freedom every day thanks to the sacrifices of our military servicemembers. must all step up to end the epidemic of veteran suicide. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140052957,Madam Speaker. this motion to recommit is the final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If this amendment is adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. This motion is straightforward and commonsense. The motion ensures that nothing in this bill prohibits a womans access to healthcare services. This amendment protects the health of American women. I believe a womans personal healthcare decisions should be decided by the woman. her family. and her doctor. Women and their families should be able to make these decisions free from government interference. Despite our political differences. protecting the health. safety. and independence of American women is something that most of us in this Chamber can readily support. It is what the American people want and believe. The American people and people in my home State of Arizona want Congress to put aside partisanship and focus on solving our countrys great challenges. They want Congress to focus on growing our economy. creating opportunity for hardworking families. making college affordable. reforming the VA. and strengthening our military and national security. The list goes on and on. It is no surprise that Republicans and Democrats alike think that Congress is a mess. but Congress doesnt have to be a mess. Congress can produce results when it puts partisanship aside and works for the American people. Earlier this year. we worked together to find a real solution to the longterm challenge of reimbursing doctors through Medicaid. We replaced the SGR and protected seniors access to health care. That is the kind of success we can achieve for the American people if we work together. We also worked together to help prevent veteran suicide and improve access to mental health care for veterans. The Clay Hunt SAV Act. which passed with the support of every Member of Congress. is an important step toward ending the epidemic of veteran suicide in our country. That is the kind of work we can do for our veterans when we work together. We worked together to pass the 21st Century Cures Act to encourage biomedical innovation and the development of lifesaving treatments and cures. This creative. bipartisan approach cuts through red tape. allowing innovators to focus on lifesaving discoveries rather than government bureaucracy. These are the solutions we can create when we work together. Last night. we passed the PACE Act. which enables employees at small- and mediumsized businesses to keep their health insurance plans. This is the kind of bipartisan work we can accomplish. If we work together. we can get things done for the American people. We can find a longterm sustainable solution to funding our highways and infrastructure. we can pass a budget that creates jobs and opportunity. grows our economy. and improves our national security. and we can reform our broken Tax Code so it provides certainty. encourages job growth. and enables us to compete on a global scale. Instead. Ive watched Congress fight once again in a partisan way. without a bipartisan solution on the horizon. This is not what Arizonans want. It is not what the American people want. I offer this motion today to stand for something we all agree on. protecting the health of women. and I ask my colleagues to support this reasonable motion. Madam Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140074967,"The Streamlining Excessive and Costly Regulations Review Act is about accountable and representative government and making sure that the SEC is taking an ongoing retrospective look at its regulation. This legislation would simply require the SEC to review its major rules and regulations on a regular basis to determine whether they are still effective or outdated or whether they need to be changed in some regard. In fact. other prudential regulators. such as the FDIC. the OCC. and the Federal Reserve. are already doing this. During the mid1990s. the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act. or EGRPRA. required these entities to conduct a retrospective review of all of their regulations to determine if they were still effective and. subsequently. report their findings to Congress. Because the House Banking Committee at the time did not have jurisdiction over the SEC. the SEC was left out of this process. Title V would simply require the SEC to retrospectively review its regulations with the goal of ensuring that they are effective and up to date. It would enable the SEC to operate in the most effective manner possible. It would afford the SEC the autonomy and flexibility to make this mandate effective. President Obama himself endorsed this idea in multiple 2011 executive orders. and the other prudential regulators are already operating under a similar review process. This legislation simply puts the SEC on the same playing field as the other regulators. Moreover. this bill provides Congress with the insight it needs to hold the Commission accountable. and the legislation adheres to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. All said. the structure and the process of title V will provide industry. the SEC. and Congress. with the structure and time necessary to ensure that this retrospective review process is effective. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this title so that we can continue to improve the SECs regulatory regime. In closing. let me again thank the committee chairman. Chairman HENSARLING. and Chairman GARRETT. who is our Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee chair. for making these two provisions a part of this act. I urge my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on this good bill."
1140074987,Mr. Chairman. I thank Chairman HENSARLING for including legislation to review outdated and unnecessary regulation in this important bill. And thank you to Congressman HURT for working across the aisle with me to advance this commonsense measure. Business owners in Arizona regularly tell me that our inefficient and often confusing regulatory environment hurts their ability to grow and hire. This commonsense legislation requires the SEC to improve and repeal outdated regulations. holding them accountable. and providing certainty for businesses and consumers in Arizona. This bill requires the SEC to within 5 years of enactment and then once every 10 years thereafter review all significant SEC rules and determine by Commission vote whether they are outmoded. ineffective. insufficient. excessively burdensome or are no longer in the public interest or consistent with the SECs mission to protect investors. facilitate capital formation. and maintain fair. orderly. and efficient markets. The Commission would then be required to provide notice and solicit public comment on whether such rules should be amended or repealed and then amend or repeal any such rule by vote in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. Finally. the Commission would report to Congress within 45 days after any final vote. including any suggestions for legislative changes. The bill would require the SEC to only review major or significant rules. It would not allow mandatory rulemakings to be repealed unilaterally by the SEC. Should the SEC determine that legislation is necessary to amend or repeal a regulation. the bill requires the Commission to include in their report to Congress recommendations for such legislation. Finally. the bill would prevent additional litigation by clarifying that the initial SEC vote would not be subject to judicial review. I believe that reviewing significant rules at the SEC. as directed by the administrations executive order. is a worthwhile use of SEC resources. I hope Members join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation. Thank you. Chairman HENSARLING and Congressman HURT. for advancing this important legislation.
1140081963,Mr. Speaker. I thank Congressman ZELDIN for organizing this Special Order hour and for bringing attention to this important issue. An estimated 22 American veterans die by suicide every day. These men and women are our neighbors and our friends. our sons and our daughters. our mothers and our fathers. Veteran suicide is too important an issue to be overshadowed by bipartisan politics. It is why we have come together tonight to show our commitment to veterans who have given so much to keep America safe. We must do moreCongress. the VA. the American publicto end the epidemic of veteran suicide and to ensure veterans and their families have access to the best possible mental health care. This is a responsibility we all share. That is why I support Congressman ZELDINs legislation. the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Veterans Peer Support program. to expand access to peertopeer counseling for veterans. A battle buddy can open the door to the care and support a veteran needs. and we must support efforts to expand the availability and accessibility of mental health care. No one who returns home from serving our country should ever feel like he or she has nowhere to turn. I have often shared this story of a young veteran in my district. Sergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran with two tours in Iraq. Diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress disorder. Sergeant Somers ultimately took his own life after struggling with the VA bureaucracy and not getting the help he needed in time. Together with the Somers family. we have worked to develop legislation to ensure that all veterans. including those with classified experiences. get immediate access to mental health services in the appropriate care setting. The Daniel Somers Act was combined with Congresswoman JULIA BROWNLEYs Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act and passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. Senator JON TESTER introduced companion legislation in the Senate. and we continue to work to get this bill signed into law. I pledge to continue working with my colleagues to ensure that no veteran feels trapped like Sergeant Somers did and that all of our veterans have access to appropriate mental health care. Mr. Speaker. I thank Congressman ZELDIN for his work on behalf of our veterans and for hosting this bipartisan Special Order on veterans mental health care.
1140106983,Mr. Speaker. I thank Chairman FITZPATRICK and Ranking Member LYNCH. Over the course of the past year. the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing has found that U.S. Government efforts to counter the financing of terrorism lack sufficient coordination and that the United States has no unified national strategy to guide our counterfinancing efforts. The Federal Government must change its approach and mindset to counter the financing of terrorism. and this is why Chairman FITZPATRICK and I introduced this bipartisan legislation to direct the Secretary of the Treasury. in coordination with relevant Federal agencies. to establish a wholeofgovernment strategy to combat the financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit finance. This strategy must include: a critical assessment of the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to fight terrorist financing. ways to improve coordination with international. State. and local law enforcement and the private sector. and a comprehensive discussion of threats. goals. objectives. and priorities for disrupting and preventing terrorist financing. The strategy should enhance detection. deterrence. prosecution. and ultimately strengthen our broader national security goals. Our legislation forces the Federal Government to create a wholeofgovernment strategy to counter terrorism financing that improves the effectiveness of our efforts and better aligns these efforts with our broader national interests. Terrorism is an undeniable threat to our countrys security and global stability. Terrorist networks constantly develop new ways to finance their deadly operations and threaten America. The Islamic State is one of the worlds most violent. dangerous. and wellfinanced terrorist groups. To keep our country safe. we must be one step ahead of ISIS. cutting off its funding and stopping its efforts. I thank Chairman FITZPATRICK and Congresswoman VELAZQUEZ for allowing me to join and work with them on this important legislation. I thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS for establishing this important task force. and I thank Chairman FITZPATRICK and Ranking Member LYNCH for their leadership on the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep money out of terrorists hands and build on our progress to strengthen Americas security.

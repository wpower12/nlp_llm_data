1140029579,"Mr. Chairman. as cochairman of the Congressional Sportsmens Caucus. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1335. the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act. and would like to thank my colleagues. Chairman Ron BISHOP and Subcommittee Chairman DON YOUNG. for all their efforts to bring this important piece of legislation to the House floor for a vote. Mr. Chairman. according to the latest report released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. in 2012. the U.S. domestic seafood industry had a sales impact of $141 billion and supported approximately 1.3 million jobs. H.R. 1335 makes the necessary reforms to support these jobs and our fishermen by promoting better science and requiring State and local data to be considered in Federal decisionmaking about fisheries. Last year I spoke with commercial fishermen from the Pacific Coast. Atlantic Coast. and the Gulf of Mexico. and the common theme in our discussions was the need for better data and scientific analysis to improve management. The U.S. has a long and profitable heritage in fishing. To continue that heritage. we need to have quality. diverse data and scientific analysis to facilitate educated decisionmaking on fishery management. H.R. 1335 allows for just that. Mr. Chairman. the bill increases transparency and provides muchneeded flexibility in the law for fishery managers to properly consider the environmental and economic impacts of decisions affecting fishing communities. And it is important to note that H.R. 1335 makes all of these key reforms to fisheries management without authorizing any new additional Federal spending. We can do the job with the existing resources. This bill also makes great strides in the saltwater recreational fisheries. Saltwater recreational fishing alone has a $70 billion impact on our Nations economy and supports over 454.000 jobs. Marinas. grocery stores. restaurants. motels. lodges. tackle shops. boat dealerships. clothing manufacturers. gas stations. and a host of other businesses and entities benefit from the money spent by recreational anglers. This industry does not just impact coastal communities but enables job creation and robust economic development in a variety of regions across the country. Improving recreational data collection and a transparent review of allocations in the Southeast are all great tools that H.R. 1335 gives NOAA to effectively manage a recreational industry that is a significant economic player in the United States economy. H.R. 1335 is widely supported by a coalition of sportsmen and conservation groups. including the Congressional Sportsmens Foundation and the Center for Coastal Conservation. I urge my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on H.R. 1335 in support of access to our Nations resources and the 1.3 million jobs that are supported by fishing."
1140029694,Mr. Chairman. my amendment would give the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA. Fisheries the authority to implement management practices better suited to the nature and scope of recreational fishing. I hope we can all agree that commercial and recreational fisheries are fundamentally different activities. with dissimilar harvest data collection systems that can benefit from different management techniques. Commercial fisheries are managed for yield. Commercial landings can usually be counted or weighed in realtime. thus. quotas can be enforced in realtime. This allows managers to close a fishery well before the allowable catch is exceeded. In short. a commercial fisherys catch can be managed in realtime based on data from verified landings. Recreational fisheries are different and should be managed for expectation. as opposed to yield. Anglers fish for a variety of reasons. but a lack of fish will make them go less frequently or stop altogether. Anglers and fishermen need to believe they will have opportunity to encounter fish. with the hopes they may catch some. possibly including some large enough to take home. Instead of yield. abundance and age structure are key elements to recreational fisheries since those factors govern both the rate of encounters and the size of fish caught. Maximizing yield has little meaning in most recreational fisheries. That is why NOAAs National Marine Fisheries Service should manage recreational fisheries based on expected longterm harvest rates. not strictly on yield or poundagebased quotas. This strategy has been successfully used by State fisheries managers in our freshwater and coastal fisheries. providing exceptional recreational fishing opportunities while ensuring sustainable fish populations. By managing the recreational sector based on harvest rate as opposed to a poundagebased quota. managers have been able to provide predictability in regulations while also sustaining a healthy population. While the MagnusonStevens Act does not specifically prohibit such an approach. it should specifically direct the National Marine Fisheries Service and regional councils to consider alternative strategies to commercial management for appropriate recreationally valuable fisheries. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that provides additional flexibility to improve the management of important recreational fisheries. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140033762,Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. These important provisions that are already included in the law have been included in the past several appropriations bills for several years running. and there is a reason that they are there. This wording represents a strong and enduring consensus in Congress that Guantanamo should remain open and that detainees should not be transferred to the United States for any reason. This is debated back and forth in agreement on both sides of the aisle. Striking these provisions would have unknown consequences for a number of U.S. communities. and it is impossible for any of us to know how many detainees might be brought there. where they might be held. and the impacts on communities and facilities that are holding them. It is also impossible to know what the cost might be. so we are asking for this unknown to be pursued without knowing the risks or knowing the costs. Putting detainees in U.S. prisons. as the administration originally proposed. would be disruptive and potentially disastrous. We know former FBI Director Mueller had stated: To transfer detainees to local jails could affect or infect other prisoners or have the capability of affecting events outside the prison system. The last thing we need today in the face of ISIS is to convert more folks to extremism. The idea of bringing detainees for trials in the United States quickly collapsed as local jurisdictions voiced their strong opposition. We heard that across the United States. As everyone here is aware. several detainees that have been released from Guantanamo have gone back to the fight and killed and wounded Americans. The threat is real. and Guantanamo is already equipped to handle the detention and military trial of these individuals as appropriate. Any proposal that results in these detainees being sent to the United States for any reason is simply the wrong policy. We have tread this ground time and time and time again. I therefore oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.
1140053758,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to ask Congress to vote in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY16. I am proud that this conference report takes significant steps towards rebuilding our military and readiness. We prioritize training for our troops and maintenance and modernization of our equipment and technology. This NDAA is critical to carry out the military missions of this Nation effectively and successfully in an increasingly dangerous world. Recently. former Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger proclaimed: ""The United States has not faced a more diverse and complex array of crises since the end of the Second World War."" This statement holds true today as we combat ISIS in the Middle East. as Russia again tests our commitment to global leadership. and as China continues to increase its defense spending to record levels. Mr. Speaker. Congress has a constitutional duty of providing for the common defense of our Nation. If Congress and the President fail to act on the NDAA. we forgo our constitutional duty. and we weaken the security of our Nation and ability to confront crises that occur around the globe. It is also important to point out that this is not the time to play political games with our national security or to hold hostage funding and authorization for the military for political gain. Our Nation and our men and women in the military deserve better. and they deserve the proper support that Congress is under obligation to provide. As we have heard through testimony from our military leaders before the committee. our military is approaching the ragged edge of being able to execute our Nations defense strategy. By not passing this NDAA. or by allowing sequestration to continue to devastate our Nations military readiness. we place ourselves in a position where we will be unable to defend against the threats we face today and in the future. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act of FY16."
1140078742,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for his leadership as vice chairman of the Congressional Sportsmens Caucus. We have heard a lot of. I think. good efforts today in wanting to ensure that our sportsmen and our sportswomen have access to Federal properties. to make sure they can enjoy outdoor sports. I think that is absolutely critical. That is what this bill is about. It is about clarifying to make sure that it is the legislative body that does the directing. not the bureaucrats. I want to make sure there is a balance there because we hear each and every day from our constituents about what they feel needs to happen with their land. We must remember this land belongs to the taxpayers. and we must find responsible ways to make sure that there is access to that land for everyone. I want to make sure that we do that. I believe that this bill achieves that. I understand. too. that we want to make sure that their voices are heard. Many times from the side of these agencies. they will consider comments. but many times the comments arent included. This ensures that Congress has a role in defining what those opportunities are. I want to make sure those voices are heard. I cant help but believe that everyone here is in favor of making sure that their voices are heard and that opportunities exist across all these Federal lands for our outdoorsmen. our sportsmen and -women of this Nation. I want to make sure. too. that we are clear that all of us are against stopping the illegal trafficking of ivory. All of us here want to make sure that stops. I think there are reasonable and thoughtful ways that do that that dont inhibit the sportsmen who want to go there to be part of the legal process to harvest an elephant in the areas where there is an overpopulation. The dollars there are used to support local populations in that area. villages. None of that animal is wasted. Every bit of it is used. The fees that are collected for hunters are put into stopping the poaching effort there. I think those are sustainable models to make sure that elephant populations continue in those areas and that we. indeed. have the ability and resources in Africa to stop those efforts by poachers. I think sustainable hunting is a way to do that. In any way impeding the flow of ivory back into the United States from legal hunting operations doesnt allow us to do that. Making sure. too. that it is simple and straightforward for owners of ivory to continue to own that. especially those pieces that are family heirlooms. and not have to go through a long. drawnout bureaucratic process to prove that something is yours that has been passed down through family history where you may not have documentation to do that. These efforts that U.S. Fish and Wildlife agencies are putting forward would make it in many instances very. very difficult for individuals and families to demonstrate that. Lets make this process easy and lets get at the issue. and that is the illegally harvested ivory that is coming out of Africa to the United States. We talked. too. about access elements. We heard the number used that 99 percent of our ocean waters are open to fishing. to recreational fishing. But remember that the entire ocean is different in its habitats. So fish live in certain areas. I would argue that the 1 percent that is being closed off many times is the most productive area for fishermen. It is where the habitat rests. It is where the fish are. So if you were to say. dont worry about it. you can hunt the entire Sahara Desert. that wouldnt mean much to sportsmen. The same that you are saying if you are allowed to fish these other areas that dont hold the habitat that allow fish to live in those areas also doesnt keep in mind making sure that recreational fishermen have access to the place where fish live. So I want to make sure that that is clear when we talk about these numbers. 99 percent versus the 1 percent. Remember. this bill is not about what is not included. It is about really making those opportunities available for those men and women who hunt. fish. and use the outdoors. I am in full support of LWCF. I am in full support of NAWCA. I do believe that we ought to reauthorize those pieces of legislation. and I do believe that there are mechanisms to do that. I believe that the vast majority of folks on our Committee on Natural Resources. as well as in Congress. want to see those things happening. The difficulty always is in taking one bill and adding a bunch of different elements to it. I think those bills are important enough that they deserve their own level of debate and own level of attention about what we do in reauthorizing those bills. I think folks outside the 90 square miles of Washington look at us and say. you know. why are you putting all these other elements into a bill rather than debating them individually? I think we can put too much into a piece of legislation where it becomes confusing and it doesnt get after the true purpose behind the original bill. We tried to put together pieces that were similar in scope but didnt include other areas that really deserve their own level of debate. So that is the reason that LWCF and NAWCA was left out of this. not by any intention to say we shouldnt address those. but by understanding that we have a responsibility to try to keep these packages of bills as simple and straightforward as we can. Also. when we talk about lead. remember that the lead we talk about is in things like fishing sinkers. Remember. fishing sinkers are used in water. The gentlewoman from California talked about the issue with California condors. Well. California condors are not an aquatic bird. so I dont think we have to worry about them swimming in water and getting hold of these fishing sinkers. The same way with bullets. I understand there are a few instances where they might have found a bullet associated with ingestion with a California condor. but the vast majority of shooting sports are put forth in legal ranges where the lead ends up in the ground. It ends up in the ground at a shooting range. Remember. that is the exact area where the lead came from. So returning it to the ground where we know eventually through the years it does indeed decay. it does indeed break down. those things are legal and I think environmentally responsible ways that lead is used in both hunting and fishing. Lets not stop those efforts. I want to make sure that those things happen. If there are specific issues related to the California condor. I think we ought to address that. but these carte blanche onesizefitsall efforts to say lets ban lead across the spectrum in the shooting sports. for hunting. and for fishing doesnt get at those root issues and it creates unnecessary burdens on folks who are using those in a legal way and in a way that doesnt affect our fish and wildlife populations. So I want to make sure that those things continue. I do believe that there are many more areas of agreement than disagreement on this bill. I think that we have talked to folks on many aspects of this. It is different in its scope with the Senate bill. and I look forward to its successful passage out of this House and for our ability to bring it to a conference committee in the Senate and to work through those particular differences between the House and the Senate bill. Mr. Chairman. I would urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2406. the SHARE Act. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140079175,Mr. Chairman. I certainly agree with the gentleman from California that the duck stamp program is a great program. It does a tremendous amount of good. We all know the wetlands that are preserved with that. We all know it is a great opportunity for the hunting community and the conservation community to come together. As you know. last year. the duck stamp fee was increased. for the first time in 24 years. from $15 to $25. I. myself. am an avid duck hunter. I buy multiple duck stamps because I firmly believe in the program. The increase last year we believe will yield about $119 million over 10 years. but we also know. looking historically. that when you put these increases in fees. for the first couple of years the revenue drops because people that would buy them without the need dont do that. and then they come back to actually purchasing it. So we understand that. That is why we have asked the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to look specifically at how the implementation of this fee is going to play out and how the costs associated with the program are. so that we can understand how to best manage this. as you said. to get the most dollars to wetlands conservation. With the idea of now going to an inflationary factor right on the heels of a $10 increase without getting. from the Fish and Wildlife Service. what the impacts are going to be so we can best maximize the dollars. I think. is premature. I serve as a member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. and still. I believe the responsibility for any type of increases should still be on the backs of all Members of Congress. not just the four that are on the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. I applaud the gentlemans effort to draw attention to the duck stamp program. We all understand the good it does. but I would argue that this inflationary increase measure is premature. especially in the face of a $10 increase last year. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. I would oppose this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140079415,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding and thank him for his leadership. As you have heard. this is just a commonsense bill. and I rise in strong support of S. 1580. the Competitive Services Act. I want to thank my colleague from Virginia. GERRY CONNOLLY. for his effort. along with my staff. in putting together the House version of this bill. It is just a commonsense. bicameral. and bipartisan bill that allows agencies in a very complex and competitive world to aggressively and timely recruit individuals for these positions. We want to get individuals into those positions quickly. and we want to understand where the talent lies so that these agencies can communicate back and forth. Many times that silo approach doesnt work. This breaks down those silos and allows agencies to share information about these applicants. In todays world when we need to. in a timely way. gets folks into the cybersecurity realm. we need to get folks into the information technology realm. and even in the veterans healthcare realm where we need to get healthcare providers there quickly. especially when there is demand. this is the perfect way to do that. When we go through the effort of having these individuals apply for these jobs. we know what their qualifications are. There is no reason why we shouldnt be sharing this information. It allows us to act in the best interests of taxpayers. it cuts down on the amount of expense that is put forth in recruiting these individuals. and it ensures that we get things done on time. We understand. too. the talent pool that is out there. Many times. too. if you look at it and say that these are the individuals who are available and even if there is a challenge in getting somebody. you can immediately see that. instead of having to wait for time to communicate back and forth between agencies and say. ""Well. it doesnt look like in this area that we have the number of individuals that we need. what is the next course of action?"" this allows us to get through all of those particular issues and get people in these positions as quickly as possible. It is just a commonsense piece of legislation that allows our managers to manage in the most effective way possible. It allows us to do the best job for our country. and it allows the best use of taxpayers dollars. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support S. 1580."
1140092341,"Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank Chairman THORNBERRY. Ranking Member SMITH. and the ranking member on the Readiness Subcommittee. MADELEINE BORDALLO. for all of their efforts. Chairman THORN3ERRY over the last few months has highlighted the significant readiness challenges and budget choices we are facing. The reality is that these decisions we make here will affect the strength of our national security for years to come. The American people are concerned. And why shouldnt they be? The readiness obstacles that we face force our military leaders to choose between providing adequate training and equipment for troops at home and supporting our men and women who are already fighting on the front lines. We have heard verified media reports. for instance. that aircraft mechanics have taken drastic measures. even attempting to strip parts from museum pieces. to keep our fighters and bombers flying. We have heard testimony from each of our service branches about how critical it is for us to address our military readiness shortfalls. What we have heard has been sobering. to say the least. Today we are called to address these maintenance. sustainment. and readiness issues. That is our constitutional duty. I believe that this bill will move us toward that end goal of restoring fullspectrum readiness. This bill. for example. prohibits the Department from implementing another round of base realignment and closure in the absence of an accurate end strength assessment and it streamlines the Department of Defenses civilian hiring practices so that critical manpower capability gaps can be filled. Most importantly. this bill also includes more than $5 billion in additional funds for. among other things. ship and aircraft depot maintenance. aviation training and readiness. and longneglected facility sustainment. restoration. and modernization accounts. Our military. an overruling force for good. is supported by the finest men and women in the world. They deserve our support in return. At the same time. I would like to note that these recommendations dont fully alleviate my concerns about our readiness shortfalls. Here in Washington we need to make sure that we fully understand what is at stake and how the choices we make affect those who serve and sacrifice on our behalf. We have to continue to focus on restoring readiness in the years to come and make sure that we properly man. train. and equip our forces so that they can meet the challenges on the horizon with the confidence and superiority we have come to expect. I ask the Members of the House to support this National Defense Authorization Act and vote ""yes"" on H.R."
1140093126,Mr. Chairman. I want to reiterate the importance of making sure that we are funding defense at the Presidents request. The FY 2017 request. I think. is minimally adequate. but it is not just me. The administrations own Secretary of the Army Murphy stated that this budget request is minimally adequate and that we are taking a high risk as an Army and as a Nation when the Army is funded at this level. So there is still risk there with this level of funding. As the chairman pointed out. we live in a more dangerous world today. but we see our Marine Corps and Air Force having to go to aircraft that are museum exhibits to cannibalize parts to bring them in to have a minimally operational cadre of aircraft. We see this. too. when we talk about only 9 of the 20 B1 bombers are available today because they are lacking parts and when we have 30 percent or less of our Marine Corps helicopters available because they are lacking parts. We see that. in a squadron of 14 jets. only 3 in the Marine Corps are available because they are lacking parts. It is irresponsible not to provide to the brave men and women that serve this Nation the things that they need. We are asking them to go into harms way. We are asking them to do tremendously difficult jobs. We are asking them to maintain safety. Yet we are not providing them the resources necessary. This amendment would do even more to take away what is already a challenging situation for those brave men and women that are doing a tremendous job and that. as their leaders have said. are being stressed to the breaking point because they do not have the basic resources to keep those aircraft flying. to keep those ships on the water. to keep those systems necessary to be able to perform the job that we have asked them to do. We have an obligation as a Nation that. when we ask those brave men and women to go into harms way. to support them. It is unconscionable when we dont do that. when we have situations like 84 percent of our Marine Corps aircraft are in a nonready status. based on a 10year average. So when we talk about taking dollars away. what signal does that send to the brave men and women serving in the military? I think this amendment cuts to the heart of what we must do as a Nation. and that is to rebuild readiness. not degrade readiness.

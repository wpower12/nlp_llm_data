1130011922,Mr. President. I rise today in support of the Marketplace Fairness Act. This act will level the playing field for small business retailers in Minnesota and across the country. I want to thank Senator ENZI for his years of work on this. He had a retail shoe store. I thank Senator DURBIN. Senator HEITKAMP. and Senator ALEXANDER for introducing this legislation. This legislation will simply allow States to help their brickandmortar retailers. including the momandpop shops on Main Street. stay competitive in a marketplace where online sales have become a fact of life. The amendment we offered to the budget resolution today lays the groundwork for passing that legislation. It is a commonsense measure which brings our sales tax into the 21st century. In Minnesota. the retail industry includes nearly a half million workers. which is about one in five jobs in our State. Those retailers need to compete on price and service every single day. The current sales tax system makes it impossible for them to compete. Senator CARDIN spoke about something that is very common around this country. I have heard the same exact story myself. It is where someone walks into an electronics store and wants to buy a big flatscreen TV. and they get the guy who knows everything to come over and point out what is the best for their needs. The salesman is a very skilled guy. He was hired because he knows what he is doing. He sells the TV. except he doesnt sell it. not for his store. Instead. the customer gets on their smart phone and buys it online. They buy the same exact model at the same exact price. but because he or she doesnt have to pay the sales taxthey are supposed to. by the way. but they dontthey buy it online. They end up saving $100 and the brickandmortar store. which pays for employees. sewer. schools. and everything which makes a society work. loses the sale and cannot compete. It is just not fair. It is just not fair. This is a commonsense amendment. Small businesses have an exemption. The exemption is written in the amendment. People cannot say. well. just because they have an exemption. we are going to get rid of the exemption in some way. It is an exemption that is a part of the amendment we are proposing. I am proud to be on this bill. I am proud of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The Marketplace Fairness Act is common sense. it is bipartisan. and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. I yield the floor.
1130020511,"and Mr. HARKINindicating the wide reach of the inland waterways system and its impact on so many industries in so many States across the country. The current ratethe barge user fee of 20 cents per gallonright now is not raising sufficient funding to keep up with operations and maintenance needs along the reach of the system. If we do not make this investment now. it could have dire consequences to multibilliondollar industries that rely on the use of locks and dams to move their goods. Just consider coal being one of those examples. All 300 users of the inland waterways system support this increase. Let me say that again because this does not happen very much in Washington: All 300 users of the inland waterways system support this barge user fee increase from 20 cents per gallon to 29 cents per gallon. Here we have an example of an industry that is forward looking in asking Congress to allow them to pay more in order to make critical investments in their own infrastructure. In addition to the support of industry. the user fee increase is backed by a diverse array of organizations across the country. including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. the National Farmers Union. the National Association of Manufacturers. the American Farm Bureau. the AFLCIO. and over 250 national and local organizations. including barge operators. agriculture. energy and civics and conservation groups. In southwestern Pennsylvania alone over 200.000 jobs rely on the proper functioning of locks and dams on the lower Monongahela River. For those who do not know. it is a river on the western end of our State that flows into the city of Pittsburghone of the three rivers we describe as part of our landscape in Pittsburgh. If one of these locks were to fail. it would endanger all 200.000 jobs and have a negative impact of over $1 billion just in that region. not to mention the adverse impact beyond the region. Raising the user fee now will help prevent a catastrophe in the near future. I understand there are objections to addressing important concerns about including a funding fix for locks and dams in this bill due to the socalled blueslip concerns that involve the House of Representatives. I will work to look for other vehicles so we do not continue to kick this can down the road. and I will talk to Members of the House to include this fix in their version. If we cannot raise revenue on an industry that is asking to pay more so they can invest in their infrastructure. I am afraid the future of our waterways system is in great jeopardy. Many of my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle recognize the importance of providing a way to pay for investments we need in our locksanddams system. and I urge the House to follow suit. I have no doubt they want to do the same. We cannot squander critical foundations that have made America what it is. Reinvesting in our Nations waterways will allow us to seize economic opportunities to remain competitive in the world and protect and create jobs for generations to come. I will note one citation of history. from a major volume in Pennsylvania history. This goes back to the 1800s when we developed a canal system to move commodities and commerce across our waterways. I will read one sentence from page 180 of a book entitled ""Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth."" Here is what they said all those years ago in the 1800s. talking about coal: Through those routes. anthracite coal left Pennsylvania for England. Russia. Central Europe and Asia. But the reason that coal was able to get to those places is because we had a system in place to move it. What we do not want to have today in our time is a system that breaks down because we are not willing to make the investment. As I said before. this investment is supported by all of those organizations but especially the 300 users who are willing to invest more so that tomorrow will be bright and we can move commerce across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across our country. I yield the floor."
1130024213,Mr. President. I would like to associate myself with the wise words of my colleague from Missouri. whose State has experienced so much tragedy last year much like the devastation in Oklahoma. On behalf of the State of Minnesota. our hearts and thoughts are with the people of Oklahoma. I would also like to thank Senator BLUNT for cosponsoring an amendment in the farm bill which will make it easier for seniors and those with disabilities to receive groceries in their homes that is delivered by volunteers. They pay for it with their SNAP dollars. I am grateful to the whole Senate for adopting the farm bill package by unanimous consent. I am very grateful for that. I am very pleased the Senate has taken up the farm bill. and I hope we can pass this in the Senate and the House so our Nations farmers have the certainty they need to provide food for the rest of us. There are so many important pieces to this bill which will be great for Minnesota and Wisconsin. For example. it contains provisions to support beginning and young farmers to help them start farming operations. I think the average age of a farmer in Minnesota is about 58. We need young and beginning farmers. The farm bill also contains important conservation measures so farmers can better protect their land. It also contains a comprehensive energy titlethat I helped to writein order to make our agriculture sector and our Nation more energy independent. Above all. the farm bill provides a safety net for farmers. and that safety net is the centerpiece of this bill. The reason it is there is because agriculture is inherently risky. Just last year we witnessed a historic drought which devastated the Nations corn and soybean crops and forced ranchers to cull their livestock. Agriculture is prone to weather disruption such as drought. flood. hail. pests. disease. and global market forces which can drastically disrupt prices. and that is why the farm bill safety net is so essential and important. The farm bill safety net provides disaster assurance for livestock producers. and it contains crop insurance so farmers have certainty over their planting decisions. It also contains a dairy program to make sure we have a healthy dairy economy in Wisconsin. Minnesota. Vermont. New York. and other States. That is why we have the Sugar Program. to help protect our sugar growers. The program is important to Minnesotas sugar growers and to growers across the Nation. In addition to protecting farmers. these programs enhance the domestic supply of food that is so important to our Nation. Unfortunately. some of my colleagues dont support a strong farm safety net. and they have decided to go after the Sugar Program in the farm bill this year. Lets be clear about one thing: By attacking the Sugar Program. or any other farm safety net. they are helping to send jobs overseas. Ironically. this attack comes just a week after 60 Senators supported a provision to make sure some of the funds used in water infrastructure projects are used to purchase U.S. iron and U.S. steel. Some of the very same Senators who are fighting for a domestic steel industry are now turning their backs on our farmers by pulling the plug on our Sugar Program. I also heard some argue that we should just let the free market work. Madam President. did you know that the government of Mexico is Mexicos biggest producer and exporter of sugar? That is not much of a free market. Brazil. the worlds largest sugarcane producer. spends billions of dollars to subsidize its Sugar Program. Lets be clear: Removing the protections we have for our domestic sugar producers will do nothing but kill an American industry and outsource jobs to our competitors. Some have depicted the amendment of Senator SHAHEEN and TOOMEY as nothing more than a rollback of U.S. policy to the pre2008 policy. Lets be clear: The reason Congress modified the U.S. sugar policy in the 2008 farm bill was primarily because the provision in NAFTA. which allows subsidized Mexican sugar unfettered access to U.S. markets. kicked in in 2008. The reason the bill changed in 2008 is because the Sugar Program changed. Lets be clear: Eliminating or weakening the Sugar Program is going to kill rural jobs in America. I urge my colleagues to stand for agriculture and American jobs. I ask that my colleagues oppose the amendment of Senator SHAHEEN and Senator TOOMEY. I see the Senator from Illinois is here and about to join us on the floor.
1130041561,"Mr. President. I am glad the DOJ is going forward in pursuing this case. but as I said it is not enough. It is backwardlooking and addresses past harms. My concern is that the conduct continues to this day. The credit raters are still influenced by the relationships with the banks because that is who pays them. It is a clear conflict of interest. and we need to prioritize actions that will prevent another meltdown in the future. The DoddFrank provision I wrote with Senator WICKER. if implemented in full. would root out the conflicts of interest from the issuer pays model. The amendment we offered and the Senate passed directed the SEC. Securities and Exchange Commission. to create an independent selfregulatory organization that would select which agencyone with the adequate capacity and expertisewould provide the initial credit rating of each structured financial product. The assignments would not be based just on the agencys capacity and expertise but also. after time. on its track record. Our approach would incentivize and reward excellence. The current payforplay modelwith its inherent conflict of interestwould be replaced by a payfor performance model. This improved market finally allows smaller rating agencies to break the Big Threes oligopoly. The oligopoly is clear. The SEC estimates that as of December 31. 2011. approximately 91 percent of the credit ratings for structured finance products were issued by the three largest credit rating agenciesFitch. Moodys. and S&Peach of which was implicated in the PSI investigation. The other five agencies doing structured finance make up the remaining 9 percent. The current oligopoly does not incentivize accuracy. However. if we move to a system based on merit. the smaller credit rating agencies would be better able to participate and serve as a check against inflated ratings. thereby helping to prevent another meltdown. In our proposed model. the independent board would be comprised mainly of investor typesmanagers of university endowments and pension fundswho have the greatest stake in the reliability of credit ratings. as well as representatives from the credit rating agencies. the banking industries. and academics who have studied this issue. Our amendment passed the Senate with a large majority. including 11 Republican votes. This is not a progressive or conservative idea. it is a commonsense idea. The final version of DoddFrank modified the amendment and. to be frank. put more decisionmaking authority in the hands of the SEC as to how to respond to the problem of conflicts of interest in the credit rating agency industry. The final version directed the SEC to study the proposals that Senator WICKER and I made. along with other alternatives. and then decide how to act. The SEC released its study in December. The study acknowledged the conflicts of interest in the credit rating industry and reviewed our proposal and many of the alternatives. They laid out the pros and cons of each proposal without reaching a definitive conclusion on which route to pursue. The study also proposed holding a roundtable discussion to further examine reform opportunities. This SEC convened this roundtable on May 14. and both Senator WICKER and I had the opportunity to present opening remarks. Bloomberg News had a good article on the roundtable on March 14. including several key quotes that I am going to use in my remarks. The roundtable provided a rigorous examination of our proposal and of the alternatives. One executive who was from a smaller rating agency endorsed the concept of a rotating assignment system to help break up the current oligopoly. Jules Kroll. the CEO of Kroll Bonding Credit Agency. said of the Big Three: ""Theyre selling themselves out. just as they did before."" The Big Three were also represented at the roundtable. An S&P representative argued against meaningful reform by suggesting that ""a government assignment system could create uncertainty. could slow down markets. and disrupt capital flows at a time when we could least afford it."" He didnt mention puffery. Unsurprisingly. I disagree with his characterization and would indeed suggest that what we can least afford is to maintain the status quo. An alternative proposal. the continuation of the 17g5 proposal. was met with more than a little skepticism. The 17g5 Program seeks to encourage unpaid. unsolicited ratings by requiring the sharing of data on which ratings are based. The theory is. unsolicited ratings will keep paid ratings honest. Joseph Petro of Morningstar Credit Ratings said using the unsolicited rating program ""is not the best use of resources as were trying to build out our ratings platform."" SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes made a strong point when he noted that negative. unsolicited ratings by a firm ""may not be the best way to get business in an issuerpays setting."" By the time the report was written. the 17g5 Program had produced only one or two ratings. I have said all along that I believe the proposal of Senator WICKER and myself is a good one and the right one. and I continue to believe that more and more as I have thought about it and looked at it in the years now since we originally wrote the legislation. But I have also said I am open to any other meaningful proposals. and I will support any proposal the SEC recommends that addresses the conflicts of interest in a meaningful way. But the Roundtable made very clear once again that reform is necessary and that the status quo is inadequate to protect American investors. workers. and homeowners in the years ahead. Dealbreaker.com. a satirical blog that covers Wall Street. ran a post on the day of the SEC Roundtable with this title: ""The SEC Will Keep Talking About Credit Rating Agencies Until Everyone Stops Paying Attention."" That is one approach Wall Street regulators can choose to take and it would be completely unacceptable. To do that would be to fail the American people. Senator WICKER and I have worked with the SEC continuously over the past 3 years. and I will continue to pursue this issue until the SEC fulfills its directive to address the conflicts of interest in the credit rating industry. I am obligated to my constituents and to the American public to make sure that satirical headline does not become reality. I look forward to working with the SEC on the next steps toward a proposed rule on credit rating reform. I yield the floor. and I note the presence of both of my esteemed colleagues from Hawaii. including the one presiding. and Senator HIRONO. who is about. I believe. to ask for the floor."
1130053275,Mr. President. I rise today to speak about reopening the government. We are now 5 days into a government shutdown that should never have happened. Minnesotans do not want a government shutdown. They want us to do our jobs. not refight the same old political battles over and over. With each day of the shutdown I hear more and more reports about how it is affecting Minnesotans. as I am sure the Presiding Officer hears about how it is affecting the people of Maine. Minnesotans seeking basic government services are being turned away. Hundreds of people go to the Minneapolis Social Security office each day to get Social Security cards. But on the first day of the shutdown. according to the Minneapolis StarTribune. those Minnesotanssome of whom took time off from work and drove long distancesarrived to find the card center closed. Minnesotas small businesses are also feeling the impact. Small businesses in Minnesota receive an average of $1.8 million in loans every day under the Small Business Administrations Guaranteed Loan Programs in 2012. With the government shut down. these programs will no longer take new applications and our businesses have to put their plans on hold. It is not just businesses that are facing problems getting access to loans. Minnesota is home to a lot of great. smaller financial institutions. We have the second most community banks in the country. It is the home of a lot of credit unions. and I talk with them regularly. Earlier this week. I met with folks from some Minnesota credit unions. and they explained to me that as a result of the shutdown. they are having problems approving mortgages because the Social Security Administration cant verify Social Security numbers. That is not just bad for those Minnesotans who are trying to buy or sell a home. it is also bad for the economy. This week my office heard from one of those Minnesotans who is in the process of buying a home. Jesse is using a USDA Rural Development loan. His banker now has all of the documentation compiled and ready to be submitted to Rural Development for approval. but they are shut down. Jesse was originally supposed to close on October 11. next Friday. and the sellers were scheduled to close on another property right after closing on the property they are selling to Jesse. Jesse and his family are now living with his inlaws. and they have all of their possessions in storage. He doesnt know whether he will be able to close on his new homeall because some people thought it was a good idea to insist on shutting down the government to repeal the health care law. which isnt going to happen and never was going to happen. Jesse is really frustrated and disappointed. He felt compelled to let me know how this is affecting him and other people. He asked me to do whatever I could possibly do to end this shutdown quickly. The shutdown is also affecting other Minnesotans who depend on vital programs. such as Federal nutrition programs. An estimated 125.000 Minnesota mothers and motherstobe depend on the Women. Infants. and Children Program. or WIC. so they can buy healthy food for their families. With the shutdown no new Federal funds are available to support WIC. That puts the program in Minnesota. and the women and children it serves. at risk. Hopefully. we can avoid any terrible consequences by getting the government up and running as quickly as possible. But in some other States. such as Utahaccording to Forbesthey have already stopped accepting new participants. In a shutdown the Administration for Community Living in the Department of Health and Human Services cant fund senior nutrition programs such as Meals On Wheels. Seniors who rely on Meals On Wheels face uncertainty. If the shutdown goes on. State and local agencies will not be able to replace Federal funding and that will result in an outright inability to access the program. That is why I will be donating my salary during the shutdown to Second Harvest Heartland. It is a great hunger relief organization which works throughout Minnesota to help people who need to get food. Meanwhile. Minnesotas farmers cannot get the resources they need. Susan Magadenz. a constituent of mine from Eden Valley. MN. works at the USDA Farm Service Agency. She wrote me to say: This shutdown has cut off services to thousands of American farmers. They cannot get grain checks released and are missing access to funds they require to carry out their operation. The shutdown is hitting Minnesotans in many other ways as well. The shutdown means that the National Institutes of Health is not awarding any new funds or making payments on recently awarded grants. The Mayo Clinic receives 40 percent of its research funding from NIH grants. By the way. this is one of the many reasons we are going to have to address the sequester. This sequester has hit vital NIH funding really hard. even though this is an agency that some people seem not to have noticed until the shutdown. Speaking of the effects of the shutdown compounding the damage from the sequester. tribal schools are being hit even harder because they get a substantial part of their funding from the Federal Government in what is called Impact Aid. Impact Aid is Federal money that goes to school districts where Federal property or Federal activities significantly reduce the local tax base. The biggest recipients are the schools on military bases and on Indian reservations. We have 11 tribes in Minnesota. and some of them get about onethird of their school funding from the Federal Government. I am on the Indian Affairs Committee. and I can tell you that the sequestration has been hitting them even harder than it has been hitting other people. These are some of the most vulnerable kids in the country. Their afterschool programs are being canceled because of the sequester. And now. on top of that. Impact Aid is at even greater risk because of the shutdown. That is not right. It is just wrong. Some veterans services. through the Department of Veterans Affairs. are already being curtailed. and if the shutdown goes on for very much longer. VA will not be able to process benefit claims and payments. aggravating the claims backlog we have been working so hard to address. These are just some of the effects the shutdown is having on Minnesotans. People are suffering. Minnesotans who have written and called my office want Congress to get things done. do our work. and not shut down government. More than a week ago. I votedwith the Presiding Officer and a majority of my colleagues in the Senateto pass the bill to keep the government open and prevent the damage that a shutdown does to our country and to our economy. The House could take up that bill and pass it in a matter of hours. and it would reopen the government immediately. It has been widely reported that enough Republicans and Democrats support that bill for it to pass in the House if Speaker BOEHNER would only put it up for a vote in the House. That is all he needs to do. Let the full House vote on the continuing resolution. But the House hasnt done that. Instead. a faction of the Republicans in the House has decided that rehashing old political fights and political brinkmanship are more important than getting back to the job we were sent here to do. which is putting Americans back to work. improving education. and strengthening our economic recovery. Earlier this week I was asked what I would be working on if there were no shutdown. I would be working to pass my Community College to Career Fund Act. This legislation is aimed at closing what is called the skills gap. What is a skills gap? Recent studies in Minnesota show that about onethird to onehalf of all manufacturers in our State have jobs they need filled. but they cant fill them because they dont have people with the skills to fill them. There are more than 3 million of those jobs across the country that are going unfilled because of the lack of workers with the right skills. My bill would help those companies that have open positions. It would help workers find jobs. and it would help our country be more competitive globally. It would address college affordability. It is the kind of thing we need to be doing. I have seen partnerships between businesses and community colleges in Minnesota that workat Hennepin Technical College in Hennepin County. for example. A group of manufacturers worked with the school. Hennepin Technical College. and created a curriculum where students could get credentials. I went to a roundtable there and they told me they had put over 300 students through this course and 93 percent of them had permanent jobs. The manufacturers who are involved in this partnership had skin in the game. They gave Hennepin Tech machines and helped design the curriculum. Now they have people filling the jobs that need to be filled. I have seen this model work throughout Minnesota. and I have seen it work throughout our country. However. we still have a skills gap. That is why my bill would create a competitive grant program to incentivize partnerships between businesses and community colleges. This isnt just manufacturers. it is in health care. it is in IT. It would incentivize businesses and community colleges to create programs targeted at getting workers the skills they need to fill these jobs. This is what I want to be working on. This is what the Presiding Officer wants to be working on for the people of Maine. This is the kind of thing Americans sent us to do. Americans want us to learn from strategies that are succeeding in our Statesin Minnesota and in Maineand then work together to make our country more prosperous and stronger. What else are we supposed to do? That is why they sent us. I recognize we have political differences we have to work through. but brinkmanship and crises cant be the rule. they should be the exception. After the debt ceiling crisis in 2011. Standard & Poors downgraded our Nations credit rating and they cited the dysfunction in Congress as a main reason. After that. people thoughtI thought and I believe most people in this country thoughtOK. We have learned our lesson. We are not going to govern by crisis and brinkmanship. In fact. this year. in March. the Senate passed a budget through the regular process. through regular order. The House passed a budgeta different budget. but that is the way it worksand then we are supposed to get together for a conference. We have sought for months to have a conference with the House to resolve the differences in regular order. But we were blocked by the same Senators who thought it was a good idea to shut down the government and to defund the Affordable Care Act. The House has simply refused to go to conference. instead. they waited for the government shutdown and then sought to go to conference on a 212month continuing resolution that would delay the health care law for 1 year. That is irresponsible. Minnesotans and Americans want us to govern responsibly. Brenda Gregorich from Duluth wrote me on Wednesday about her husband. a disabled veteran whose disability benefit is now further delayed due to the shutdown. She says: We would rather do without. than have you give in to delaying the Affordable Care Act. Please stand strong and do not let anyone change or delay this. We will sit tight without income while you work towards this. Overwhelmingly. Americans do not want us to shut down the government to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Earlier this week. Minnesotas health care exchange opened and. according to Minnesota Public Radio. received approximately 100.000 Web hits on its first daythe second highest number of hits in any State. Believe me. we are not the second largest State. So the shutdown is not actually stopping the implementation of the health care law. instead. the shutdown is threatening to do serious damage to our economy. Today. jobless claims are close to a 5year low. The second quarter of 2013 marked nine consecutive quarters of economic growth. The private sector has created 7.5 million jobs over the last 42 months. There are more people on private. nonfarm payrolls than at any time since September of 2008. But the shutdown is putting our still fragile economic recovery in jeopardy. Moodys chief economist Mark Zandi testified before the Senate a few weeks ago that a shutdown lasting just a few days would cost the economy approximately 0.2 percent of GDP. and a longer shutdown could cost it as much as 1.4 percent. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has called on Congress to keep the government open stating: It is not in the best interest of the U.S. business community or the American people to risk even a brief government shutdown that might trigger disruptive consequences or raise new policy uncertainties washing over the U.S. economy. This shutdown is painful for our constituents and it is damaging the economy. Everyone should understand this is costing the government money. Some people may think at least if the government is shut down. we are saving money. But. actually. the very opposite is the case. Recently. in the New York Times. they had an editorial that detailed some of the reasons shutdowns end up being very expensive. A shutdown government cannot collect fines and fees. contractors build in the cost of the shutdown and the added probability of future shutdowns to how much they charge the government. Furloughing government workers means lost productivity. Lost economic output means lower tax revenue for Federal. State. and local governments. This shutdown is unnecessary and it is irrational. Please. lets reopen the government and get back to the work the people elected us to do. I thank the Chair.
1130059809,Mr. President. I rise today in strong support of the Employment NonDiscrimination Act. In many towns. cities. and States across our country. it is still perfectly legal to fire someone simply because they are gay. One can be a hard worker who shows up on time and gets exemplary performance reviews. but if a persons boss discovers that he or she is gay or transgender or suspects it. he can fire a person for being who they are or for whom they love. and there is nothing the person can do about it. That is a terrible injustice for Americans who happen to be LGBT. It violates the principle that we are all equal under the law. We all deserve the chance to work hard and to prove ourselves. regardless of our race. color. religion. sex. national origin. disability. age. sexual orientation. or gender identity. Many Americans do not realize it remains legal to discriminate against LGBT Americans in the workplace. In one recent poll. eight in ten Americans believe it is already illegal under Federal law to fire or refuse to hire someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Doesnt that tell us something about how obviously right ENDA is? The debate we are having in the Senate today is about whether we should ensure LGBT Americans dont suffer discrimination in the workplace. I have long been a supporter of ENDA. and enacting it into law is something we should have done a long time ago. In fact. 17 years ago. it came within one vote of passing in the Senate. Making ENDA law will be the next significant step in the fight for equality for LGBT Americans. After decades of struggle. we have achieved a number of huge victories in rapid succession: ending dont ask. dont tell. overturning the Federal ban on samesex marriage recognition. the achievement of marriage equality in more and more of our States. including my home State of Minnesota. While we are debating ENDA in the Senate today. equality in the workplace is. in fact. something we achieved in Minnesota over two decades ago. In 1993. the Minnesota State legislature amended our States human rights act to protect Minnesotas workers from discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. At the time only a few States prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. and Minnesota was the first State to include protections for transgender workers. We have had this law in effect now for over 20 years in Minnesota. and what has been the result? Well. for LGBT Minnesotans it has meant they do not have to live in fear of being fired or discriminated against in hiring just because of who they are or because of whom they love. That is a big deal. But if you are not an LGBT Minnesotan. very little has changed. Some people. including House Speaker BOEHNER. are opposing ENDA because they claim it will cause frivolous lawsuits and be bad for business. The Minnesota experience shows these fears are unfounded. There has not been a flood of lawsuits because the rights of LGBT Minnesotans are wisely respected. And with 19 Fortune 500 companies. Minnesota has become an ever better place to work and do business. Minnesota is basically the same as it was before this law was passed. except that it is better because LGBT Minnesotans are free from discrimination at work. Let me give you one example. Last year. a vice president from General Millsthe Minnesotabased company that is one of the worlds largest food companies and which currently employs 35.000 people and makes Cheeriosspoke at a Senate Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions Committee hearing about General Mills support for making sure that the same legal protections people have in Minnesota are extended to workers all across the United States. The General Mills vice president spoke about how the companys policy of inclusion has contributed to its innovation and growth. He said: Employees who are members of the GLBT community are incredible contributors to our enterprise. Absent their unique perspectives. talents. and gifts. we would be less competitive and successful. Simply said. talent matters. Now more than ever. American business needs to leverage the ingenuity of all sectors for our nation. Discriminatory barriers to top talent just dont make business sense. And there are many other large employers headquartered in MinnesotaTarget. Supervalu. U.S. Bancorp. Xcel Energy. Medtronic. 3M. Cargill. Best Buy. and many otherswho have put in place companywide policies against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation wherever their other factories or businesses or stores may be. Minnesotas small businesses have also reported on the positive effects of Minnesotas human rights law. For instance. Nancy Lyons is the owner of a small 70person Minneapolis business that develops software. Nancy says the protections and peace of mind her employees get from not living in fear positively impact every aspect of their lives. from their productivity at work to their family lives. It is long past time that LGBT employees around the country be guaranteed the same rights they have had in Minnesota for 20 years. In Minnesota. our law has given LGBT Minnesotans peace of mind and freedom from discrimination at work and improved the overall climate in our State for those individuals. for families. and for businesses. I look forward to the Senate passing this bill. and I hope the House will take it up and pass it as well. Thank you. Mr. President. I yield the floor.
1130069806,"Mr. President. I rise in support of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. I am pleased a 3month extension of unemployment insurance for millions in Minnesota and across the country was able to clear its first hurdle in the Senate. but our work of course is not finished. I urge my colleagues in the House and the Senate to pass an extension to renew these critical benefits so hardpressed families in Minnesota and across our Nation can keep their heads above water while they search for work. As I have traveled around Minnesota. I have heard from a lot of Minnesotans who wish to work. On Friday I had a roundtable conference. There were three women and some workforce professionals. These women are looking hard and have been looking. They are part of the longterm unemployed. These are women who were working: one is in her forties with two kidsone little kid. a 3yearold child. a single mom. one was in her fifties. and one was about my age. in her early sixties. While they are looking for jobsand we had a professional there who said one of the hardest jobs is looking for a job. They need the unemployment insurance to stay in their homes and to put food on the table for their families. In the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression. too many people had good jobs and worked their entire livesall of these women who had worked their entire lives had 20-. 30-. and 40year careers and now they are out of work and remain out of work. Unemployment remains high. and the longterm unemployment rate among workers who have been looking for work for at least 6 months has weighed down our economy. Today more then 4 million Americans. 37 percent of the unemployed. have been out of work for 6 months. This is the worst longterm unemployment since the Great Recession. That is why we need to extend the emergency unemployment compensation. These workers. the millions throughout the country. are worried they will lose their ability to pay for a roof over their heads and put food on the table for their families. for their children. For most Americans. Statefunded unemployment insurance runs out after 26 weeks. Yet the average unemployment spell now lasts over 21/2 months longer. Emergency unemployment benefits provide for up to an additional 47 weeks of unemployment insurance for those Americans who need it while they are looking for a job. When I talk about high longterm employment. these women. every one of them I talked to. were working very hard every day. One woman described it as saying: I am looking 24 hours a day. I have my smartphone. and I am hoping 24 hours a day that I get something. a response. an interview. Right now we have three people looking for every job opening. but that doesnt mean that when someone applies for a job. there are only two other people looking. These women were telling me every time they applied for a job there were several hundred people looking. Very often they will apply for a job that a company announces. and the company will hire someone from inside the company. which is great for that person. But this is not about people waiting for their unemployment to run out and then look for a job. That is not what it is about. After Christmas. 1.3 million Americans lost their jobs and who are looking for work. including 8.500 Minnesotans. They lost this critical lifeline of unemployment compensation. Remember. these women I talked about paid in. I am talking about 20 years of working. 30 years of working. 40 years in the workforce. If we dont renew these benefits over the next year. that lifeline will run out for another 3.6 million people. including 65.000plus Minnesotans. While Minnesota has been fortunate to have a lower unemployment rate than other States. I believe the 65.000 Minnesotans who will lose benefits without an extension deserve our support as they are looking for work. Congress has never allowed special extended unemployment benefits to expire when the longterm unemployment rate is as high as it is today. In fact. at 2.5 percent. the longterm unemployment rate is nearly double the level when previous emergency benefits were allowed to expire. The current unemployment rate of 6.7 percent is far above nearly all previous rates seen at expiration and is 1.1 percent higher than when President George W. Bush signed the current round of benefits into law. As I said. on Friday I met with several unemployed Minnesotans. Two out of the three were affected by our not extending the emergency unemployment insurance. I wish to share a little bit of their stories but also people who have written in. Minnesotans who have reached out to me about how failing to extend unemployment insurance will affect them. John from Cushing. MN. wrote in December: I am a 58 year old sales and marketing professional that was laid off due to a force reduction and have been unemployed for a year. I have not been able to find even part time work. I have exhausted my severance package and most of my liquid savings just to cover financial obligations and essentials such as food and utilities. Additionally. I do not have any health care coverage as my income has been limited to unemployment compensation. Now that the Federal Extension is about to expire. beginning next week I will have zero income and no job offer pending. I would appreciate your support in doing what you can to reinstate the Federal Unemployment Extension in Minnesota as for me personally. it is of extreme need and I would expect many others around the country may also be in such dire straits. Almost halfI believe it is the majority of Americanssometime in their lives hit a hard patch and our job is to be there for them. Debbie from White Bear Lake wrote: There are many of us out here who will run out of benefits next year and are still unable to find a decent job. I have been out of work for over 4 months and am spending at least 56 hours a day (EVERY day) looking for a job. While this may not seem that long. I am already concerned about my state unemployment running out and having nothing ... The people that actually work are the ones that spend money to help the economy. She is right. We know from CBO that if we extend unemployment insurance these people spend the money and it goes immediately out in the economy and actually the CBO says this will sustain about 200.000 additional jobs. If we dont do this. we will create 200.000 less jobs over the next year. On Friday I met with Ann from Eden Prairie. who wrote: I have unfortunately been unemployed since being downsized from a small consulting organization in April. 2013. . . . I have been extremely active in my job search Boy. has she. I will say all of these women were upgrading their skills. Some of them had gone back to school to upgrade their skills and are still not being successful in finding work. She continues: -but have regrettably not found new unemployment. My Minnesota Unemployment Insurance ran out last week and I applied for Federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation just this past week. I understand its going to expire at the end of the month. She wrote to me in December. I ask you to please ask yourself what you would do to provide for your family. I have a 9 year old daughter . . . and a three year old son. I am the sole provider for my family. I volunteer extensively at the school and elsewhere in my community ... She is a volunteer. She does that. but she also volunteers looking for a job. She is networking in her volunteer work. She is volunteering for her kids school. for her 9yearolds school. She told me the 3yearold went to preschool 5 days a week. then 4 days. then 3 days. then 2 days. and now 1 day a weekand how hard is it to look for a job with a 3yearold. She continues: ""I am not looking for a handout. nor do I believe that staying on unemployment insurance is in my best interest."" But she says it ""will at least allow me to make my mortgage payment."" Doug. from Bloomington. wrote that he and his family will lose their home if we allow benefits to expire. He says: I unfortunately lost my job due to the economy last March . . . each position that I apply for has at least 500 candidates applying for the same position. If the Federal unemployment extension is not approved. my family and I will be homeless within a month! I have even tried to apply for ""temporary positions."" however. they always reply that I am overly qualified! We talked about this in the roundtable. We also had professionals there who are professional workforce people and are counselors. These people are working it. There was a woman in her fifties who said: They will not take me at McDonalds because they figure if I get some other job I will leave and it costs to train them. It truly troubles me that those who have worked and contributed to our society the longest. I am saying 20. 30. 40 years. have been particularly hit hard by longterm unemployment. in other words. older workers who lose their jobs have experienced longer periods of unemployment than younger workers. Part of that is age discrimination. That age discrimination has made it more difficult for older workers to bounce back when they lose their jobs. According to AARP. 34 percent of older workers seeking work reported they had experienced. or know someone who has experienced. age discrimination in the past 4 years. This was the experience of all three of the women I talked to. Extending unemployment insurance isnt just the right thing to do to help our fellow Americans who are out of work and searching for a job. it is also the smart thing to do for our economy. As I said. in 2011. the Congressional Budget Office said that aid to the unemployed is among the policies with ""the largest effects on output and employment per dollar of budgetary cost."" CBO estimates that extending benefits through 2014 will help expand the economy and contribute to the creation of an additional 200.000 jobs. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates without a fullyear extension. the economy will generate 240.000 fewer jobs by the end of 2014. We know unemployment benefits work. The Census Bureau estimates that unemployment benefits kept 2.5 million people who are trying to stay in the workforce out of poverty in 2012 alone and have kept over 11 million unemployed workers out of poverty since 2008. Countless local businesses feel the positive effects when the unemployed are able to keep buying their basic necessitiesfood. utilities. gas. so they can drive to look for a job. Unemployment insurance isnt the only thing we should be doing to help the unemployed either. There are lots of things we can and should be doing. There are more than 3 million jobs in this country that could be filled today if there were workers who had the right skills. With too many Americans unemployed. we have to find a way to fill those jobs. to train those workers. We should be helping workers get the training they need to fill the hightech jobs that are growing in Minnesota and across the countryin Maine. in Alabama. in the State of every Senator I talk to in this Chamber when I talk about the skills gap and manufacturing returning to this countrybut we dont have the skilled workers. and this at a time of such high longterm unemployment. We need to be training a workforce for the 21st century. Sometimes these jobs are in advanced manufacturing. Sometimes this training takes 2 years. but we need to do it. We should be helping connect these people to educational programs that link them with employers. and that is why I have introduced the Community College to Career Fund Act. Under this program. businesses and community colleges would apply for grants based on how many jobs that partnership would create. the value of the jobs to those hired and to the community. and how much skin the businesses have in the game. There is a lot we should be doing to create jobs. We should be addressing our infrastructure deficit. You know. when you dont repair our infrastructure. when you dont create new infrastructure. that is a deficit too. and we need to get people into work that we need to be doing. But failing to extend emergency unemployment doesnt make sense. We shouldnt be punishing people such as John and Debbie and Ann and Doug who are looking for work and cant find jobs. We shouldnt be pulling the rug out from under them and millions of others who support the small businesses and local retailers in our cities and our towns. Extending these benefits is something we should do now to jumpstart and to continue this recovery. But we shouldnt stop there. I will continue to press this Congress to work to create jobs through investments in infrastructure. in innovation and education so that the unemployed can get back to work at good jobs that sustain longterm economic growth. Mr. President. I yield the floor."
1130073536,Mr. President. I am very pleased that we were able to vote on and pass a badly needed and longoverdue 5year farm bill today and that we are finally on the verge of enacting the legislation into law with the Presidents signature. With one in five jobs in Minnesota connected to agriculture. passing this bill has been a top priority of mine. I have been working on it for over 21/2 years. along with a large number of my colleagues. and I have gone all around Minnesota talking to farmers and businesses. They tell me not only did they want a 5year farm bill. but they needed a 5year farm bill so they could plan for the future. Well. we finally have gotten it done. There are so many important pieces to this bill. and I want to speak about a few of them today. When I meet with farm leaders and visit farms all across Minnesota. I hear over and over about the importance of providing farmers with a strong safety net. There is a lot of uncertainty when it comes to farming. Once a farmer puts his crop into the ground. the crops are vulnerable to drought. to too much rain. to disease. and different kinds of pests and to other natural disasters. In 2012. for example. we witnessed a terrible drought that devastated the Nations corn and soybean crops and forced ranchers to cull their livestock. All of these safety net programs in the bill are important because they protect our farmers and ranchers. and they also protect American consumers by making sure families have a reliable. domestically produced supply of food. The bill provides disaster assurances for livestock producers. It contains a dairy program so our dairy producers have the certainty they need. It contains a sugar program to help protect our sugar growers. American sugar growers. Minnesota is home to a large number of beet sugar growers. and the sugar industry provides thousands of goodpaying jobs. American jobs. and billions of dollars to the economy of our region. I fought to make sure we kept this vital program in place. This bill also includes crop insurance so farmers have certainty with respect to their planting decisions. One of the things the farm bill does. which was very important to me and to so many people. is to link the crop insurance program to conservation. Minnesota farmers are good stewards of the land and understand how critical conservation is. and so do our hunters and our anglers. With this provision in the farm bill. when our farmers receive the crop insurance benefits. they also agree to implement conservation practices that are good for our land and for our water. In addition to a strong safety net in the conservation provisions. the bill also contains many provisions that are very important to Minnesota agriculture. For example. I pushed to include provisions to support beginning farmers. With the average age of farmers in Minnesota approaching 60. we need to invest in a new generation of farmers and ranchers. That is why the beginning farmer and rancher program has been a priority of mine. This important program will support training and education for beginning farmers. and it will help new farmers overcome the steep financial hurdles they often face when starting. I am also very proud of the comprehensive energy title of the bill. which I helped to author. The energy sector in agriculture produces jobs and supports rural communities in Minnesota and across the country. The energy title includes programs such as the Rural Energy for America Programor REAPwhich provides farmers and rural business services with loans and grants so they can invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy to reduce their energy bills. It also includes programs to help rural America develop advanced biofuels that will help wean the Nation off of foreign oil. It also includes programs to help move the Nation away from a foreign petroleum economy. the way products are increasingly made out of homegrown renewable biomass. Those are only some of what I fought for in the bill. The bill does all of these critically important things while also reducing the deficit by billions of dollars. Like all bipartisan compromises. the bill is not perfect. In particular. I am not happy with the cuts to the nutrition program on which so many lowincome families rely. I am somewhat relieved in the end these cuts were closer to what was in the original Senate bill than the draconian cuts the House of Representatives had called for and passed in their bill. I appreciate the tough job. though. my colleagues had on their hands to arrive at a final compromise. At the end of the day. this is an incredibly important piece of legislation that I and many colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been working to get over the finish line. I am pleased we have finally come together to pass a bipartisan 5year farm bill that will make needed reforms and give farmers the certainty they need to plan for the future. The bill we passed will not only support rural America but our entire Nation. I yield the floor.
1130117302,Mr. President. I thank the generous Senator from Michigan. and I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her remarks about the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. I have held college affordability roundtables around my State of Minnesota ever since I got to the Senate. It is astounding how hard students work while they are also in college. I remember speaking to the student governing body from MnSCUthe Minnesota colleges and universities student bodyand I asked: How many of you work 20 hours a week? They all raised their hands. They were in the governing body. I said: How many of you work 30 hours a week? A few raised their hands. I said: How many of you work 40 hours a week? A couple raised their hands. These students work while going to college. In Minnesota students graduate with more than $30.000 in student loan debt. We are about fourth in the Nation. I heard Senator SHAHEEN say they are second in the Nation. This bill would help over 550.000 Minnesotans and 25 million Americans cut down their debt and keep more of their hardearned checks. A few months ago I had a roundtable at the University of Minnesota. and I met Joelle Stangler. She happened to be the student body president at the University of Minnesota. She was the valedictorian of Rogers High School in Minnesota with a 4.12 GPA. She doesnt lack motivation. Both of Joelles parents were teachers. In fact. she comes from a long line of educators going back six generations. You will see why I am telling this story. A couple of years ago Joelles mother Cassie Stangler made the tough decision to quit her job as a fifth grade teacher to go to work in the private sector because she could make more money in the private sector. She needed to do this because she had four kids in college. Among the fifth grade classes in Mrs. Stanglers school district. her students showed some of the highest rates of improvement in test scores. This is what I am talking aboutwe lost a great teacher because of the expense of postsecondary education. Even with her moms sacrifice. she has $12.000 in student loans. and she estimates that her total debt will be around $30.000 by the time she graduates. There are so many students such as Joelle who are drowning in debt in Minnesota and across the country. Student debt totals are over $1.2 trillion. and it is a threat to our economy. We are seeing young people delay decisions to start a business. to start a family. to buy a home. or make other types of purchases that make an economy grow. But there are commonsense solutions. and they are contained in our Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. Our bill simply allows students and graduates to take advantage of lower interest rates and refinance their loans. That is what people with mortgages. car loans. and business loans can do. They can take advantage of lower interest rates and refinance their loans. but the government will not refinance student loans. and that is just not right. In the summer of 2013 we came together in Congress to prevent the interest rate on new student loans from doubling. Thanks to that effort. undergraduate students taking out new loans now pay a lower rate. Our bill would enable students and graduates who are saddled with higher interest rates on their undergraduate loans to refinance at the same lower interest rate. The bill would similarly enable Americans with graduate student loans or PLUS loans to refinance at lower rates. Student debt is holding Americans back. it is holding back our economy. and that is why we need to pass this bill. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield to the Senator from Michigan.

1130015014,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I first just want to dedicate a moment or two to our fellow citizens up in Boston who are going through some very traumatic times right now. The fact that bombs have gone off in Boston. that sadly there have been fatalities and sadly many people have been injured. our prayers go out to our fellow citizens. to the first responders. and we pray that this matter will be resolved in a way that brings anybody who brings harm to anyone to justice. With that. Mr. Speaker. on the subject of the bill. I rise in strong support of this bill. I want to associate myself with the words of our chairman. Mr. ISSA. This is truly indeed a bipartisan bill. As to the contents of the bill. GAO assists Congress in identifying waste. fraud. and abuse in Federal programs and recommending ways to make government work better. Because of its vital role. GAO needs unfetterred access to Federal agencies. Efforts by executive branch officials to withhold information from GAO unfortunately impede Congress ability to legislate effectively. And I will say it over and over again. as long as I live. we need to be effective and efficient in everything we do on this Earth. This is an effort to make sure that we can be just that. more effective and efficient. The Government Accountability Office Improvement Act will increase the effectiveness of GAO by clarifying and strengthening its authority in several critical areas. including access to records. The GAO Improvement Act addresses a Federal court decision in Walker v. Cheney that limited GAOs ability to question agency access determinations in court. The bill provides the Comptroller General. with express authority from Congress. to pursue litigation if the Comptroller General determines that the performance of her official duties is harmed when an agency improperly withholds information. The bill also clarifies GAOs access to information in other key areas by confirming GAOs right to make and retain copies of records. authorizing the GAO to administer oaths in certain circumstances and specifically granting GAO access to certain information. Finally. Mr. Speaker. the bill creates a reporting mechanism so that Congress will be more fully informed when agencies do not cooperate with GAO. I introduced similar legislation to this bill in the last Congress which passed the House as a provision of H.R. 2146. the DATA Act. to which it was added at my request. Again. I want to thank the chairman of the committee for his cooperation in getting the bill to the floor. and I urge Members to pass H.R. 1162. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130015062,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As one who represents many Federal employees. with the Social Security Administration smack dab in the middle of my district. with many of my constituents getting up at 4 oclock in the morning. catching the train over here from Howard County and Baltimore County to work for the Federal Government. a group of people. many of whom are being subjected now to furloughs. have been subjected to pay freezes. in some instances have been placed in a position where they have to pay more toward their pensions and get less. a group of people who in many instances I run into them at the gas station. at the Pancake House. or wherever I may see them. who are very much concerned about a word that has become a significant word in this House. ""uncertainty."" I strongly oppose H.R. 249. a measure that would require the Federal Government to fireto fireFederal employees who have an outstanding tax debt. The legislation is unwarranted. unnecessary and. in fact. counterproductive. I believe that Federal employees. like all Americans. should pay their taxes. and I dont think that theres one single Member of this Congress that feels otherwise. We all believe that Federal employees and all folks who owe taxes ought to pay them. Federal workers hold the public trust and should be held to a high standard of conduct. The fact is that Federal employees have met and exceeded that standard. The legislation is unwarranted because the tax delinquency rate for Federal employees is less than half that of the general public. In 2011. the tax delinquency rate for the general public was 8.2 percent. In the same year. the tax delinquency rate for Federal workers was only 3.62 percent. Now. let me make it clear: I would suggest that it would be bestand wonderfulif that percentage was zero. but its not. But again. the general delinquency rate. 8.2 percent. Federal workers. 3.62 percent. The legislation is unnecessary because the IRS and other executive agencies already have procedures in place to recover back taxes from Federal employees. Through the Federal Payment and Levy Program. the IRS can impose a continuous levy on Federal salaries and annuities up to 15 percent until the debt is paid. Agencies also have the authority to take disciplinary action against employees for delinquent tax debts. which may include removal. if necessary. The legislation is counterproductive because it would make it more difficult to collect unpaid taxes from Federal employees by requiring their termination and eliminating the ability to impose levies on their salaries. On another note. I just left. about 3 hours ago. a job fair that I sponsored in my district where 9.000 unemployed people showed up. In talking to some of the various agencies. they said. Congressman CUMMINGS. were glad that the State of Maryland is now dealing with child support issues a little bit differently because we used to take everybodys license. We would make it almost impossible for them to make money so that they could pay the child support. They said now were beginning to turn some of those laws around because. again. we want to be effective and efficient in collecting the money. Here. if a person has no job. how are they going to pay their taxes? I am also concerned that this legislation is being rushed to the floor today to apparently make a political point. During committee debate over the legislation. questions were raised. To his credit. the chairman agreed that we would try to get some responses from the IRS about the rules and procedures regarding debt collection. options for resolving delinquencies. payment options. tax delinquencies of IRS employees. and other issues. The chairman promised to obtain the answers to these questions from the IRS and to work with Democrats before the bill was brought to the floor. Now. I have absolutely no doubt that the IRS failed to do what they were supposed to do. they did not give us the information. But there was a reason that we wanted that information. We wanted the information so that we could base our decisions on sound facts. If we are placing people in a position where they will lose their way of feeding their family and having a roof over their head and taking care of their kids. it would be nice to have information. I tell my staff all the time: Give me the information so that I can make a decent decision. We dont have that information. and that is unfortunate. Hopefully. at some point. we will get it from the IRS. Again. Mr. Speaker. I dont blame the chairman. He did his part. He submitted his letter. I know he did. but we still have not heard from the IRS. So on April 4. 2013. I joined with Chairman ISSA in sending that letter to the IRS. requesting specific information that the committee members agreed was necessary to fairly and fully evaluate the need for this legislation. Again. without this information. it is unclear whether various scenarios under which taxpayer disputes of tax debt would be exempted under the bill. For example. it is unclear whether an appeal from a collection due process hearing. litigation proceedings in U.S. Tax Court. or hearings under the IRS Collection Appeals Program would trigger an exemption. Contrary to the chairmans assurances. the Republican leadership has insisted on bringing this bill to the floor without the benefit of this information and without resolving the many concerns raised during the committee debate. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this bill. Again. we need information. but more importantly. there is something that the chairman said that I think we need to be clear on. I want to see. again. a situation where everybody pays every dime that they are supposed to pay. but I dont think that people get fired if theyre not Federal employees when they have a tax delinquency. So when were talking about fairness. again. were talking about the Federal employee. and then were talking about everybody else. So with that. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130048572,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I was the chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee in 2008 when Congress last rejected the measure before us today. and there has been no change in the intervening years that would now make this measure good policy. H.R. 1961 is a bill that would amend Federal law for the benefit of one single vessel. the Delta Queen. As such. I think we should call this bill what it really is: its an earmark. Let me say that again: its an earmark. And what would this earmark do? First. it would create a potential fire trap on the water. In 1936. the United States required all passenger vessels to be constructed of fireretardant materials. The Delta Queen was built in 1926. and part of its construction occurred in Europe. Its superstructure is wooden and not flame retardant. Exempting the Delta Queen from current fire safety standards would present an unacceptable and. frankly. unnecessary risk to passenger safety. When this issue was last considered. the Coast Guard stated the following: The combustible construction of the vessel presents an unacceptable fire risk that cannot be mitigated by the addition of fire suppression measures. Just yesterday. I talked to Rear Admiral Joseph Servidio. the Coast Guards assistant commandant for prevention policy. He oversees vessel inspections. and he made it clear to me that the Coast Guard continues to oppose this waiver. He also made it clear that a number of safety concerns may persist from the Coast Guards 2008 special inspection of the Delta Queen. And. frankly. the exemption this legislation seeks to make is not needed for the Delta Queen to operate on the Mississippi again if it wanted to do so. Let me say that again: the Delta Queen does not need the exemption that would be provided by this bill to operate in U.S. waters. The Delta Queen could take passengers on day cruises. and it could host up to 49 overnight passengers right now. But under current law. it cannot host 50 or more overnight passengers. The only thing the exemption sought in H.R. 1961 would do is increase the number of overnight passengers the Delta Queen could carry along our Nations waterways. thus increasing the number of passengers who would be at risk should a fire break out on the boat. What else would this earmark do? This earmark would interfere in a competitive market to pick winners and losers by giving an advantage to one vessel. something I thought my friends on the other side of the aisle said Congress should not be in the business of doing. Today. the Queen of the Mississippi. a boat built in 2012 in the United States is in compliance with all applicable safety standards. is operating on a Mississippi River system. And another boat that will comply with current safety standards is under construction here in the United States. But if H.R. 1961 were to pass. these Americanbuilt boats. safetycompliant vessels. would have to compete with a vessel that would not have to meet the same safety standards required of all other vessels. So not only would the earmark before us create an unsafe situation. but it would also create an unfair situation. Rather than creating an unnecessary safety hazard. and rather than picking winners and losers. I urge my colleagues to reject this earmark. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130069013,Mr. Speaker. I thank the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey for yielding. I would like to make two very. very simple points. First. the Affordable Care Act is working. Hello. It is working. It went into full effect. if you didnt know. on January 1. and now millions of peoplemillionsare getting health insurance that they didnt have before. Imagine what this means to families. Not only are they receiving critical medical care. but they have the security of knowing they will not go bankrupt if they get into an accident or they get sick. That is major. The law also put in place key protections for consumers. Insurance companies are now prohibited from discriminating against people with cancer. diabetes. or other preexisting conditions. Some young people in my district said. Well. Congressman. I am not worried about preexisting conditions. I told them. You just keep on living. Insurance companies may not charge higher prices for women. and millions of people are now receiving free preventative care. There are also huge financial benefits. Health insurance companies are sending rebate checks to millions of people. Since the law was passed. we have seen the lowest growth in health care costs in 50 years. and if we repealed the law today. it would increase our deficit by more than $1.5 trillion. Despite all these positive results. Republicans are still obsessed with killing the law. Since they cannot do it legislatively. they have shifted to a different tacticscaring people away from the Web site. So my second point is this. There have been no successful security breaches of www.healthcare.gov. Let me say that again. There have been no successful security breaches of www.healthcare.gov. Nobodys personal information has been maliciously hacked. All week. Republicans have been trying to make their case for this bill by quoting from a memo drafted by the chief information security officer at CMS about concerns before the Web site was launched. but they omit one critical fact: this official never sent the memo. It was a draft. And she never gave it to anyone. including her own supervisor. How do we know this? Because she was interviewed by the Oversight Committee by both Republican and Democratic staff weeks ago.
1130070045,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all. I want to begin by thanking Chairman ISSA for supporting this legislation and for making this a bipartisan effort. The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments is aimed at giving the American people access to the records Presidents create while they are in office. Under the Presidential Records Act. a President has discretion to restrict access to his records for up to 12 years after he leaves office. After that time. a President can continue to restrict access to his records by arguing that the records are protected by executive privilege. The Presidential Records Act does not currently include guidelines for the consideration of Presidential privilege claims. This bill would amend the law by adding procedures to ensure the timely release of Presidential records. Under the bill. current and former Presidents would have up to 90 days to object to release of records or those records would be released. The Presidential and Federal Records Act also would require that any assertion of privilege by a former President be affirmed by the incumbent President or through a court order. The bill we are considering today also makes clear that the right to assert the privilege is personal to current and former Presidents. and that they not be bequeathed to assistants. relatives. or decedents. Putting this language into statute will ensure that future Presidents are held to the standard first set by President Reagan. The chairman of the Oversight Committee. Representative DARRELL ISSA. added an amendment during the committee markup of the bill to address the use of personal email by Federal employees. There is nothing currently in the Presidential Records Act or the Federal Records Act that prohibits employees from using personal email accounts to conduct official business. These acts simply require preservation of these records. This bill will continue to allow employees to use their personal email account when necessary. but it would require employees to copy their official email account or forward their email to their official account. This is a good government bill. Similar versions of this bill overwhelmingly passed the House in two previous Congresses. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1233 so the Senate can take it up quickly and so that it might be sent on to the President for his signature. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130076228,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize National Childrens Dental Health Month. It is a critical part of overall health. yet it is also an issue frequently overlooked. Too often we think of dental care as an optional service. but in reality. it is a critical component of overall health. Its importance first hit home for me 7 years ago when I learned the story of a young Maryland boy named Deamonte Driver. In February of 2007. 12yearold Deamonte came from school with a headache. which had started as a toothache days before. His mother. who worked hard to make ends meet with lowpaying jobs. searched for a dentist who would accept Medicaid for her children. She found not one dentist. Let me say that again. She found not one single dentist who would care for her childrens teeth. At wits end. Deamontes mother brought him to the emergency room. where he received medication for pain. a sinus infection. and a dental abscess. Unfortunately. that was not enough. The bacteria from Deamontes cavity spread to his brain. and at 12 years old. he died for lack of a simple procedure early on to remove a tooth. He died less than 20 minutes away from where we stand today. Deamontes case served as a jarring lesson on the lack of access to care for many families. At the time of Deamontes death. fewer than one in three children under the age of 20 in Marylands Medicaid program received any dental service at all. In the years since. with the passage of the Affordable Care Act and new efforts to ensure a healthier America. we made significant progress in Maryland and across the country. In other words. we have changed the trajectory of so many childrens destinies. Now. 52 percent of children on Medicaid in Maryland receive dental services. even as the number of children enrolled has increased by 25 percent. In fact. through the work of government officials in Marylands Dental Action Coalition. the State has led the way in increasing access for dental care for children. Nationally. the number of children enrolled in Medicaid who received dental care in 2010 jumped to 46 percent. numbers that suggest progress. but also signal the work left to be accomplished. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act has made a difference. allowing millions more children to receive critical medical and dental care right now. Even more children could access these services if Republican Governors in some States reverse their decisions to block the expansion of Medicaid. I have often said that our children are the living messages we send to a future we will never see. Yet. even with the improvements we have seen. more must be done to ensure that both children and adults have access to needed treatment and preventive care. That is why I introduced the Comprehensive Dental Reform Act. My legislation would provide funding to improve access to dental care through health clinics. schoolbased services. and other options for underserved populations. extend comprehensive dental coverage to Americans on Medicare. Medicaid. and VA benefits. increase the number of oral health professionals in communities in need. help support research and education to better integrate oral health with regular care. We have come a long way. but more must be done to protect the dental health of our children and every American. If we can assure no child loses his or her life because a dentist couldnt be found to pull a tooth. Deamontes death wont be in vain.
1130076918,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to H.R. 899. the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act. This bill is the second major piece of legislation being considered this week that will add needless and counterproductive red tape to the rulemaking process. I have the privilege of serving as the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Oversight Committee has jurisdiction over the executive branch and legislative jurisdiction over governmentwide policies. It is our duty and our responsibility to ensure that the Federal Government is operating effectively and efficiently. It is also the responsibility of every Member of Congress. and we must hold that dearly. This legislation may be wellintended. but it would have unintended consequences that would make government less efficient and less effective. We rely on agency rulemakings to protect our children. protect our workers. and protect our economy. The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards. a group of more than 150 good government. labor. scientific. faith. health. and community organizations. sent a letter to the Oversight Committee. Here is just a portion of what that letter said: The Wall Street economic collapse. the British Petroleum oil spill catastrophe. various food and product safety recalls. and numerous industrial disasters. including the Upper Big Branch mine explosion in West Virginia and the fertilizer plant in West. Texas. have all dramatically demonstrated the need for a stronger regulatory system that is more responsive to the public interest. Congress should be moving forward to protect the public from harm. not rolling back the clock and weakening important safeguards. Mr. Chairman. now is not the time for us to be adding unnecessary. burdensome requirements to the rulemaking process. Our constituents expect us to make them safer. not to make it harder for agencies to keep them safe. The bill would give private industry an unfair advantage in the rulemaking process. Under this bill. agencies would be required to consult with corporations before consulting with customers who would be protected by the regulations. In fact. the bill requires agencies to consult with private industry ""before issuance of a proposed rulemaking."" This means that. for example. if the Department of Agriculture planned to propose a new food safety rule. corporate agricultural interests would get advance access to the rule. and the opportunity to shape it. before food safety groups. childrens health groups. doctors. or independent scientists are able to participate in the process. I believe that businesses should have the opportunity to provide comments on proposed rules. I think it is very important. They should do it through the normal public comment process. however. just like other stakeholders. The bill also would put independent agencies in jeopardy of political interference. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act currently exempts independent agencies from its reporting requirements. This bill removes that exemption. That would mean that independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission would have to submit their rules to the Office of Management and Budget for review. which could undermine their independence. I plan to offer an amendment to strike that provision. and I hope it will be adopted. This is a wellintended bill with serious. negative consequences. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130090086,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Just shy of 1 year ago. the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported the IRS had used inappropriate criteria to review applicants for taxexempt status. The very same day. Chairman ISSA went on national TV. before he received a single document or interviewed a single witness. and said the following: ""This was the targeting of the Presidents political enemies effectively. and lies about it during the election year."" Republicans have spent the past year trying to prove these allegations. The IRS has spent more than $14 million responding to Congress and has produced more than a half a million pages of documents. We have interviewed 39 witnesses. 40 witnesses. IRS witnesses. Treasury Department employees. and after all of that. we have not found any evidence of White House involvement or political motivation. Yesterday. I issued a report with key portions from the nearly 40 interviews conducted by the committee to date. and these were witnesses. Mr. Speaker. called by the majority. These interviews showed. definitively. that there was no evidence of any White House direction or political bias. instead they describe in detail how the inappropriate terms were first developed and how there was inadequate guidance on how to process the application. Now. let me be clear that I am not defending Ms. Lerner. I wanted to hear what she had to say. I have questions about why she was unaware of the inappropriate criteria for more than a year after they were created. I want to know why she did not mention the inappropriate criteria in her letters to Congress. but I could not vote to violate an individuals Fifth Amendment rights. just because I want to hear what she has to say. A much greater principle is at stake here today. the sanctity of the Fifth Amendment rights for all citizens of the United States of America. and I will not walk a path that has been tread by Senator McCarthy and the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. In this case. a vote for contempt not only would endanger the rights of American citizens. but it would be a pointless and costly exercise. When Senator McCarthy pursued a similar case. the judge dismissed it. The Supreme Court has said that a witness does not waive her rights by professing her innocence. In addition. more than 30 independent experts have now come forward to conclude that Chairman ISSA botched the contempt procedure by not giving Ms. Lerner the proper warnings at the March 5 hearing. when he rushed to cut off my microphone and adjourn the hearing before any Democrat had the chance to utter a syllable. For instance. Stan Brand. who served as the House Counsel from 1976 to 1983. concluded that Chairman ISSAs actions were ""fatal to any subsequent prosecution."" The experts who came forward are from all across the country and all across the political spectrum. J. Richard Broughton. a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association and a law professor. concluded that Ms. Lerner ""would likely have a defense to any ensuing criminal prosecution for contempt pursuant to the existing Supreme Court precedent."" I didnt say that. The Republican National Lawyers Association member said that. Rather than squandering our valuable resources. pursuing a contempt vote that more than 30 independent experts have concluded will fail in court. we should release the nearly 40 transcripts. in their entirety. that have not yet been made public and allow all Americans to read the unvarnished facts for themselves. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130090736,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. and I rise in strong opposition to this resolution. Benghazi was a tragedy. We lost four brave Americans that night. and I extend my deepest sympathies to their families. In my opinion. we honor their memories best by bringing their killers to justice and by working in a bipartisan way to strengthen security for all U.S. personal overseas. As family members of Ambassador Stevens have stated. ""What Chris never would have accepted was the idea that his death would have been used for political purposes."" Unfortunately. that is what House Republicans have been doing for the last year and a half. On April 23. 2013. the Republican chairmen of five different House committees issued a highly partisan staff report with absolutely no consultation or input from a single Democratic Member of the Congress of the United States of America. Their report included a reckless accusation that Secretary Clinton personally authorized security reductions in Benghazi. Chairman ISSA then went on national television and said. Secretary Clinton ""outright denied security. in her signature. in a cable."" When we located the cable. however. we discovered that the Republican report distorted the facts. The cable had only a printed stamp of Secretary Clintons name. the same stamp that appears on hundreds of thousands of cables sent from the State Department every year. This report was issued under the direction of the Speaker. It was posted on his Web site. and it was prepared only for Members of the House Republican Conference. How is this a bipartisan search for the truth? House Republicans have also excluded Democratic Members from factfinding delegations to Libya. in violation of the rules issued by the Speaker. How is that bipartisan? Democratic Members have been denied equal access to witnesses. and Republicans have selectively leaked documents and cherrypicked transcript excerpts without any official committee consideration. How is that bipartisan? Republicans have also been doing something worse. They have been using the deaths of these four Americans for political campaign fundraising. I call on the Speaker of the House to end that process right now. For example. on February 17. Chairman ISSA traveled to New Hampshire to attend a political fundraiser. where he spoke about Benghazi. He suggested during his speech that our militarys response on the night of the attacks was deficient because Secretary Clinton ordered Defense Secretary Panetta to ""stand down."" That was a shocking accusation. and he had absolutely no evidencenoneto support it. In my opinion. his statements were reprehensible not only to the Secretary of State but to our brave men and women in uniform. And so today. we are here to consider a resolution to create another partisan committee to investigate what the Speaker and his five chairmen have already been investigating. With all due respect. if the Republicans want to fix the problems with their partisan investigation. they need more than just a new chairman. They need a new approach. I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from South Carolina . and I am glad that he said that fundraising should not be done on the deaths of these four people. and I hope that the Republican Conference will finally agree with that. We are better than that. They need a new approach. one that is truly bipartisan. and one that seeks the facts before drawing conclusions. rather than the other way around."

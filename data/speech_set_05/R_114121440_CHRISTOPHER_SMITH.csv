1140003974,"Madam Speaker. I thank my friend for yielding and for her leadership. and for reminding us that this bill passed the House last year in identical form. The only thing changed are the dates. because obviously they had to be updated. It is a 12page bill which can be very quickly read by any Member. And the only reason we have to be here is because the Senate wouldnt provide a vote on it. So the Senate just shelved it. and we are now bringing it back up on the floor. Madam Speaker. because abortion dismembers. decapitates. or chemically poisons unborn children to deaththe part of abortion that my friends on the other side of this issue have a keen reluctance to not look at and to avoid. abortion methodswe know we will soon have the paincapable legislation on the floor. and it will come to the floor. We know that children suffer excruciating pain from dismemberment. Piece by piece. a child is literally pulled apartarms. legs. torso. and decapitation. That is the reality of abortion. Madam Speaker. Because of all of this. Americans have consistently demandedand now in evergrowing numbersthat public funds not pay for abortion. I would point out to my colleagues that yesterday the Marist Poll found that 68 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortions. and that includes 69 percent of women. 71 percent of the next generation. the millennials. oppose taxpayer funding for abortion. Madam Speaker. H.R. 7 will save lives. We know the Hyde amendment has probably saved at least 1 million lives. children who are on soccer fields today or in school. perhaps even getting married. people who live because the Hyde amendment has been in effect since the 1970s. Over a million children are alive because of that restriction of abortion from Medicaid funding. H.R. 7 seeks to accomplish three goals. It makes the Hyde amendment and other current funding prohibitions permanent. so they dont have to be included in the annual appropriations bills. It ensures that the Affordable Care Act faithfully conforms with the Hyde amendment. as promised by the President. It provides full disclosure. transparency. and prominent display of the extent to which any health insurance plan on the exchange funds abortion. Now. that is all being done stealthily. hidden from the consumer. They have no idea when they are buying a plan that the plan is paying for abortion on demand. Let me remind my colleagues that in the runup to passage of the Affordable Care Act. Americans were assured by President Obama himself. right there at the podium. and he said in September of 2009 that ""under our plan. no Federal dollars will be used to fund abortion."" That is the Presidents word. He also said on March 24. 2010. in order to get a number of prolife Democrats. he gave them his word and wrote that the Affordable Care Act ""maintains current Hyde amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to newly created health insurance exchanges."" Nothing. Madam Speaker. could be further from the truth. We asked the General Accountability Office last year to look into how many of these plans were paying for abortion. They came back and said well over 1.000 insurance plans on the exchange were funding abortion on demand. completely contrary to what our President told us would be the case in a speech to all of us in 2009 and then in an executive order that he issued. Agree or disagree on the abortion issue. but lets always be truthful. President Obama told us funding wouldnt be in there. yet it is. There is also problems with transparency. Senator Ben Nelson. in order to procure his vote. said there has to be two payments for abortion if it is included when the bill is on the Senate side. He said: ""If you are receiving Federal assistance to buy insurance and if that plan has any abortion coverage. the insurance company must bill you separately. and you must pay separately from your own personal fundsperhaps a credit card transaction. your separate personal check. or automatic withdrawal from your bank accountfor that abortion coverage. Now. let me say that again. You have to write two checks: one for the basic policy and one for the additional coverage for abortion."" That is not being implemented either. so the premium is all rolled into one. Again. conscientious prolife Americans who do not want to be complicit in the wounding of women and the killing of babies are paying for abortion. and many of them dont even know it. I hope that Members will vote for the rule. and to those who think that there will be no debate and vote on the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. that will come to the floor. and. again. you defend dismemberment abortions at 20 weeks. 21 weeks. 23 weeks. where the child suffers excruciating pain. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140025037,"Madam Speaker. 2 years ago today Pennsylvania abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was convicted of murder. conspiracy to kill. and involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to life imprisonment. Even though the news of Gosnells child slaughter was largely suppressed by the mainstream media. many of my colleagues may remember that Dr. Gosnell operated a large Philadelphia abortion clinic where women died and countless babies were dismembered or chemically destroyed. often by having their spinal cord snipped. all gruesome procedures causing excruciating pain to the victim. Today. the House considers landmark legislation authored by Congressman TRENT FRANKS to protect unborn children beginning at the age of 20 weeks postfertilization from these painfilled abortions. The PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act is needed now more than ever because there are Gosnells all over America. dismembering and decapitating paincapable babies for profit: men like Steven Brigham of New Jersey. an interstate abortion operatorsome 35 aborted babies were found in his freezer. men like Leroy Carhart. caught on videotape joking about his abortion toolkit. complete with. as he said. a pickaxe and drill bit. while describing a 3daylong lateterm abortion procedure and the infant victim as ""putting meat in a CrockPot."" Some euphemistically call this choice. but a growing number of Americans rightly regard it as violence against children. and huge majorities60 percent. according to the November Quinnipiac pollwant it stopped. Fresh impetus for this bill came from a huge study of nearly 5.000 babies. preemies. published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine. The next day The New York Times article titled ""Premature Babies May Survive At 22 Weeks If Treated"" touted the Journals extraordinary findings of survival and hope. Just imagine. Madam Speaker. preemies at 20 weeks are surviving. as technology and medical science advances. Alexis Hutchinson. featured in The New York Times story. is today a healthy 5yearold who originally weighed in at a mere 1.1 pounds. Thus. the babies we seek to protect from harm today may indeed survive if treated humanely. with expertise and with an abundance of compassion. I urge support for the legislation."
1140035305,Mr. Speaker. I thank our distinguished chairman and thank both he and ELIOT ENGEL for the leadership that they have both shown. Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for keeping that focus on all issues related to Iran and for doing it so effectively. including and especially the human rights abuses that are occurring there each and every day. Mr. Speaker. the most important duty of the President of the United States is to keep Americans safe from harm. whether they are at home or abroad. Three innocent Americans continue to be brutalized in Iran prisons and trapped in a system of sham trials. A fourth American. another innocent man. has been missing from Iran for more than 8 years and presumed to also be imprisoned in that country. When Americans have been hostages in foreign lands or on foreign seas. Presidents from both parties have prioritized their rescue. sometimes even asking the finest from our fighting forces to risk their lives to save them. It is an important question why the President has failed to make the release of our fellow Americans his top priority with the Iranian regime. How often have we heard the administration speak out. pressure being put to bear on the Iranian regime. even as the talks continue on the nuclear issue? It seems to me I will never forget when Nagameh Abedini came and testified at one of Frank Wolfs hearings. She said they told her there was nothing they could do for her husband at the U.S. Department of State. Thankfully. a call to John Kerry by Mr. Wolf. chairman of the Lantos committee at the time. did yield fruit. and they did begin to raise his name and his calls. The President seems to think. however. that the Iranian regime can be trusted to keep a nuclear deal and no longer seek to develop and make nuclear weapons. I would suggest that a regime that continues to imprison our fellow citizens cannot be trusted. A regime that so regularly and violently violates human rights and basic freedoms of its own people cannot be trusted. A regime that sponsors terrorism against other countries as a tool of foreign policy cannot be trusted. H. Res. 233 makes very clear that Iran should release all detained U.S. citizens immediately and provide any information it possesses regarding any United States citizens that have disappeared within its borders. Mr. Speaker. we must remember the husbands and fathers. sons and daughters. the families. in addition to those who are being exploited and cruelly mistreated. I want to thank Chairman ROYCE for the hearing that he just convened a few days ago. We heard from the family members. Their plea was impassioned. It was heartbreaking. and it was very. very motivating. Imprisoned since 2012. Pastor Abedini. 35 years old. husband of Nagameh Abediniwho testified several times before my subcommittee and has been an extraordinary champion for his releasefather of two children. he had returned to Iran to build an orphanage. He had gotten prior clearance. told that he could do it. Once he was there. they arrested him. and they have mistreated him ever since then. Imprisoned since 2012. Amir Hekmati. 31 years old. a former sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps. He had returned to Iran to visit his grandmother and other relatives. They scooped him up. and he has been mistreated ever since. Imprisoned since 2011. Jason Rezaian. 39 years old. Tehrans bureau chief for The Washington Post. a reporter who publishes what is going on in that regime. he now is facing a trial. a show trial. a sham trial. Imprisoned since 2014. Robert Levinson. 67 years old. husband. father. grandfather. he has been missing in Iran since the year 2007. Mr. Speaker. Pastor Abedini. Mr. Hekmati. Mr. Rezaian. and Mr. LEVINson are all Americans. and they are being. right today. subjected to abuse and cruelty. They are all prisoners or missing in Iran. We call on the administration to retriple its efforts to secure their release.
1140052916,"I thank my good friend for yielding. Madam Speaker. last week Pope Francis admonished a joint session of Congress to follow the Golden Ruleto do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The Pope also said the Golden Rule compels us to protect and defend human life at every stage of developmentand. of course. that includes the unborn. It is wrong to remain silent. he said. or to look the other way when individuals are put at risk. At the White House welcoming ceremony earlier in the day. President Obama spoke of protecting the least of these. taken from Matthews Gospel. the 25th chapter. When President Obama says protect the least of these. he excludes millions of unborn children. Every day Planned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons to death approximately 900 unborn babies. the least of these. and hurts many women in the process. Subsidized by half a billion dollars annually. Planned Parenthood kills a baby every 2 minutes and has terminated the lives of over 7 million infants since 1973. a staggering loss of childrens lives that equates to twice the number of every man. woman and child living in the State of Connecticut. So I rise in strong support of H.R. 3495. the Womens Health and Public Safety Act. authored by our distinguished colleague. SEAN DUFFY. to give States the authority to defund Planned Parenthood. States. indeed. Madam Speaker. should have the freedom to choose who they subsidize and why. But the President has denied that option to at least six States so far. including Texas. Arizona. Indiana. Louisiana. Alabama. and Arkansas. The latter three States had moved to defund in the wake of the recent undercover videos by the Center for Medical Progress. Now. because of the CMP videos. we know Planned Parenthood is also trafficking in baby body parts. I would note parenthetically. Madam Speaker. I wrote the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to try to end the cruelty of modernday slavery. sex trafficking. and labor trafficking. Planned Parenthoods activities are a manifestation of human trafficking. exploiting defenseless unborn children and taking body parts that they have no right to take. It turns out Planned Parenthood has turned these babies into human guinea pigs. and it makes the abortion industry even richer. Although much of the media continues to ignore this scandal. Planned Parenthoods meticulously crafted facade of care and compassion has been shattered. Caught on tape. Planned Parenthoods top leadership. not interns or lower level employees. show callous disregard for precious childrens lives while gleefully calculating the financial gain. which begs the question: Do Americans understand the violence to children done every day in Planned Parenthood clinics? Have my Congressional colleagues. has the President. actually watched the videos? To care for the least of these. have they watched them? In one clip. Dr. Deborah Nucatola. Senior Director of Planned Parenthood Federation of Americas Medical Services. says: ""We have been very good at getting heart. lung. liver. because we know that I am not going to crush that part."" So they crush all around that part that is desired. dismember that baby piece by piece. but they leave intact certain parts. including livers. that will then be sold. Planned Parenthood Medical Directors Council President Dr. Mary Gatter appears on the video nonchalantly talking about utilizing a ""less crunchy""-her wordsabortion method. again. to preserve body parts. Regarding the price tag for baby body parts. she says: ""Let me just figure out what others are getting. And if this in the ballpark. then it is fine."" ""If it is still low. then we can bump it up."" she says. Another Planned Parenthood Director. Deborah VanDerhei. says: ""We are just trying to figure out as an industry""-and it is the abortion industry""we are just trying to figure out how we are going to manage remuneration because the headlines would be a disaster."" Concern for making money. finding another revenue stream. but no concern whatsoever for that child victim who suffers when they are dismembered: arms. legs. torso. decapitated head. It is gruesome dismemberment abortions. That is what Planned Parenthood does. One woman. Holly ODonnell. from StemExpress. says: ""She gave me the scissors and told me that I had to cut down the middle of the face."" ""I cant even describe what that feels like."" she says. I suspect that. if the President watches at least one of the videos and my colleagues on the other side. they would at least demand real answers concerning Planned Parenthoods inhumane behavior and violence that is directed at the least of these."
1140056864,Mr. Speaker. first of all. let me thank KEVIN BRADY. the chairman. for his extraordinary leadership on this and so many other issues. and Mr. BLUMENAUER. with whom we have worked together to build a strong bipartisan push for this piece of legislation. I do rise in strong support for passage of S. 1362. the PACE Innovation Act. Identical to the companion bill that I introduced along with Mr. BLUMENAUER. this bill will provide PACE programs with flexibility to bring a proven model of care to new populations. The program for allinclusive care for the elderly. or PACE. is a widely popular program serving over 30.000 seniors around the country. For those unfamiliar with PACE. the program delivers the entire range of medical and longterm services. including medical care and prescription drug services. physical or occupational therapy. day or respite care. and medical specialties such as dentistry. optometry. and podiatry. Currently. eligibility for PACE is limited to those aged 55 and over who meet Statespecified criteria for needing nursing homelevel care. This program will provide wellness and keeps people in their homes. It is already doing it. Now more people will benefit from it. It improves outcomes. And this is all for people who otherwise would be paying catastrophic costs for nursing home care. Mr. Speaker. PACE has seen a significant growth in recent years. including a 30 percent increase in the number of people receiving services over the last 3 years alone. PACE has a proven track record in my own State of New Jersey where programs currently serve roughly 900 seniors throughout the State. Just last week. Mr. Speaker. I had the opportunity to attend the grand opening and ribbon cutting of a new PACE program in Monmouth County. and it is New Jerseys fifth program. When I first heard about PACE. I worked hard to bring this valuable program to my State back in 2009. Even though it was around before that. it was one of the best kept secrets around. They then formed the first PACE program called LIFE. Living Independently for Elderly. at St. Francis Medical Center in the Trenton and Hamilton area. I have visited St. Francis LIFE often since and on its fifth anniversary was overwhelmed by the appreciation of seniors and their families for the programs ability to raise or maintain their quality of life. The limits. however. and operational restrictions placed on PACE do not allow these programs to serve many others in need. Chronological age should not be the determinant. If somebody is disabled and could use and should use a nursing home and is eligible. this gives another option to the family to keep them at home. The legislation will allow CMS to establish pilot programs and waive restrictions and test how to best deliver results for new populations. As Tim Clontz. the chairman of the National PACE Associations Public Policy Committee. testified before the Health Subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce Committee. he told stories about a man named Jim G.. a 54yearold man with earlyonset Alzheimers disease. He was hospitalized for a lung infection and. as a result. stayed home alone during the day. where he was isolated and struggled with activities of daily living. such as personal grooming. household chores. and child care. His wife quit her job to care for him full time. but his needs were more than she could handle. He was permanently placed in a memory care unit. and since PACE was not an option for Jimremember. he is 54 years oldhis wife is crowdsourcing to try to pay his medical care. This heartbreaking story could have been eliminated. I also chair the Alzheimers Caucus. Mr. Speaker. here in the House. and I can tell you there are many patients with early onset who could benefit and benefit in a very. very significant way with this change in law. I look forward to the Presidents signature. Again. I want to thank you. Kevin. for your leadership and your very distinguished staff.
1140091933,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank my good friend. Chairman ROYCE. for his leadership on this bill. the markup. and for the very timely recommendations he and staff made to improve it. I would like to thank ELIOT ENGEL again for working hand in glove in a good. bipartisan effort to protect international religious freedom. As my good friend. Chairman ROYCE. noted a moment ago. 18 years ago Congress had the foresight to pass the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. That landmark bill. authored by Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia. made advancing the right to religious freedom a significant and profoundly serious U.S. foreign policy priority. Passage of the International Religious Freedom Act was not easy. There were determined opponents in Congress and in the Clinton administration. I know. I chaired the congressional hearings and the subcommittee markup. It was no cakewalk. But our opposition was overcome by the courage. tenacity. and vision of Frank Wolf. bolstered by a diverse. bipartisan. and ecumenical coalition of Members of Congress. ethnic minority and religions groups. and human rights organizations. That coalition has reassembled to support this bill today. the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. I want to especially thank ANNA ESHOO. who is the principal Democratic sponsor of this legislation. for her leadership and for working particularly in the Middle East to combat the savagery that is being imposed upon people of minority faiths. including Christians. I thank her for her leadership and. again. for being the principal Democrat on this bill. Let me just note that naming this bill after Frank Wolf. who I consider to be. and many of us consider to be the William Wilberforce of modern times. is an attempt to recognize his extraordinary lifes work promoting human rights. 34 years as a Member of Congress. including. and especially. religious freedom. He now serves as the Wilson Chair at Baylor. again. continuing his lifesaving work for religious believers all over the world. He just returned from Nigeria and testified at our hearing last week. He was in the embattled states in northern Nigeria. where Boko Haram runs free. massacring people. He was there on a factfinding mission to promote religious freedom. Mr. Speaker. the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act that is before us is a series of upgrades to meet the challenges of the 21st century. We know that the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis of international religious freedom. a crisis that continues to create millionsno. tens of millions of victims. a crisis that undermines liberty. prosperity. and peace. a crisis that poses a direct challenge to the U.S. interests in the Middle East. Russia. China. SubSaharan Africa. and elsewhere in the world. The Pew Research Center notes that over 75 percent of the worlds population today lives in countries where severe religious freedom abuses occur annually. According to Pew. instances of antiSemitism are at a 7year high. It is getting worse everywhere. particularly in the Middle East. but also in Europe and in the United States. Mr. Speaker. ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria are on the verge of extinction. and other religious minorities in the Middle East face a constant assault from the Islamic State. Several weeks ago. this Congress passed a resolution. sponsored by JEFF FORTENBERRY. that was followed by a declaration by Secretary of State John Kerry. that said that ISIS has committed. and continues to commit genocide. mass atrocities and war crimes against Christians. Yazidis. and other minority faiths. We are on record. We know it is happening. We are speaking out. In a couple of weeks. I am chairing a hearing on what is next. what should we be doing next to combat this terrible. terrible crisis. In Nigeria. the Islamist terror group. Boko Haram. is believed to have killed over 6.600 people last year alone. mostly Christian. but there are Muslims as well who are being targeted. According to the testimony we received last week. since 2009. the number is about 15.000 year to date since 2009. Mr. Speaker. at one of those hearings a few years ago. I had a man named Habila. Habila. I met him at an IDP camp in Jos. Nigeria. where a lot of churches have been firebombed. He told me this story. He was credible. and it checked out. And he came to Congress and testified. Boko Haram put an AK47a terroristto his jaw and said: Renounce Christ or I will kill you. You must become a Muslim on the spot. Habila said: I am ready to meet my Lord. And this terrorist pulled the trigger and blew most of his face away. What courage. what faith for a man. And when he told the story. you could have heard a pin drop. Mr. Speaker. the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom just released its 2016 annual report. And let me note. parenthetically. USCIRF. or that Commission. was also created by Chairman Wolf as part of IRFA. the original bill. They have found that the abuses committed by governments and nonstate actors has ""deteriorated."" ""The incarceration of prisoners of conscience""-they point out-""remains astonishingly widespread. . ."" They point out that ""Over the past year. the Chinese government""-as just one of many examples-""has stepped up its persecution of religious groups""-across the board: Tibetans. Uighurs. Muslim Uighurs. Christians. and. of course. the Falun Gong. I spoke in midFebruary at NYU. I gave a keynote there in Shanghai. and talked about how Xi Jinping. the President of China. is in a race to the bottom with North Korea to make religion absolutely subservient to the Communist Party. He calls it the sinification of religion. and what was already a bad situation has now become demonstrably worse. The Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will upgrade the tools so that this administration. and subsequent ones. can do an even better job to try to mitigate and. hopefully. end religious persecution. It does this by. one. requiring that international religious freedom policies be integrated into national security. immigration. rule of law. and other relevant U.S. foreign policies. It creates a Designated Persons List of individuals sanctioned for participating in or directing religious freedom abuses. It expands diplomatic training on international religious freedoms for all State Department diplomats. creates a tier system for IRFA. for the reports. not just countries of particular concern. of which there are currently 10. but also those that are on a watch list. those that are bad and. perhaps. getting worse. It gives the President authority to designate nonstate actors in addition to countries. and it also requires the Ambassador at Large to report directly to the Secretary of State. It also is increasingly clear that religious freedom diplomacy is really needed to advance U.S. interests around the world. This will do it. The legislation is backed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the International Religious Freedom Roundtable. a diverse and ecumenical group of individuals from the faith community. Finally. just let me thank Scott Flipse. who worked for Frank Wolf previously. then he worked for the International Religious Freedom Office at the State Department. and now is working at the China Commission. our General Counsel. Piero Tozzi. Janice Kaguyutan. I thank her for her work on this. and Sajit Gandhi. This is a true. bipartisan piece of legislation and. hopefully. the Senate will favorably receive it."
1140105205,"Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Florida for his extraordinary leadership on this bill and on the life issue. Mr. Chairman. on June 8. 1983. 33 years ago. I sponsored the amendment to ban the use of taxpayer funds to subsidize abortion in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The Smith amendment passed 226 to 182. and has been in effect almost continuously ever since. Today. more Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortions than ever before. A January 2016 Marist poll found a supermajority of Americans68 percent of all respondents and 69 percent of womenoppose taxpayer funding for abortion. Why do Americans continue to trend prolife? First. the prolife movement is comprised of millions of selfless. compassionate human rights defenders. women and men. filled with deep faith in God. hope. love. and indomitable spirits. Second. postabortive women are silent no more. courageously speaking to the extraordinary harm they have endured from abortion. As the NGO Feminists for Life have reminded us. women deserve better than abortion. Third. sonograms. ultrasound imagery. is a game changer. Countless parents have watched with awe and wonder as their child appears on the screen. moving about. even sucking his or her thumb. First baby pictures today are of the child before birth. That first picture is a powerful confirmation that their child exists and that they are parents now and that birth is merely an event in the life of a child. Ultrasounds have also been an effective tool in helping to diagnose and to treat disease and disability for these young patients. Some unborn children indeed are the youngest patients in need of benign interventions. I would note to my colleagues that for the past several years. there has been a global movement called The First Thousand Days of Life. providing for nutrition and supplementation to bolster the health and wellness of children and women from conception until the second birthday. The consequences of caring for children before birth is absolutely revolutionary and breathtaking. boosting their immunity as well as their cognitive abilities throughout their entire lifetime. Abortion. on the other hand. is the polar opposite of life. It is violence against children. Abortion methods dismember. decapitate. or chemically poison innocent babies to death. Laterterm abortions inflict excruciating pain and suffering on the child. especially during the dismemberment procedure. The Grayson amendment would reverse over three decades of prudent public policy that ensures that taxpayers do not subsidize abortion. I would note parenthetically that the law governing the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program specifies that the Federal Government contributes at least 72 percent of the average premium cost for all plans. so it is taxpayers who are footing the bill. Vote ""no"" on the Grayson amendment."
1140108672,"I thank my good friend. Mrs. Foxx for yielding and thank her for her extraordinary Prolife leadership. Madam Speaker. in an unconscionable abuse of power. for almost 2 years. the State of California has forced all insurance plans under its purview and the people in institutions that pay the premiumsto subsidize abortion on demand. Numerous faithbased entities filed complaints pursuant to law with the HHS Office for Civil Rights seeking. and fully expecting. relief. Effective June 21. however. the Obama administration flatly refused to enforce U.S. lawcurrent lawprotecting the civil right of conscience. Cardinal Timothy Dolan said. ""It is shocking that HHS has allowed the State of California to force all employerseven churchesto fund and facilitate elective abortions in their health insurance plans."" I would note parenthetically to my colleagues. this isnt about ObamaCare and the massive taxpayer funding for abortion embeddedaccording to GAOs analysisin over 1.000 insurance plans on the exchanges. which was contrary to what the President had promised right here in this Chamber. 30 feet away from me. in a joint session of Congress in 2009. No. This is about private health insurance plans of Catholic dioceses. religious schools. and others who have been ordered to violate their deeply held convictions and pay for the killing of unborn children by hideous dismemberment procedures. toxic compounds. or chemical poisoning. The Weldon Federal conscience clause. authored by Congressman Dave Weldon of Florida and continuously in effect for well over a decade. is explicit and comprehensive. but it is not being enforced by the Obama Administration. The Weldon amendment says. in pertinent part. that it is illegal for any ""discrimination"" against a healthcare entity ""on the basis that the healthcare entity does not provide. pay for. provide coverage of. or refer for abortions."" The laws definition of healthcare entity explicitly includes ""a health insurance plan."" Despite the absolute clarity of the Weldon language. injured parties. including the Catholic church. have been denied relief. The Obama Administrations refusal to enforce the civil right of conscience is not only unfair and unjustified. it violates the rule of law. makes a mockery of the Presidents 2009 Notre Dame speech. mentioned by my colleague from Missouri. when Obama said: ""Lets honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion."" Mr. Obamas words dont match his deeds and he is not honoring the civil rights of conscience. The Conscience Protection Act of 2016. authored by Congresswoman DIANE BLACK. seeks to end discrimination against people. plans. and providers for refusing to be involved in the killing of unborn children. The bill says that the Federal Government or any State or local government that receives Federal assistance may not penalize. retaliate against. or otherwise discriminate against those who refuse to perform. refer for. pay for. or otherwise participate in abortion. The linchpin of this legislation. of the Conscience Protection Act. protects people. insurance plans. and other entities from being forced to participate by providing a private right of action. The HHS Office for Civil Rights has failed miserably. In this country. we need a remedy that is durable and that will provide the protection that people are demanding. especially today in California. but really the entire country."
1140111193,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of this resolution (H. Res. 660) to support the territorial integrity of Georgia. I want to thank my good friends and colleagues Mr. POE and Mr. CONNOLLY for introducing this excellent resolution. which condemns Russias ongoing illegal activities along the occupation line in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Mr. Speaker. Russias invasion and occupation of Georgian territory violates the Helsinki Final Act. as well as the core principles of several multilateral agreements. the Budapest Memorandum. and the United Nations Charter. The United States has not recognized Russias illegal attempt to separate Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia as legitimate in any wayand this resolution sends a powerful message that in this policy the administration has the full support of Congress. I was in Georgia in August. 2008. arriving about two weeks after the Russian invasion. The human suffering generated by the invasion was immense. with over 192.000 people displaced and several hundred killed. Several of my constituents found themselves trapped behind Russian lines in South Ossetia&mdash.we were able to get them out with help from our very capable ambassador. John Tefft. now serving as our ambassador to Russia. and the assistance of another countrys diplomatic mission. The Russian occupation of Georgian territory is a festering sore that has not healed in the eight years that have elapsed since the invasion. Mr. Speaker. the resolution notes: ""the Russian Federation is building barbed wire fences and installing. socalled border signs and other artificial barriers along the occupation line and depriving the people residing within the occupied regions and in the adjacent areas of their fundamental rights and freedoms."" Mr. Speaker. I saw this new Iron Curtain with my own eyes in July. I was in Georgia. leading the U.S. Delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. and made a visit to what our embassy calls the occupation line with some of my congressional colleagues. We looked over Russias fortified line from an observation platformand what we saw reminded me of the old Soviet Union. The Russian troops came to the checkpoint and made people wait upwards of 12 hours to cross over with foodstuffs and reach people on the other side. A Russian guard used a camera to film me and the other members who were standing on the platform. Tensions were thick. Mr. Speaker. this resolution comes at a timely moment. as Georgia prepares for its parliamentary elections in October. It reminds Georgians as they prepare to go to the polls that the U.S. supports them in their efforts to develop a sovereign. independent. and prosperous country. I thank my good friend Mr. POE for introducing this resolution in support of Georgia and urge my colleagues to support it."

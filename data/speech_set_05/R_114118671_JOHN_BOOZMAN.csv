1140053867,Mr. President. yesterday Congress passed yet another shortterm continuing resolution. While this avoids a shutdown. it is far from ideal. Certainly a shutdown is not good governing. I think all of us can agree on that much. I wish to remind my colleagues. thoughparticularly those on the other side of the aislethat continuing resolutions are hardly better. While the American people demand that we get our financial house in order. Washington continues to pass stopgap after stopgap funding bills. Instead of tackling this challenge headon. these shortterm extensions continue current funding levels and prevent us from stopping waste. fraud. and abuse of taxpayer dollars. Just like a shutdown. this. too. is no way to govern. There is another option. We dont have to choose between a continuing resolution and a shutdown. The third choice is the right choice. and that choice is for this Chamber to follow regular order and pass all 12 appropriations bills. We have done our work at the Appropriations Committee. For the first time in 6 years. every spending bill has cleared committeeall 12and most of them passed with strong bipartisan support. I commend the Appropriations Chairman COCHRAN and Leader MCCONNELL for their leadership to make that happen. The full Senate has the responsibility to consider each of these bills as well. Leader MCCONNELL is committed to this approach. Our caucus is behind it 100 percent. The minority. on the other hand. is actively working against it. Committee passage of these 12 bills was no easy task. Both sides made compromises. These bills were the product of a great deal of giveandtake. We worked very hard for months to ensure that these bills reflect the spending and policy priorities that are right for our Nation. These bills should not simply be left for dead. The President is encouraging the Senate Democrats to obstruct the appropriations process because he wants more domestic spending for agencies like the EPA and IRS. This is not the direction our country needs to go. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider this failed strategy. The funding bills show the American people that we share their priorities. For instance. the bill before us takes care of our Active Military and our veterans when they return home. Clearly this is an area of bipartisan agreement. Yet talk of a filibuster remains. Here is what the minority is considering filibustering: increases in funding for veterans services. military housing and family support. hospital and health facilities construction. just to name a few vital things in this bill. The bill increases funding in areas where our veterans need it mosthealth care. benefit claims processing. and medical research. It also includes funding for projects to ensure military readiness and improve the quality of life for military families. In light of the numerous scandals that have plagued the VA. it includes some strong policy reforms such as protection for whistleblowers. These are funding and policy priorities for both sides of the aisle. That is why this bill passed out of the Appropriations Committee with strong bipartisan support. That is why it should move forward without resistance on the Senate floor. Yet the minority is threatening a filibuster for reasons that have nothing to do with this bill. This is all about protecting the Presidents agenda. President Obama wants spending increases across the board. He has issued a blanket veto threat for any appropriations bill that does not meet his demands. Basically. the Presidents view is that if such agencies dont get more money. then neither should our veterans or military families. It is my hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize this is out of line with our Nations priorities. The right thing to do is reject the Presidents call to obstruct so we can continue to work together for the good of the country. Determining how we allocate taxpayer dollars is our responsibility. not the Presidents. Continuing resolutions have been all too common. while they should be a rare exception. We need to reestablish our priority of regular order and pass the individual funding bills that are needed to keep the government open. We can start that today and by moving the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill forward. I yield the floor.
1140072306,"Madam President. I am here today with my colleague Senator COTTON to honor Dale Bumpers. a longtime advocate of Arkansas. who passed away on January 1 at the age of 90 after a long life of dedicated public service. He was a soldier and a statesman who came from the small town of Charleston. AR. He did things not because of political pressure but because he believed they were the right things to do. He had a good foundation to understand the needs of Arkansans. He was a businessman. taking over operations at his fathers former hardware. furniture. and appliance store. and he was a rancher and an attorney in Charleston. serving. as his memoirs indicate. as ""the best lawyer in a onelawyer town."" Following the Supreme Courts decision in the 1954 case Brown v. Board of Education. which outlawed segregation in schools. he advised compliance with the ruling. making it the first school district in the South to fully integrate. He ran against incumbent Governor Winthrop Rockefeller to become the 38th Governor of the State of Arkansas. Four years later. he defeated longtime Senator William Fulbright in a primary before winning a seat in the Senate. a position he held for 24 years. He served as the chairman of the committee on small business from 1987 to 1994 and has a long list of accomplishments. While he ended his Senate service more than a decade before I started serving in this Chamber. my colleagues who served alongside him regularly recall their memories of Senator Bumpers. a legendary orator who had a true gift for public speaking and who would tell stories in a way only a Southern gentleman with a keen sense of humor from smalltown Arkansas could. He was passionate about his convictions and spoke from his heart about matters that he believed in. In tributes to him on the floor during the last days of the 105th Congress. his colleagues described him as one of the most respected Members of this body. He was a champion of the environment. a supporter of the National Institutes of Health. funding the fight against HIV and AIDS. and a constant proponent Sll for Arkansans. You could tell by all of the things that bear his namethe White River National Wildlife Refuge. the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center. His impact on Arkansas agriculture was recognized by the University of Arkansas board of trustees. who renamed the college of agriculture the ""Dale Bumpers College of Agriculture. Food and Life Sciences."" These are just a few of the many things in Arkansas that reflect his dedication and commitment to our State. Senator Bumpers leaves behind a legacy of public service. civic responsibility. and accomplishments that has undoubtedly made Arkansas a better place to live. I yield the floor."
1140080191,"Mr. President. prescription drug abuse is the fastest growing problem in the country. It is a problem the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies as an epidemic. The availability of prescription painkillers is a leading factor in the increase of opioid abuse. Since 1999. opioid abuse overdose deaths have quadrupled nationwide. Unfortunately. my home State of Arkansas is not immune to the problem. CDC data shows that it is one of 12 States with more painkiller prescriptions than peopleI repeat. one of 12 States with more painkiller prescriptions than people. Benton. AR. police chief Kirk Lane has seen the impact in his community. During a recent visit to my office. he said: ""A lot of people become addicted very innocently and cant find a way back."" Placing prescription drugs in the medicine cabinet for safekeeping is no longer the best option because 70 percent of Americans misusing painkillers are getting them from friends and family. Arkansas has implemented measures to combat this problem by decreasing the availability of prescription drugs and properly disposing expired and unneeded medication through the Arkansas Take Back Program. This is an important step that has resulted in the removal of more than 72 tons of unneeded medication from homes in the State. Congress has taken action to fight this epidemic. As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. I have pushed the Department of Veterans Affairs to reform its culture of prescription. Nationwide. pharmacies have a system in place to prevent overfilling prescriptions. It is time for VA to adopt a similar system. I pressured the DEAthe Drug Enforcement Administrationto reform its policy to allow clinics and pharmacies to serve as dropoff sites for the collection of unused or unwanted prescription drugs. Last year. we passed legislation to improve the prevention and treatment of opioid abuse by pregnant women and care for newborns affected by this abuse. That bill was signed into law. Congress approved more than $400 million in funding to address the opioid epidemic this fiscal year. That is an increase of more than $100 million from the previous year. Calls for additional funds for this legislation are premature. We need to see the progress and results made with the current finding. We must continue our commitment to the fighting of this epidemic and providing our communities with the tools they need to improve response to addiction and promote treatment and recovery. That is why we need to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This bill can help give communities the ability to combat the growing opioid epidemic in Arkansas and across the country by expanding prevention efforts. supporting law enforcement. combating overdoses. and expanding access to treatment. I have heard from many Arkansans who support this bill. It has the support of a wide range of organizations that represent law enforcement officials. drug treatment providers. and health care professionals. This speaks to the comprehensive approach we are taking to fight this epidemic. It also authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to veterans treatment courts. These courts are critical in helping our veterans break the cycle of addiction and turning their lives around. Prescription drug abuse is a widespread problem that impacts all ages and populations of Americans. I am committed to providing Arkansas communities the resources they need to fight this epidemic. Mr. President. I yield the floor."
1140088478,Mr. President. today I wish to recognize Hugh McDonald. president of Entergy Arkansas. as he prepares to retire. Hugh McDonald is a resident of Little Rock and has been with Entergy since 1982. He holds a bachelors of science degree in construction management from North Dakota State University and a master of business administration degree from the University of New Orleans. Hugh began his career at Entergy over 30 years ago in Louisiana. where he rose through the ranks before being promoted to director of regulatory affairs for Entergy Texas and then senior vice president of energy retail operations. He came to Arkansas 16 years ago to accept his current position. Entergy Arkansas provides electricity to approximately 700.000 customers in 63 counties and is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation. As the head of Arkansas largest utility. McDonald demonstrated excellent leadership during his 16year tenure. He led its decision to withdraw from the system agreement that forced Arkansas ratepayers to partially bear the cost of producing electricity in other Entergy States. He also spearheaded the movement to join the Midcontinent Independent System Operator. which allowed greater access to economic generation resources and saved Arkansas customers $46 million in the first year of participation. Hugh is a past board member and board chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He also serves on the boards of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce. the Arkansas Research Alliance Board. the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce. and Fifty for the Future. In addition. Hugh serves on the boards of the University of Arkansas Sam Walton College of Business Advisory Board. the UALR College of Business Advisory Council. the UAMS BioVentures Advisory Board. and the Nature Conservancy of Arkansas. Let me reiterate how grateful I am for Hugh McDonalds management and vision during his time at the helm of Entergy Arkansas. His guidance and stewardship of the company has resulted in vital. reliable electricity for thousands of Arkansans across the State. I thank Hugh for his distinguished career and wish him well in retirement.
1140093917,"Mr. President. I want to express my strong support for the 2017 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. Senator COLLINS and Senator REED deserve tremendous credit for their leadership on this bipartisan bill. Congress has the basic responsibility to determine how we spend hardearned taxpayer dollars. It is a responsibility that my colleagues and I on the Appropriations Committee take very seriously. Debating and passing these annual bills provides accountability. It is an important part of setting priorities. making choices. and reducing waste. Last week. the Senate passed an energy and water appropriations bill crafted by Senators ALEXANDER and FEINSTEIN. While I dont serve on their subcommittee. I was very proud to support their bill. and I congratulate them on moving forward and making the process work. The 2017 Transportation and HUD appropriations bill is the latest example of the Senates return to regular order. This process enables all Senators to play an active role in the legislative process and to address concerns that are important to their States. This bill is crafted with bipartisan support. and it helps to drive the growth of our Nation. Senators COLLINS and REED have put in a lot of work to prepare this bill for consideration. as have both of their staffs. The discretionary spending in this bill is within the budget caps. and it reflects a responsible approach. The bill strengthens our countrys infrastructure and transportation system. This week is recognized as Infrastructure Week. and I have heard from several Arkansans that this must remain a priority. Our citizens have opportunities. and our Nation is a powerful economic force. thanks in part to our roads and bridges. airports. waterways. and related structures. We need to maintain our roads because they provide a reliable way to move goods and services around the country and. with the rest of our infrastructure. to countries around the world. These investments lead to job creation and greatly benefit our economy. The bill provides critical funding to modernize air traffic control. While our current system is second to none in safety. the FAA must accelerate its progress toward operating a more efficient system. A modern air traffic control system will be more convenient for travelers. it will save money. and it will clean the environment by reducing the amount of fuel used by aircraft. The bill provides critical funding to improve air traffic certification services. These improvements can help aircraft manufacturers. including those in Arkansas. that are fighting to win in a competitive global market. The bill provides critical highway funding that is consistent with the longterm highway bill we passed last year under the leadership of Senators INHOFE and BOXER. I am pleased that this bill includes a provision I offered to empower the State to designate a portion of Highway 67 in Arkansas. from North Little Rock to Walnut Ridge. as ""Future 157."" Arkansas has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build an interstatequality road. and we are now calling it what it is. The presence of an official interstate highway is one of the initial key factors that developers consider when determining where to make major investments such as building new factories. Community leaders along this stretch of road shared their excitement about the future designation. Buck Layne. executive director for the Searcy Regional Chamber of Commerce. says this will improve the transportation network and expand economic development opportunities. Jon Chadwell. executive director for the Newport Economic Development Commission. says this will open up opportunities to Arkansas business and give companies an even greater access to national and global markets. Walnut Ridge mayor Charles Snapp says this designation will open a lot of doors. and Walnut Ridge aldermen voted this week to support this designation. Resolutions of support for the 157 designation have been passed by the Newport Economic Development Commission. as well as the chambers of commerce in Bald Knob. Cabot. Jacksonville. Lawrence County. Newport. Sherwood. and Searcy. Other expressions of support will be received in communities throughout the central Arkansas and northeast Arkansas regions. This designation is an important step to make Arkansas a better connected State that is open for business. This bill also sets high priorities and provides critical funding through programs like community development block grants. These programs work because they allow decisions to be made at the local community level. I appreciate the efforts to make sure rural States like Arkansas are not left behind by housing and development programs. I compliment the chair and ranking member on working to address Member priorities under these programs. We are also jointly considering the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill. Senators KIRK and TESTER have worked very hard to put together a good package for the Senate to debate. Their bill funds the VA at record levels and invests in priorities such as veterans health care. benefit claims processing. the Board of Veterans Appeals. and the VA inspector general. as well as prosthetic research. It includes funding for projects to ensure military readiness and improve the quality of life for our military families. I grew up in a military family. and I have been honored to serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee since my first day in the House of Representatives. The needs of veterans are very important to me. and I am proud to support the work that Senator KIRK and Senator TESTER have done to provide funding for 2017. These are funding and policy priorities for both sides of the aisle. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation because it creates an environment that helps grow our economy. reins in spending. and takes care of our veterans. I yield the floor."
1140097023,Mr. President. today I wish to honor David Maxwell. the director of the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. ADEM. and State Homeland Security adviser. who is retiring next month after more than 36 years of service at ADEM. David began his career at ADEM in 1978 as a temporary housing employee working with Arkansans displaced by major flooding in Little Rock. Through the years. he held a number of positions at ADEM. including plans and operations division manager. where he ensured the State emergency operations plan. EOP. and local jurisdictional plans were maintained and in compliance with State and Federal guidelines. Prior to assuming the role of director. David served as the departments deputy director. As director. David chairs the Arkansas Homeland Security executive committee and serves on a number of the States emergency responserelated councils and committees. In October 2009. David served a 1year term as 2010 president of the National Emergency Management Association. NEMA. and now serves as an adviser to the current NEMA president. Additionally. he serves on the board of directors of the Central United States Earthquake Consortium. CUSEC. and is a member of the executive committee of the National Governors Association. NGA. Governors Homeland Security Advisors Council for which he chairs the catastrophic disaster and preparedness committee. In 2015. David was awarded the Lacy E. Suiter Distinguished Service Award by the National Emergency Management Association. David has served as the designated State coordinating officer for 24 federally declared disasters and one federally declared emergency during his career at ADEM. I worked very closely with David during his tenure as ADEM director. I have always found him to be a very responsive. committed public servant who is dedicated to the people of Arkansas. I thank David for his service to our State and applaud his efforts to keep Arkansans safe over the last three decades. I wish him all the best in retirement.O
1140099160,"Mr. President. the Federal Governments No. 1 responsibility is to protect the American people. As the Obama administration approaches its final months. the American people still do not feel. with any degree of confidence. that Washington is taking the proper steps to carry out that responsibility. The Islamic State terror group has repeatedly encouraged sympathizers in the West to launch domestic attacks. In the groups selfdeclared caliphate in Syria and Iraq. it continues to carry out atrocities on a daily basis. ISIS has no intention of letting up. and the Presidents strategy of scattered attacks is doing little to slow the terror groups strength. A group President Obama once dubbed the JV team has become a clear and serious threat during his watch. That is just one of the many failures during this administrations foreign policy which is rooted in wishful thinking rather than grounded in reality. The idea that we can wish away the Nations threats that our Nation faces by passively withdrawing from the international stage is a dangerous approach. It is this mentality that the President and his aides used to justify not calling jihadi attacks what they are. radical Islamic terrorism. The President has convinced himself that radical Islamic terrorism will not be a threat if we just call it something else. Clearly. this is not true. It is the same mindset that thinks closing Gitmo and moving dangerous terrorists to U.S. soil is the right thing to do. and it is how we ended up with a deal that does nothing to prevent Iran from going nuclear but instead emboldens it to belligerently threaten the United States. our allies like Israel. and its neighboring Arab States. The regime in Tehran acts as if it is virtually untouchable as a result of the Obama administrations agreement. Iran has no intentions of being a responsible. peaceful player in the international community. Even before the deals implementation. Iran shamelessly violated U.N. Security Council mandates. Now. free from sanctions. the Iranians are flush with resources to build an arsenal to fund terror across the region. None of this seems to matter to the White House. which was bent on making this deal the cornerstone of its foreign policy. The administration was so determined to sell this deal that it engaged in a propaganda campaign. enlisting outside groups to create an ""echo chamber"" and feeding material to a press corps that White House staffers said ""knew nothing"" about diplomacy. The administration even took extreme steps to keep the uncomfortable truths from the American people by removing a damaging exchange about whether officials lied about secret talks with Iran in 2012. All of this just adds to the perception that the Obama administration was willing to go to any length to get this deal done. no matter how bad it is for our national security. Senate Republicans have tried to correct this. of course. We wanted to stop this illadvised Iran deal. but the minority leader forced his caucus to protect the Presidents legacy. We have taken efforts to force the President to present a coherent plan to defeat ISIS abroad and to protect Americans here at home. That plan is still nonexistent. We have inserted language into law after law to prevent the closure of Gitmo. In fact. the President is once again threatening to veto the bill we are currently considering. in part. due to the language that prevents closure of the facility. We shouldnt be moving dangerous terrorists out of Gitmo. If anything. we should be moving more terrorists into Gitmo. The stateoftheart facility is more than serving its purpose for detaining the worst of the worst. obtaining valuable intelligence from them. and keeping these terrorists who are bent on destroying America from returning to the battlefield. A report from the Washington Post yesterday indicates that the Obama administration has evidence that about a dozen detainees released from Gitmo have launched attacks against the United States or allied forces in Afghanistan that have resulted in American deaths. As the threat posed by ISIS grows. Gitmo remains the only option to house these terrorists. Any facility on U.S. soil is not an option. It never was with Al Qaeda terrorists. nor can it be with ISIS terrorists. The President has failed to understand the gravity these terrorists pose to our homeland. Radical Islamic terrorists around the globe are pledging allegiance to the group and. as we have seen in Paris. Brussels. and San Bernardino. they are committed to and capable of hitting Westerners at home. The President has never presented a strategy to Congress for eliminating ISIS. and our sporadic airstrikes have done little to stop the group from pressing forward and attempting to strengthen its global reach. While ISIS grows and the United States sits idly by. Iran. Russia. China. and North Korea have ramped up their belligerent actions. putting our security at risk around the world. This will only continue to increase if we continue to chase the diplomacy to the point where it puts the safety of the American people at risk. to the point where any leverage the United States started with is gone. and to the point where we withdraw from conflicts with enemies because it is easier to allow someone else to fight the battle. We are trying to fix the problems created by the Obama administrations failures so we can restore the confidence of the American people that their government is working to protect them here and abroad. Passage of the bill before us this week is a good step in the right direction. I yield the floor."
1140101966,Mr. President. today I wish to honor Fort Smith School District superintendent Dr. Benny Gooden. who will retire at the end of June after a lifetime of dedication to education. Dr. Gooden has led the Fort Smith School District since 1986. and in those 30 years. he has proven himself to be a driving force in education at the local. State. and national level. He made a career out of helping students and creating a solid education. to pave the way for a successful future for them. During his 50 years in education. he always put students first and fought to ensure the community created opportunities in their best interest. Dr. Gooden has remarked to the School Superintendents Association that his best professional day was when Fort Smith voters approved a 20 percent tax increase to guarantee the districts financial stability. He has been recognized for his career as a school administrator earning the American Association of School Administrators Arkansas Superintendent of the Year award and was ranked in the top 100 Outstanding School Administrators in North America by Executive Educator magazine. He was named Administrator of the Year by the Arkansas PTA in 1995. received the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Outstanding Educator award from the National PTA in 1999. and a year later was the recipient of the Dr. Dan Pilkington Award by the Arkansas School Boards Association. These accolades are all well deserved. Dr. Gooden is actively engaged in the legislative process at the State and national levels on behalf of education. He has served as a member of the Executive Committee of the American Association of School Administrators and served as the organizations president from 20122103. Dr. Gooden has served his community. State. and Nation in a remarkable way in pursuit of better education opportunities for Arkansas students. He has been a resource for me over the years to keep up with the needs and challenges of our education system. Whether pursuing opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds. cheering the accomplishments of adult education graduates. or paving the way for advanced technology in the classroom. Dr. Goodens dedication to the young people of Fort Smith has made a positive impact on the community. Because of this. Fort Smith will continue to benefit from Dr. Goodens work long after his retirement. I congratulate Dr. Gooden for his outstanding achievements in his career and thank him for his dedication to education. students and the community. I appreciate his friendship and enjoyed supporting his efforts to improve education. I wish him all the best in retirement and know that his wife Martha and the rest of his family will enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with him.O
1140103087,"I thank the Presiding Officer. Mr. President. I will be brief. I wanted to come down to the floor. Right now we are in the midst of discussing a very important bill. the CommerceJusticeScience appropriations act. funding law enforcement. We all know that we are in troubled times. and we are trying to get things sorted out in that regard. So why take 45 minutes to come down and speak on the Senate floor about such an important subject as what is going on in the VA? Last week the Secretary of the VA decided that he would no longer support the expedited removal authority that we allowed him when we passed the Choice Act. There was a case and the Attorney General decided that she felt like it might be unconstitutional. So the Secretary of the VA took it upon himself to no longer use that authority. The way that I found out. and I think the way the rest of the members of the committee found out. was to read this in the press. The Secretary didnt have the courtesy to contact us and tell us what was going on. He arbitrarily decided it was unconstitutional. I voted for it. Most of the Members in this body voted it. Most of the Members of the House of Representatives voted for it. If I thought it was unconstitutional. I certainly would not have voted for itagain. acknowledging the duties of being a U.S. Senator. We passed it overwhelmingly and. as my colleague from Alaska has commented. the Secretary has set dangerous precedent by simply ignoring it. He went on to say on Monday that the accountability procedures we have had in place are working fine. If that is true. then why has the VA chronically had an issue with lackluster and negligent employees? He was very supportive of this authority until this case came up. In light of the VAs decision last week. it is even more imperative that this body move to pass the Veterans First Act. which will significantly improve accountability at the VA. This was a bipartisan. comprehensive initiative. The American Legion said: ""This legislation will shorten the grievance process. make it easier to dismiss VA officials that breach the trust of the veterans that they are supposed to serve."" For those of us on the committee. my only concern is that the Secretary at some point will decide this is unconstitutional and do his own thing. Again. this is such an important issue. It is something that the committee is working so hard on. but it is wrong. We have a situation now where we have employees who we know have abused their power. On the other hand. the vast majority of the people of the VAthe vast. vast majorityare hardworking and do a tremendous job. I am so proud of the VAs that I have in Arkansas. our facility in Little Rock. our facility in Fayetteville. There are no finer hospitals in the country. On the other hand. when people act up and they dont do what they are supposed to. we need to hold them accountable. We certainly need a Secretary of the VA who is more concerned about veterans than he is about labor issues. With that. I yield the floor."

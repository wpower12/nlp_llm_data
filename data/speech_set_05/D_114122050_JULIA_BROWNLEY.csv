1140011216,Mr. Chairman. my amendment. the Biliteracy Education Seal and Teaching Act. would amend H.R. 5 to encourage and incentivize bilingual education for our students across the country. Specifically. my amendment would establish a grant program at the Department of Education to provide resources for States to create or to expand State biliteracy seal programs to recognize high school seniors who achieve a high level of proficiency in writing. reading. and speaking in English and in a second language. Students who speak more than one language have a competitive edge in the American job market. As businesses look to expand into overseas markets and serve a wider range of customers and as the world becomes increasingly interconnected. the demand for students with valuable language skills is increasing. It is not only the private sector that needs young people with language skills. The Federal Government also has a direct and compelling interest in ensuring that our young people become proficient in foreign languages. Our military. our diplomats. and our intelligence agencies are increasingly seeking to recruit young people with proficiency in a foreign language. However. there are few State or national standards for bilingual certification for high school students. and many students who could qualify for the seal are not enrolled in AP or baccalaureate classes either because they cannot afford the cost of the test or their school does not offer advanced courses. whereas States that have or are in the process of implementing State seals do so free of charge for every student. I must add that eight States have already approved a bilingual seal. and three more are considering it as we speak. A biliteracy seal is a very special marker on a students high school diploma. It serves as a certification by the State that the student is fluent and literate in a language other than English. Under my amendment. these seals would be available to students who are proficient in any spoken languageArabic. Mandarin. Spanish. My amendment also makes nonspoken languages. like American Sign Language and braille. also eligible. To receive a seal. a high school senior must have a strong academic record in both English and a second language. and he must be on track to graduate. My amendment establishes a voluntary grant program which would not impose any new mandates on States. It is also budget neutral. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would not increase direct spending. I urge Members to vote for my amendment. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1140012756,Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer a simple. commonsense amendment to the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015. My amendment would require each State to develop a grade crossing action plan. identifying specific solutions for improving safety at railhighway crossings. furthermore. my amendment would direct States to focus resources on crossings that have experienced recent grade crossing accidents. multiple accidents. or crossings that are at high risk for accidents. Mr. Chairman. a week ago Tuesday. our Nation witnessed yet another tragic rail accident in my district when Metrolink Ventura County line 102 crashed into a truck along the train tracks in Oxnard. While there are many unanswered questions about this accident. one issue is abundantly clear. As a nation. we must do more to address railhighway crossing safety and address the increasing backlog of safety projects nationwide. Currently. California ranks second in the Nation in the number of crossing accidents. Nationally. the Federal Railroad Administration estimates that there were over 2.000 accidents at railroad crossings in 2013. with 251 fatalities and 929 injuries. As many residents of Ventura County know. this is not the first time an accident has occurred at the Rice Avenue intersection. This is a heavilyused corridor for both rail goods movement. passenger railboth Amtrak and Metrolinkas well as automobiles and truck traffic. Unfortunately. like many local communities across the Nation. Ventura County cannot. on its own. fund railhighway crossing safety improvements. As a member of this committee. I am pleased that this bill provides funds for passenger rail infrastructure. and I strongly support the provision that permits funds to be used for crossing safety improvements because we all know these investments benefit not only safety. but also our regional and national economies. In 2014. we invested $220 million in the RailwayHighway Crossings Program at the Federal level. yet. under title 49. only 10 States are required by Federal law to have action plans prioritizing railhighway safety improvements. It is critically important for Congress to ensure that Federal dollars for passenger rail infrastructure improvements are used wisely. We must also ensure that Federal funds are prioritized to address safety improvements at the most dangerous crossings first. My amendment would get at the heart of this issue by requiring every State to have a specific plan in place that will ensure both the wise use of tax dollars and address railhighway grade crossing safety in a systematic way. I ask my colleagues to vote for my commonsense amendment. Mr. Chair. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140021860,Mr. Chairman. I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment to H.R. 2029. My amendment would restore the funding for major construction projects in the Department of Veterans Affairs to $1.14 billion to meet the level that the VA has requested. As ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health. I share the outrage of many of my colleagues over the unacceptable mismanagement of the VAs major construction program. I agree that VA management must be held accountable for their failure to manage construction costs for the Denver hospital. Congress must reform the VA construction program so that it uses taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently. However. we cannot continue to ignore the sad state of disrepair in VA hospitals and clinics across our country which are in desperate need of funding for modernization and health and safety improvements. Most of the VAs medical infrastructure is old and outdated. The average building age is approaching 60 years. Many VA health facilities urgently need seismic retrofitting or emergency repairs. Others are too small to accommodate the growing population of veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan. and the aging population of veterans who served in Vietnam continues to put great stress on the VA. Many veterans in underserved communities like Ventura County are counting on us. on Congress. to ensure that new construction projects are delivered and that their health care needs will be met. The funding levels in the bill would delay VA plans to expand health care facilities in many locations. harming VAs ability to provide care to veterans. If the current funding level in this bill is made law. the VA would have to scuttle plans for a rehabilitative therapy building in St. Louis. Missouri. two outpatient clinics in Alameda and French Camp in California. and a community living center in Perry Point. Maryland. Delaying these projects is not the right way to honor our commitment to our Nations veterans. Mr. Chair. draconian funding cuts to the VAs major construction program are not the only way that veterans are being shortchanged in this bill before us today. The majoritys bill also fails to meet the administrations budget requests in other areas. including medical services. medical facilities. and information technology. For example. the VA estimates that at the bills current funding level. over 70.000 fewer veterans will receive medical care compared to the administrations request. In addition. the VA will not be able to pay for cemetery expansions in St. Louis. Portland. Riverside. Puerto Rico. and Pensacola. which would have enabled the Department to serve 18.000 veterans and their family members annually. Veteran advocates. including AMVETS. Disabled American Veterans. Paralyzed Veterans of America. and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. agree that. in the long run. Congress will be forced to appropriate much larger sums to enable the VA to catch up on the deficits being created by this bill. not only in capital infrastructure. but in critical investments in other VA services in health care. If we really want to change the culture of the VA and ensure that veterans everywhere can get the services and benefits they have earned. Congress must do its part by investing in our veterans. When Congress cuts corners. we put the health and wellbeing of the men and women who have served this country at risk. I realize. Mr. Chairman. that my amendment is subject to a point of order. so I intend to withdraw my amendment. but we must fix this bill before it moves forward. Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?
1140025228,"Madam Speaker. this is the final amendment to H.R. 36. which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. My amendment would ensure that nothing in the bill would prevent a woman from terminating her pregnancy after 20 weeks if her health were at risk. Only 1.1 percent of abortions performed in the United States occur after the 20week mark. These rare procedures are often the most medically difficult and dangerous cases where womenmany of whom want and have dreamed of being parentsare faced with impossible decisions. As it is written. H.R. 36 would force a doctor to wait until a condition becomes life threatening before performing an abortion. It shows no concern for the longterm health of the mother. her future ability to bear children. or her right to make her own medical decisions. It ignores that there are very real and very serious reasons why a woman may need an abortion later in pregnancy. For example. pregnant women with severe fetal anomalies or women whose amniotic sacs rupture prematurely and cannot support the fetus would be forced to give birth. The bill also treats doctors as criminals for providing care that has been the law of the land for 42 years. and it puts doctors safety at risk by requiring public disclosure of doctors who provide abortion care around the country. Both the American Medical Association and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists understand that there is no appropriate onesizefitsall solution. They oppose bills not based on sound science and that interfere with the physicians ability to provide the highest quality of care. H.R. 36 does more than endanger the health and lives of women. It also robs rape victims of their constitutionally protected right to choose. The bills revised rape exception continues to question rape victims honesty by requiring that adult rape victims obtain counseling or medical treatment 48 hours before obtaining an abortion and prohibits both services from being performed by a womans regular OB/GYN. By placing these onerous burdens on women. this bill revictimizes women who have already been traumatized and denies women the right to choose their own doctor. Further. many women. especially victims of abuse. do not report rape for fear of reprisal. The National Institute of Justice estimates that only 35 percent of women report rape. Forcing a survivor to report her sexual assault before she can terminate a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest denies her basic rights. If we are serious about reducing the number of abortions. we should improve access to birth control and family planning. we should support comprehensive sexual education. we should do anything but pass this misguided. misinformed. and illconceived legislation. Instead of bills that harm women. we should work together on bipartisan legislation to help women and families. including passing legislation that provides equal pay for equal work. access to child care. and paid family leave. We should also pass a transportation bill. fix our crumbling infrastructure. create jobs. and strengthen the economy. Backward bills. not based in science. that fail to respect a womans right to privacy and right to make her own health decisions have no place in local. State. or Federal legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on the motion to recommit. vote ""yes"" to protect womens health. vote ""yes"" for a womans right to choose. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140030315,Mr. Chairman. I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 2578. which would increase funding in Veterans Treatment Courts. Our Nations heroes are returning home from over a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan with the invisible wounds that come with multiple deployments in military service to our Nation. The signature wounds of these wars. posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. have led to a rise in mental health issues among our veterans. According to the National Center for PTSD. about 11 to 20 percent of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom have PTSD in a given year. Since 2005. the number of veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress has doubled. Too often. these mental health issues can severely impact a veterans lifefrom being able to keep a job. to drug abuse. to criminal activity in some circumstances. Instead of receiving the mental health services and support that they need. a growing number of veterans ends up being incarcerated in our justice system. My simple amendment would increase funds for Veterans Treatment Courts by $2.5 million. Veterans Treatment Courts are designed to give veterans with mental health and substance abuse issues and who find themselves in trouble with the law an opportunity to get the help they need while avoiding jail time. In my district. the Ventura County Veterans Treatment Court. which started as a pilot program in 2010. has helped dozens of veterans. Judge Colleen Toy White. one of the programs many champions in Ventura County. knows that the treatment courts reunite families and save lives. Rather than arresting and jailing veterans for a few days or weeks and then putting them back on the streets with nothing changed in their lives. the Ventura County collaborative court connects veterans to needed treatment and services. which may include mental health care. drug and alcohol treatment. vocational rehabilitation. or other life skill services and programs. The process begins with a guilty plea. an incourt meeting involving the veteran. his or her attorney. and a VA representative. I was very impressed with the care that the court officers and volunteers extended to our veterans who found themselves before the court. A recent success for the Ventura County Veterans Treatment Court is a young man who was an Active Duty marine. Before leaving the service in 2014. he had completed three combat tours in 12 years. He was arrested for two DUIs within 3 weeks. After 5 months of treatment. he still stands with his back against the wall rather than taking a seat in court. It is a common sign in combat veterans. but he is now getting evaluated by VA. is going to treatment. and has hope once again. Since the Veterans Treatment Court program began in 2008 in Buffalo. New York. over 220 Veterans Treatment Courts have been established across the United States. and many more are being planned. I believe we need to increase Federal resources to these critical programs nationwide. which is what my amendment seeks to accomplish. It is our obligation to ensure our veterans receive the appropriate attention to their needs and that we do whatever we can to help them transition to an independent civilian life. I strongly urge my colleagues to support my amendment to provide veterans who are in trouble with the resources they need to help them secure a strong future. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140031497,"Mr. Speaker. this is the final amendment to H.R. 2578. which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. My amendment would provide an additional $3 million for Violence Against Women prevention and prosecution programs. increasing resources for sexual assault victims assistance. My amendment would also provide an additional $3 million for Juvenile Justice programs. directed to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force program. Mr. Speaker. there is more than ample room within the budget cap for this bill to do more to help sexual assault victims and prevent the exploitation of children. I hope we can all agree that these critical programs are worthy of added resources. The Sexual Assault Services Program was authorized through the Violence Against Women Act and was the first Federal program dedicated to the provision of direct services to victims of sexual violence. Across the country. the Sexual Assault Services Program supports critical. lifesaving. safety net services. Support services are offered to both adult and minor survivors of sexual assault and to family members who are helping them cope with the mental health issues and physical trauma of sexual assault. The program also funds intervention and advocacy services. providing survivors with the help that they need to navigate through the medical and criminal justice systems. For many survivors of sexual assault. this program is a critical and necessary source of support at the most vulnerable time in their lives. We must support these lifesaving programs and stand up for survivors of sexual assault. Additionally. we must do more to protect vulnerable children from predators who despicably exploit children on the Internet. That is why my amendment will provide a muchneeded increase for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force program. which funds State and local law enforcement who investigate online child exploitation. The program also provides forensic. prevention. and investigative assistance to law enforcement. educators. prosecutors. and families. The program also ensures law enforcement officers are trained to deal with online child pornography and child enticement so that these cases will be fully investigated and prosecuted. In 2014 alone. 7.800 individuals were arrested. and the task forces around the country conducted over 60.000 forensic investigations. Clearly there is an urgent and compelling moral need to address these heinous crimes. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on the motion to recommit. to vote ""yes"" to protect women and girls from sexual assault and violence. to vote ""yes"" to protect children from online predators. Mr. Speaker. at this time. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida . my friend who is a champion in protecting children."
1140060400,Madam Chair. I would like to begin by thanking the chairmen and ranking members of the full committee and the subcommittee for their work on this bipartisan bill. I worked very hard to become a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee because I wanted very much to be part of a team that gets things done. When I first joined the committee. many of my constituents back in Ventura County questioned whether the 114th Congress could get a surface transportation bill through the House. The progress that we have made so far on the bill is a testament to the good work that Congress can do when we work together in a bipartisan way. through the committee process. to get things done for the American people. I am also very appreciative of the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order this evening. Madam Chair. my amendment would fix a small problem with the new freight program and would allow smalland midsized communities an opportunity to compete for a slightly larger piece of the pie. I agree with many of my colleagues that we absolutely must address capacity issues along longhaul routes and freight corridors. We must address the costly and timeconsuming bottlenecks within congested metropolitan areas. We must also address the first- and lastmile connections to our ports. freight yards. and other job centers in our communities. However. Madam Chair. I am concerned that the freight program created in this bill includes a minimum project threshold of $100 million. Let me repeat: $100 million is the minimum threshold. Many of us represent smalland midsized communities. In my district of Ventura County. we have struggled over the past few years to address freight bottlenecks in our community. including along Rice Avenue. where we have seen far too many deadly accidents in recent years. But as this bill is currently drafted. Ventura County and many other smalland midsized communities across the country wont be able to fully compete for the freight program. We just dont have the resources back home to compete with these large projects. But that doesnt mean that we dont have freight bottlenecks. All that I am seeking is to ensure that small- and midsized communities like my county. Ventura County. can better compete. Madam Chairman. my simple amendment would increase the small project setaside from 10 percent to 20 percent of the available resources to allow more communities across the country to compete for these limited resources. The small project threshold is $5 million or more. My amendment will still leave 80 percent of the money for larger projects. Increasing the small project setaside will not guarantee funds for any specific project. but it will give many of our districts at least a fighting chance to compete for onefifth of the funds under the new freight program. Madam Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140075991,"Mr. Speaker. first I would like to thank Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member BROWN for their help in moving the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act forward. I would also like to recognize my colleague from Arizona whose bill honoring the memory of her constituent. Army veteran Sergeant Daniel Somers. has been included. Mr. Speaker. as you know. the women veteran population is more than 2 million and growing quickly. But our understanding of the experience of women in the military and women veterans is not keeping pace with this rapidly changing demographic. We agree that one of the most pressing and immediate issues we must address. as Members of Congress. is the tragic epidemic of suicide among all of our veterans. Last year Congress passed the Clay Hunt SAV Act. which required the VA to conduct annual evaluations of its suicide prevention and mental health programs. I am confident that the Clay Hunt bill will save lives. But recently researchers analyzed data from 23 States and the Suicide Repository on more than 170.000 suicides over a 10year period. These researchers found data suggesting that female veteran suicide follows very different patterns than male veteran suicide. The statistics are extremely startling. Suicide among women veterans increased by an astounding 40 percent from 2000 to 2010. The suicide rate among veteran women is nearly six times higher than among nonveteran women. For women ages 18 to 29. the risk of suicide is even higher. at nearly 12 times the rate of nonveteran women. We dont know whether the reasons are related to the high rate of military sexual assault. genderspecific experiences on the battlefield. or factors that distinguish differing personal backgrounds. which is exactly the point. Without looking more closely at the root causes. we cannot hope to find better solutions. Last year the Los Angeles Times wrote about this issue describing the heartbreaking case of Army medic Sara Leatherman. Even before her deployment. Sara had experienced depression and attempted suicide. She was discharged early from her deployment because of a back injury sustained in Iraq. Suffering from posttraumatic stress and experiencing physical pain from her injury. Sara was not able to live by herself and moved in with her grandmother. Sara was trying to get her life back on track and was attending community college. Although Sara was receiving VA treatment for PTSD. at the very young age of 24. she tragically took her life. Her family has been utterly destroyed by their loss. While so very distressing. the VA was unable to help Sara. So we must honor Saras memory and the memory of other women veterans whom we so tragically lost to suicide by doing our very best to better understand the underlying and unique causes that lead women veterans to take their lives over wanting to live their lives. I introduced the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act to do just that by building upon and improving the Clay Hunt SAV Act. My bill will help identify the different mental health and suicide prevention programs that are most effective for either male or female veterans. My bill will also require the VA to report to Congress annually on the results of this analysis. Finally. my bill will require that VAs evaluation of its suicide prevention programs include specific performance metrics for women veterans. The Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act passed the House Veterans Affairs Committee proudly with bipartisan support. It is also supported by the Service Womens Action Network. The American Legion. the Military Order of the Purple Heart. Disabled American Veterans. Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Veterans of Foreign Wars. Paralyzed Veterans of America. and the Vietnam Veterans of America. Mr. Speaker. this bill will give us more tools in the toolbox to help save the lives of men and women who have bravely served our country with great honor and distinction. One human life unnecessarily lost is one life too many. I thank my colleagues on the committee for making the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act a priority. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting ""yes"" on this important legislation."
1140090606,Mr. Chairman. I rise to offer a very straightforward amendment to H.R. The amendment would include the Office of Womens Health in the interagency task force created under the bill. As we all know. the underlying bill includes a list of Federal agency representatives to be included in the interagency task force. which will review. modify. and update best practices for pain management and prescribing pain medication. However. the bill does not currently include the Office of Womens Health. The Office of Womens Health. within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. was established in 1991 to improve the health of women by advancing and coordinating a comprehensive womens health agenda to address healthcare prevention and service delivery. The Office of Womens Health works with numerous government agencies. nonprofit organizations. consumer groups. and associations of healthcare professionals to coordinate and advance policies and programs that best meet the unique healthcare needs of women. [ 1415 As a national leader in the health of women and girls. the Office of Womens Health has critical specialized expertise that will help the interagency pain management task force address the unique pain management needs of women who may be pregnant or who may be nursing. This expertise is desperately needed because opioid abuse among women has increased substantially in recent years. In fact. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. the number of women who fall victim to an opioidrelated fatality increased an alarming 400 percent from 1999 to 2010. totalling 48.000 women who have died during that span of time. During this decade. opioid abuse among women increased more than abuse of any other drug. including cocaine and heroin. Shockingly. the CDC reports that in 2010. 18 women per day died of a prescription painkiller overdose. accounting for nearly 7.000 women in total. It is critically important that we include experts on womens health in the opioid task force. Women who are pregnant or who may be nursing have specialized healthcare needs. and the Office of Womens Health is uniquely qualified to ensure that the interagency task force takes the needs of women and girls into account as it examines best practices for pain management in prescribing pain medication. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.

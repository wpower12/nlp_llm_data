1140012104,Madam Speaker. on Tuesday. Israels Prime Minister will make a direct appeal to the American people. His plea will not be made in front of cameras at a press conference. They will not be made from his home country 6.000 miles away. Tomorrow morning. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will stand right here behind me at this podium to address this Congress. The Prime Minister will speak before us to directly petition Congress and the American people because. sadly. he has. like so many. lost faith in the abilities of our Commander in Chief. The Prime Minister has lost faith in an administration whose foreign policy summarized the Presidents guiding advice: Dont do stupid stuff. He no longer trusts this American President. whose aids slander his name to the press. He is skeptical about the State Departments trust above all else policy with Iran. whose leaders have publicly proclaimed their desire for Israel to be wiped off the map. He regrets the Presidents inability to outright condemn Hamas. a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. without blaming Israel in the same sentence. Mr. Netanyahu has rightly questioned Americas once unwavering commitment to his homeland. IsraelIsrael. our partner. our ally. but most importantly. our friend. Madam Speaker. we have responsibilityno. we have a commitmentto watch over and protect our greatest advocate in the Middle East. To my colleagues in this body that do not believe in the United States moral obligation to watch over Israel. I remind them about the United States strategic obligation. Israels interests are closely aligned with ours. Israel benefits from a secure America. just as America benefits in having a secure. stable. and trustworthy ally in a very volatile. dangerous region. Despite my personal beliefs that America has a moral obligation to ensure Israels peace and prosperity. I cannot disregard the obvious strategic benefits our relationship has brought us. The Obama administrations inability to realize this twofold bond between the United States and Israel illustrates how out of touch they really are. Mr. Prime Minister. I welcome you to the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives. Mr. President. you and your supporters who refuse to meet with our friend. I must remind you of your foreign policy advice. Simply. you said: Dont do stupid stuff. In God we trust.
1140018893,Thank you. Congressman DOLD. Mr. Speaker. I wish to discuss an important matter that we have heard tonight and talk a little bit about it more. that impacts both my home State of Texas and. as we have heard already. the Nation. Nuclear power is a clean. efficient. and virtually inexhaustible fuel source. Many people rely on it. In fact. in Somerville County. Texas. Comanche Peak is a nuclear power plant that generates enough power to supply about 1.15 million homes in normal conditions and 460.000 homes in periods of peak demand. Nuclear waste. however. must be isolated for tens of thousands of years to safely degrade. Yucca Mountainwe have talked a lot about it tonightis the official Federal nuclear waste repository and is the law of the land under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The Department of Energy has concluded that the repository would have little to no adverse impact on future populations or the environment. yet President Obama and HARRY REID effectively have delayed the Yucca program in 2009 without proposing any kind of alternative energy or energy strategy. Now. like many other nuclear power plants across the United States. Comanche Peak in my district has been paying dues for storing waste. which some think could be as much as $30 billion which. of course. is simply passed on to its customers. That is what always happens. Nuclear waste in our communities poses an environmental risk. a terrorism risk. and prevents communities from redeveloping the property. The facility at Yucca Mountain represents our best option to dispose of spent nuclear fuel in a safe. environmentally friendly. and secure way for centuries to come. Now. if we fail to act. we will continue to spend billions of dollars storing nuclear waste in a way that ultimately leaves our communities vulnerable to environmental disaster or terrorism. We cannot punt this problem to future generations. We have a habit of doing that. We need to find a solution. and we need to find that solution today. I believe we need the Federal Government to quit breaking promises to the American people.
1140022661,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to discuss a matter that is. frankly. getting out of hand. It is more than a matter. it is a problem. This is a problem that has expanded beyond the borders of individual American cities and into the international spotlight. It is a problem that is no longer a localized issue. but a national one that is spiraling out of control. This week. we watched in horror as Baltimore burned. We watched in disgust as lowlifes destroyed their own communities as local government helplessly stood by. We watched in anger that some could even think to justify this sort of behavior. I applaud President Obama for calling those responsible for the destruction who they really are. criminals and thugs. Mr. Speaker. everyone has the right to participate in peaceful demonstrations. and I thank and respect those in Baltimore who exercised their constitutionally granted right. but. when the actions of a few infringe on the rights of others. we have a problem. When the actions of a few violent protesters dominate the 24hour news cycle. it takes away from the importance of the message. and it tears apart already fragile communities. When businesses are trashed. those responsible must be brought to justice. When a national chain pharmacy is set aflame. we ask if they will ever risk doing business in that community ever again. As a businessowner. I can tell you. Mr. Speaker. it would take a whole lot of convincing to get me to invest my sweat. energy. and treasure in a city that has demonstrated the type of lawlessness we have seen in recent days. and that is a tragedy. It is a tragedy because these communities so desperately need structure. stability. support. and jobs. Mr. Speaker. it is law enforcement that will help reassure businesses that they will be able to safely operate in these communities. It is law enforcement that will reduce the risk that is currently holding back job creators from setting up shop. Mr. Speaker. communities must have law and order to succeed and prosper. I applaud those in law enforcement who have worked so hard to ensure that. In God we trust.
1140033372,"Mr. Speaker. on Monday. our Commander in Chief admitted that. in the fight against the Islamic State. the U.S. does not have ""a complete strategy."" It is hard to believe that it has been 1 year since the Islamic State of Iraq and SyriaISIS. ISIL. or whatever you want to call thembegan making headlines in American newspapers. It is hard to believe that it has been nearly 11/2 years since the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that it was ""likely ISIL will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria."" But it goes back even farther. In January 2014. the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq said the Islamic State is ""capable of taking and holding ground and causing a lot of trouble."" In November 2013. a State Department official testified before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee and specifically cited the ineffectiveness of Iraqs military. Then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran said: ""ISIL has benefited from a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of Iraqi security forces."" Mr. Speaker. all of these warnings occurred after Iraqs Prime Minister made an appeal to President Obama to help defeat the growing threat to his country. That was 2 years ago. so here we are. In June 2015. the leader of the free world tells an international conference in Austria that the United States does not have a complete strategy to defeat an enemy he once called a JV squad. Well. that JV squad is responsible for the horrific murders of American citizens. That JV squad has overtaken territory fought so hard for by American troops. territory that nearly 4.500 American servicemen and -women died to protect in the most violent battles witnessed by U.S. troops since the Vietnam war. That JV squad waves black flags while driving stolen military equipment through streets where Americans made the ultimate sacrifice. From overlooked redlines to bypassed deadlines. the Obama administration will serve as a case study in how not to conduct foreign policy for future world leaders. Today. the President wants us to believe that his administrations negotiations with Iran are in Israels best interests. Ironically. Israels Prime Minister made a direct appeal to the American people expressing the contrary. This past March. Prime Minister Netanyahu petitioned Congress from the podium right behind me because he. like so many. has lost faith in the abilities of our Commander in Chief. He is right. he is right to be skeptical about the State Departments ""trust above all else"" policy with Iran. whose leaders have publicly proclaimed their desire for Israel to be wiped off the map. Mr. Netanyahu has rightly questioned Americas once unwavering commitment to his homeland. Israelour partner. our ally. but. most importantly. our friend. As I have said before. for those who do not believe in the United States moral obligation to protect Israel. I remind them about the United States strategic obligation. Israel benefits from a secure America. just as America benefits in having a secure. stable. and trustworthy ally in a very volatile and dangerous region of the world. The Obama administrations inability to realize this twofold bond between the United States and Israel illustrates their lack of understanding. I suggest to the President and his advisers that. if they really want to salvage any remaining trace of foreign policy competence for their history books. they walk away from this deal. I urge our President to pause and reflect on Americas role in the world. Mr. Speaker. I urge him to reassess our courses of action abroad. The President must start by determining what is important for America. Only then will he be capable of developing a strategy. let alone the right one. In God we trust."
1140034430,"Mr. Speaker. up until several weeks ago. my State of Texas experienced a drought so severe that water levels were reduced to historic lows while conservation efforts were set to alltime highs. Lakes and reservoirs were bone dry. Wildfires were a constant threat. In a cruel twist of fate. Texas is now recovering from the worst flooding in recent memory. Rivers overflowed. and dams burst. In Wimberley. Texas. a town about 40 miles southwest of the Texas capital. water rushed over the banks of the Blanco River with enough force to rip houses off their foundations and carry cars like they were toys. Loved ones were lost. Belongings and memories were washed away. The last month has been marked by death. destruction. and disbelief. I have met with first responders. toured flood damage. and spoke to the National Guard and regional FEMA officers about response and recovery operations. My office established a response center in town to help with the recovery process. Although we are still in a period of mourning. the strong Texas spirit of resolve has proven more powerful than Mother Natures fury. Just this week. a nearby newspaper ran the headline. ""Hard hit by flood. Wimberley assures tourists: Were open for business."" I personally might add ""wide open for business."" Mr. Speaker. this is the Texas way. it is what we do. Today. just a few weeks since the rains eased and the floodwaters subsided. Wimberley is making a comeback. Nearly all of the businesses in downtown Wimberley have reopened. Cathy Moreman. the executive director of the Wimberley Valley Chamber of Commerce. told my office they have had offers of help from around the country. Locals and visitors alike have come in and out and offered much in help from rescue to cleanup efforts. She said the outpouring of support has been astounding. Mr. Speaker. this is what I mean when I cite the Texas spirit of resolve. We have and will continue to take care of each other. look out for our neighbors. and together push forward. I assure you. we will rebound from this tragedy quickly and fully. May God bless the residents of Wimberley. and may God bless all of Texas. In God we trust."
1140044325,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for your leadership. Before I begin. I would just like to say. I am a smallbusiness owner. I have owned my own business for 44 years. I have been through a lot. I have been through dollar gasoline. I have been through 20 percent interest. where I borrowed money. I have been through the slowdown in 1988. I have been through 9111. and I must tell you. the economy that we are in now. Main Street America is hurting like I have never seen it hurt before. That is why I am up here to talk about this situation that we seem to honor tonight. DoddFrank. I join the chairman and my other colleagues here tonight to speak on what I believe is one of the most impulsive. deceiving. and unAmerican pieces of legislation that has ever been passed through this body. What I am talking about is a 2.300page law that has unfairly blanketed our entire financial system with more than 400 costly rules and regulations. Just as we have found out that the Affordable Care Act is not affordable. we are learning that DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act doesnt do what its name suggests. I believe we probably need a government protection act. Now. DoddFrank is hammering small town America as we have talked about. and I mean like I have never seen before in 44 years. Small town America. Main Street America is hurting. They are hurting with unnecessary but very expensive compliance measures that are hard to meet. As a smallbusiness owner. as I have said. of over 40 years. I can say firsthand that DoddFrank is driving Main Street job creators and community banks and credit unions out of business. Yesterday in our oped. Congressman RANDY NEUGEBAUER and I wrote that the American people were fooled into believing DoddFrank was necessary to ensure financial stability and prevent future market meltdowns. But instead of responsibly studying the root causes of the financial crisis. Democrats in Washington rushed to regulate. In my home State of Texas. one of the healthiest economies in the Nation. 115 banks have closed their doors. These banks are far from the major financial institutions in New York. They are small town community lenders that cannot pull together resources to comply with DoddFrank. They are community banks and credit unions that issue 51 percent of all business loans under $1 million. The crippling effects of DoddFrank have trickled down from the Presidents pen to local job creators who had nothing to do with the financial crisis. The costs have been passed along to them. It isnt right. and it is not fair. DoddFrank is another example of how this administration discourages growth. Under President Obama and his administration. the risk of running a business is no longer worth the possible reward. and that is a big problem. This is America. Bad policies like DoddFrank are the product of lawmakers who have little to no business experience. They havent worked on payrolls. they havent met a payroll. they havent counted inventory. they havent met with employees that need personal help. they havent put people to work. but they have done something: issue 153 new regulations. 87 compliance changes. and 59 annual adjustments to thresholds. At what price. we ask. The Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office have both estimated that DoddFrank costs $3 billion to implement and will result in nearly $27 billion in private sector fees. assessments. and premiums. We simply cant afford this. For this reason. I have introduced legislation that will loosen DoddFranks choke hold on small businesses and Main Street America. The Community Financial Institution Exemption Act will require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to explain to Main Street lenders why they are not exempted from certain CFPB rules and regulations. as permitted. My bill has the support of the Independent Bankers Association of Texas. the Texas Credit Union Association. the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. and the Credit Union National Association. I ask all my colleagues to support my efforts. It is time we stopped punishing those who put their livelihoods on the line to realize the American Dream and not the American scheme. In God we trust.
1140061385,"Madam Chair. I am a secondgeneration auto dealer. I have been in the industry for most of my life. I know it well. As such. my oneword amendment will fix Senate language that puts unintentional new burdens on all rental car establishments. My amendment will clarify the Senate language so it only applies to actual rental car companies. like it is supposed to. The definition in the underlying bill. which the House never passed. is so broad that it sweeps up dealers who offer loaner vehicles or rentals as a convenience for their customers. My amendment leaves the regulations on all rental car companies. which compromise 99 percent of the market. intact. The Senate language is flawed because it simply is not tailored to small business. For example. under the bill. vehicles would be grounded for weeks or months for such minor compliance matters as an airbag warning sticker that might peel off the sun visor or an incorrect phone number printed in the owners manual. The regulations in this bill are not proportionate. Another problem is that this bill favors multinational rental car companies at the expense of small businesses. This bill will regulate a smallbusiness dealer with a fleet of five loaner vehicles the same way it would regulate a massive rental car company with hundreds of thousands of vehicles in their fleet. The bill even allows large rental car companies additional compliance time. which further disadvantages small businesses. Madam Chair. large businesses have regulatory and legal staffs available onhand to help with this burden. and they have the capital to pay millions of dollars in regulatory compliance costs. The average smallbusiness owner. however. is his or her own legal and regulatory staff. Without my amendment. this bill would impose new government inspections. additional recordkeeping requirements. and new penalties up to $15 million on small businesses. The Senate bill also gives the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the authority to add more regulatory burdens as appropriate. and that is too openended. Without my amendment. this bill could make it impractical for smallbusiness dealers to provide loaner or rental cars to their customers because it mandates vehicles be grounded for minor compliance matters with a minimal impact on safety. and that is not what Congress intent is or should be. Madam Chair. in tax law. employment law. and other areas. Congress has recognized the difference between big business and small business. Lets not regulate our Main Street businesses like multinational corporations. Frankly. Main Street is hurting enough as it is. Vote ""yes"" on the Williams amendment. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140074384,I thank the chairman. Mr. Chairman. I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 3700. the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2015. Introduced by my good friend Chairman LUETKEMEYER and my friend Congressman CLEAVER. this bipartisan piece of legislation is the first step in many to help reform and modernize our outdated Federal housing system. Mr. Chairman. for too long. government red tape has made many of these housing programs inefficient and ineffective. hurting the very people they aim to support. If signed into law. H.R. 3700 would seek to change that. all the while saving taxpayerinvested money. First. as mentioned. the CBO projects this bill to be a cost saver. With the Federal deficit reaching almost $19 trillion. the savings in discretionary spending are a direct result of allowing local housing officials and agencies to better manage their programs. Like most Federal programs. inefficient regulations exist that often balloon overall costs. Additionally. as previously mentioned. for the first time in 80 years of public housing policy. this legislation restricts the use of already scarce public housing units to those who actually need them by establishing an earnings cap. Eliminating Federal subsidies for overincome families has always been key to this discussion. While most wait lists for public housing stretch into the tens of thousands. families who should not receive subsidies. in fact. often do. Plain and simple. public housing should be reserved for those who are most in need. Finally. H.R. 3700 ensures that our veterans have fair access to HUD housing and homeless assistance programs. With nearly 50.000 homeless vets nationwide. we can and need to do more in this area. Mr. Chairman. as a member of the House Committee on Financial Services and of the House Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance. I thank Chairman LUETKEMEYER for his leadership on this issue over the last year. as addressing housing reform is something that is not without controversy. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.
1140111257,and Rosa Whitfield in working with Mr. Gingrich. in working with Mr. Crane. in working with Republicans. and how the leadership not only was able to get their sides but to see how the African Diplomatic Corps actually became the strongest lobbying force that we have had in the Congress as they found themselves pioneers in dealing with our great country that they loved so much and really had no understanding of why they didnt seem to be on our agenda. With AGOA. we knew it was just the beginning. we knew it was an opportunity. We take pride in the success that it has had. but we also know how far they had to come from behind. This enhancement piece of legislation has a lot of fancy words. but it sends out words to our embassies that this is American foreign policy. You dont just read the words. Make it work. Whether it is with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. whether it is with AID. whether it is giving information. whether it is helping them out. whether it is teaching them to learn. it is bringing them into the international trade. And what does it do? Is this a bill that just helped people in Africa escape poverty and disease? No. It helps the United States. and it helps the world. It helps people to be able to trade with each other. to talk with each other. to understand each other. and have compassion for each other. What a wonderful opportunity it is for the United States of America to look at a country that is struggling to enjoy the things that we believe in. to find out that now they dont have to lobby for it. Republicans and Democrats want what is best for the United States of America. and the developing countries in Africa need us so badly. There are a lot of reasons why I regret that I have to leave the Congress and retire to go back home. but knowing that I leave behind such people who are so dedicated. that are willing to go to the other party and give up a lot of their capital to make certain that the small countries in Africa appreciate the fact that we consider them an important part not only of our trade policy. our foreign policy. but. indeed. the policy of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker. I thank Ms. BASS for the opportunity to express myself on this most important issue. And I thank JIM MCDERMOTT. who will be leavingI dont know whether he is going back to Africa. but he wont be going back as a Peace Corps volunteer. I will tell you that. I thank him for his friendship.

1130014830,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker. our Framers were visionaries. They had the foresight to not only establish constitutional principles and processes that address the challenges of their day. but that still sustain and guide this country 230plus years later. Now. I dont think theres any question that this particular government. this Federal Government. has gotten away from proven and timetested processes required by our Constitution and has stretched constitutional authority to its limits. Were operating under continuing resolutions. That seems to be normal today. Weve submitted budgets that are now over 2 months late. And we have taken other steps. right here in these Halls. that have served to usurp the rights that belong to our States. Doing so has left us vulnerable. Mr. Speaker. to rulings like the D.C. Court of Appeals ruling on February 8 that said that the Presidents recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were unconstitutional. Now. like my friends on the other side of the aisle. and like you. Mr. Speaker. we have all raised our hand and said that were going to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies. foreign and domestic. and you know the rest. Weve all taken that oath. The Noel Canning decision holds the Presidents recess appointments are in direct contradiction to what the Framers outlined in article II. section 2. clause 2 of the Constitution. And. as a result of the ruling. each decision made by that Board since that time has been called into question. Mr. Speaker. I. personally. dont have anything against the individuals who have been appointed to the NLRB. And its irrelevant whether I agree or disagree with the Boards rulings. My concerns are. and the concern of each and every Member of this House should be the fact that we continually push the limits of our Constitution. the checks and balances outlined in this sacred document. At its best. this Court of Appeals ruling provides uncertainty. and the last thing that this country. this economy needs is uncertainty. I recognize the weight of the decisions made on the interpretation of the Constitution. They are tough. It is no easy task. And thats why I dont think its unreasonable to press the pause button on the decisions emanating from this Board until we get a final ruling. It is irresponsible. in my strong opinion. not to. Thats why I appreciate my friend from Tennessee for authoring this legislation. I support it wholeheartedly and recommend its passage.
1130040854,Madam Chair. Im so pleased to hear my friend from Kentucky further discuss the true intent of what his amendment does. and respectfully. I recognize that. in order for the amendment to be made in order. it has to be written broadly. And because it was written broadly. there were concerns expressed by a number of people on both sides of the aisle about what an amendment written this way might do that would negatively affect a lot of the things that we presently do and have been doing for a long time in Egypt. I can speak personally to it because it was right after 9111. while commanding an infantry battalion in Arkansas with the Arkansas National Guard. that I was called to duty to lead a task force of infantry soldiers and other personnel of over 500 men and women to the Sinai in Egypt to become the U.S. battalion so that other forces of the 18th Airborne Corps could go prosecute missions elsewhere in support of the war on terror. The gunslingers of Arkansas distinguished themselves by going to the Sinai in Egypt on very short notice and executed that mission. the U.S. battalion in the South Sinai Peninsula that does the observe -andreport mission. consistent with all of the protocols that were established with the Treaty of Peace in 1979. In fact. our unit was there during the 20th anniversary of the MFO. Since that time. other State National Guard units have followed this mission and have been doing it consistentlyOregon. Oklahoma. and othersuntil. because of sequestration. the active component has accepted responsibility for that mission once again. So weve had a lot of our men and women across the country into the Sinai to do the mission of the MFO. On top of that. our country has had a number of exercises called Bright Star. which is. if not the largest. one of the largest military training exercises that takes place on a biennial basis. Now it didnt happen in 2011 because of unrest in Egypt. but my understanding is that Bright Star is certainly going to occur again. So it is our hope. and as I said. Im glad that my friend from Kentucky has further clarified the intent of his amendment. that it is not designed to affect the Multinational Forward Observer. nor is it designed to affect the training exercises that would happen with a Bright Star operation. nor does it affect what goes on with the Office of Military Cooperation or the Defense Attache program or. as he has indicated. our marine security to outposts in that region. So again. I am very. very pleased. and we can breathe a bit of a sigh of relief that there is no intent in here at all to abandon. Madam Chair. the Treaty of Peace that was famously signed in 1979. and everybody has the vivid reminder of that picture with Jimmy Carter in the middle and Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin signing over that peace treaty. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130069995,Madam Speaker. my thanks to the subcommittee chairman and to Chairman HENSARLING for shepherding this bill through committee and bringing it to the House floor. I. too. would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. particularly Representative HIMES. with whom I worked in the previous Congress on similar legislation that has already been articulated. and Representative DELANEY and Mrs. WAGNER for working with me on this bipartisan measure. As you know. Madam Speaker. we have been talking about jobs. The House has passed bill after bill to create a better environment for private sector growth and job creation. These conservative solutions would help create new jobs today. would make life for families better across the country. and would expand opportunity for everyone without expanding government. That is exactly what this bill. H.R. 801. does as well. and I am proud to rise and urge support for its passage. Small financial institutions are essential to the communities they serve. Their boards are made up of community leaders. Their employees are our neighbors. They sponsor Little League teams and softball leagues and support the United Way. On Friday nights. you see their logos on the scoreboards at high school football games. These institutions have a deep and abiding love for the towns that they serve. and our constituentssmall business owners. farmers. and hardworking Americansrely on them to meet payroll. to purchase equipment. or to buy a car or a home. Unfortunately. these institutions are coming under increased pressure from Washington. forcing them to spend more and more of their resources not to put capital into the community but to comply with onerous new regulations and requirementsrequirements intended for larger banksinstead of serving the needs of their communities. Our small community banks and savings and loan holding companies were not the cause of the financial crisis. and they should not be treated as though they were. That is why in the last Congress the House and Senate acted to eliminate some of these unnecessary burdens by passing the JOBS Act. Among other things. the bill raised the registration threshold for bank holdings companies from 500 to 2.000 shareholders and increased the deregistration threshold from 300 to 1.200 shareholders. better positioning banks to increase their business lending and. in turn. promote economic growth in our communities. Due to an oversight. the JOBS Act did not explicitly extend these new thresholds to savings and loan holding companies. As a sponsor of the original legislation. this wasnt our intent. and I supported report language in the House FY 2013 Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill clarifying that savings and loan holding companies should be treated in the same manner as bank and bank holding companies. Additionally. Representative HIMES and I wrote to SEC Chairman Schapiro to ask that the SEC use its authority to carry out our original intent. Unfortunately. Madam Speaker. we are still without a successful resolution to the problem. At a time when our economy is struggling. Congress must address the issue and ease the burdens on these institutions to allow them to deploy more of their capital throughout the communities they serve. H.R. 801 does this by correcting this oversight and ensuring that savings and loan holding companies are treated in the same manner as bank and bank holding companies. I urge my colleagues to support this jobcreating legislation.
1130106317,Mr. Chairman. thanks to my chairman of this very important subcommittee for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf and even a friendly gesture to my friend from New York down there. who reminds me. from time to time. about the Yankee dominance in baseball. It is great to have his association on this committee. Mr. Chairman. our subcommittee is aware of our Nations fiscal situation. and we closely evaluated the budget requests for the diverse group of agencies funded in this bill. We held numerous hearings. We listened to the agencies about their priorities and needs. We challenged them with tough questions that reflect the realities of the choices we. as appropriators. have to make on a daily basis. Using this information. Mr. Chairman. the subcommittee produced a bill that provides a little over $21 billion in total funding and sees to it that every agency funded under the bill can carry out its core functions. Take. for example. our Federal courts which. because of this bill. will have the resources they need to ensure that our courtrooms are safe and justice is served. or the Small Business Administration. which will be able to make entrepreneurs dreams become a reality. leading to new business. more jobs. thriving communities. and a 21st century economy with the funds that the agency receives through this legislation. Mr. Chairman. as Members of Congress. and especially as appropriators. we have an obligation to carefully steward each and every taxpayer dollar. and in this bill. transparency and accountability rule the day. In this bill. the CFPB. an agency that has operated in the shadows with unfettered power and no accountability. is brought under the appropriations process. Agencies. Mr. Chairman. that have violated the publics trust and misused taxpayer dollars. such as the GSA and the IRS. they are held accountable. As an example. the IRS budget is returned to below fiscal 2008 levels. ensuring the agency does not have extra funding to target Americans based on their political beliefs without hampering the IRS ability to enforce our Nations tax laws. In closing. Mr. Chairman. I commend the gentleman from Florida. Chairman CRENSHAW. and the subcommittee staff for producing a bill that is worthy of this Chambers support. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

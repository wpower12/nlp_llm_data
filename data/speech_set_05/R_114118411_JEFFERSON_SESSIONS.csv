1140006033,Mr. President. today I honor the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Coast Guard. officially established on this day. January 28. 1915. when President Woodrow Wilson signed legislation merging the Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. LifeSaving Service into one organization. The Coast Guard has a long and noble history. dating back to 1790. of defending the shores of our Nation. It remains a vital component of our national security infrastructureperforming law enforcement. lifesaving. and military duties. Whether it is intercepting drug smugglers in the Gulf of Mexico or rescuing stranded fishermen off the coast of Alaska. the Coast Guard always answers the call and performs its mission bravely. Our Nation is safer thanks to the work done by the brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard. I am honored that my home State of Alabama has a significant Coast Guard presence in the city of Mobile. U.S. Coast Guard Sector Mobile is home to over 200 ActiveDuty military and civilian personnel who play a crucial role in enforcing our Nations laws and providing maritime security along the gulf coast of Alabama. Mississippi. and Florida. Mobile is also home to one of the Coast Guards largest units. the U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center. The Aviation Training Center is home to roughly 600 ActiveDuty military and civilian personnel. and it serves as the Coast Guards aviation and capabilities development centerresponsible for training Coast Guard pilots. It also serves as an operational Coast Guard air station. performing traditional Coast Guard aviation missions such as search and rescue. homeland security. and environmental protection in an area encompassing the Gulf of Mexico from the LouisianaTexas border to the Florida panhandle. I am proud of what these Coast Guard installations do to protect the people of the gulf coast and the Nation as a whole. I would like to thank the U.S. Coast Guard for everything it does to enhance and ensure the national security of the United States. and I congratulate and honor the Coast Guard on its 100th anniversary.
1140007133,"Mr. President. I thank Senator GRASSLEY for his remarks. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a longtime vigorous leader in the U.S. Senate. I know he was here and saw the problems of the 1986 amnesty. It had bad ramifications in a lot of ways. I believe if we listened to the experience of Senator GRASSLEY and his understanding of what is at stake. we would all be in a lot better shape than we are today. The American people want a lawful system of immigration. They want one that is fair to applicants who want to come to America. They are not for eliminating immigration to America. They want a system that allows people to apply. wait their turn. and if they are qualified. be admitted. if they dont qualify. not be admitted. They want that enforced. They dont believe we should have open borders and open visa programs that allow people by the millions to come unlawfully into this country. The President obviously has a different view. As a result. we are in a situation in which the Constitution is at stake in a lot of ways. We will vote after lunch on moving forward to the Department of Homeland Security bill. The Department of Homeland Security bill. passed by the House of Representatives. fully funds the Department of Homeland Security. The basic funding mechanisms and agreements and allocations of money in that legislation were approved on a bipartisan basis. The House of Representatives simply said: Mr. President. the money in the Department of Homeland Security funding mechanism will be spent for lawful purposes. That money will be spent to secure the homeland in an effective way. That money. however. will not be spent by anyone to take actions outside the lawful limitations and lawful powers of the Department of Homeland Security. But that is what the President wanted to do. and that is what he wants to do through his Executive action. They are now leasing a new building across the river in Crystal City. They are hiring 1.000 new Federal employees. Those Federal employees will be processing the applications for up to 5 million people and they will be providing those people with photo IDs. These are people in the country unlawfully. They are not lawfully allowed to work in America. Businesses arent allowed to hire people who are here unlawfully. It is plain and simple. They are not eligible to qualify for Social Security or Medicare. So the President has declared he is going to set up this office. They will process these individuals. and they will provide up to 5 million photo IDs. 5 million Social Security numbers. and the right to work in America. They will be allowed to participate in Social Security and Medicare. He says: I am entitled to do that. Well. he is not entitled to do that. As scholar after scholar and as common sense tells us. the President doesnt have that power. That is what this is about. The House barred any spending on this unlawful activityan activity the President asked Congress to allow him to do and which Congress rejected. This proposal was presented to Congress. and Congress refused to pass it. But he is doing it anyway. It is an arrogant overreach. a direct challenge to the historic role of Congress in our American system. Our Democratic colleagues say they dont want controversial immigration riders on this billcontroversial immigration riders. In other words. they dont want the Congress to do what it is required to dofund the programs it believes need to be funded and not fund programs it doesnt believe should be funded. As a matter of policy. Congress has not adopted and does not support what the President wants to do. In fact. it has prohibited it. It has no duty whatsoever to allow the President to spend moneys of the United States of America to advocate a program they dont approve of. or certainly one that is unlawful. That is what this is all about. Our colleagues are voting to block the bill that would fund Homeland Security at the level the President has asked for. So there is no policy change here. Every lawful activity of Homeland Security is funded. There was a headline in the New York Times today. I am going to push back a little on my colleagues because they have been spinning this idea that somehow the Republican House. in sending this legislation over that funded Homeland Security. is disrupting the fair flow and causing controversies within our funding mechanisms of Congress. The headline from an experienced reporters article in todays New York Times is: ""Democrats Look to Protect Obamas Immigration Directives."" That is exactly what this is about. colleagues. At least seven of our Democratic colleagues have explicitly said they dont agree with the policy of the President with regard to Executive amnesty and providing work permits and Social Security to people unlawfully here. But they are now united. We are told all of them are going to stand together to protect President Obamas immigration directives. When they were running for office during the campaign last fall. people were saying they didnt agree with him. Now. when the issue hits the floor and we have an opportunity to do the normal and rational thing and not fund an unlawful policy. they are all sticking together like a palace guard around the White House to protect Obamas immigration directives. This is a sad thing and a disappointing thing to me. The article goes on to say: Democrats are hoping they can force the new Republican majority to drop the immigration provisions and send the $40 billion spending bill to the President. Congress is spending $40 billion on homeland security. All of that money is directed to legitimate lawful policies of Homeland Security and not allowing any of it to be spent on unlawful. unapproved policies in Homeland Securityan absolute power that Congress has. a duty that it has. Congress is violating its fundamental duty if it allows the President to carry out power he is not authorized. It is absolutely violating its duty if it supports and funds actions by the President to violate the law. It has a duty to say no to the President who overreaches. The article goes on to say: But Democrats have decided to shut down debate on the measure altogether. fearful that it could lead to the bills approval and could prompt negotiations with the House that would put them at a disadvantage. Fearful that the process could lead to the bills approval during negotiations with the Houseisnt that what legislation is all about? Isnt that what it is all about? Shouldnt our colleagues have the right. if they dont like the language that constricts the Presidents power to carry on this unlawful act. to offer an amendment to strip it out? They have the ability to strike that language. Why dont they do that? No. they are blocking even moving to the bill in its entirety. Then they are attempting one of the most throughthelookingglass. downtherabbithole arguments you have ever heard. They are saying Republicans are shutting down Homeland Security when they are not passing the bill that is on the floor today and we will be voting on. They are rejecting it. All it does is fund the Department of Homeland Security at a level agreed upon on a bipartisan basis. $40 billion. What kind of world are we in when we do that? I would like to ask who is being protected here. The answer is clear. The New York Times said: They are protecting President Obamas political immigration directives. I would ask this. Isnt it our duty to protect the Constitution? Isnt it our duty to protect the laws of the United States of America? Isnt it our duty to protect American workers from the decline in wages and their job prospects as a result of now legalizing 5 million people to be able to take any job whatsoever in the entire American economy. including working for the county commission. the power company. the trucking companies? Isnt that what our duty is? Who should we be protecting here? Shouldnt we be protecting a lawful system of immigration? But the President wants to take money. He wants Congress to appropriate money to give him at Homeland Security so he can spend it to undermine the law of the United States of America. What an unthinkable thing that is. But that is fundamentally what is happening. He wants and is demanding that this Congress not follow its promises to the American peoplenot follow its lawful and constitutional dutybut to give him the money so he can carry out a policy in contradiction to the laws of the United States of America and to the good policy of America. This is the way we do business in this country. I think the reason our Democratic colleagues dont want to move to the bill is because they dont want to debate the substance of it. That is not a good reason. They dont want to debate the substance of it because their position is untenable. The American people understand that Congress is not shutting down the government and is not shutting down Homeland Security. Our Democratic colleagues are the ones that are refusing to pass the legislation that would fund Homeland Security. The President is backing them up and encouraging them. and apparently he has had success. He twisted arms or something because at least seven of the Members said they didnt agree with this. and more probably would have. had they been asked. But no. not now. Now they are all standing together with Senator REID. the minority leader of the Senate. to advocate this policy. I dont appreciate it being said time and again by so many of our Democratic colleagues and the President that somehow Congress is acting improperly and that Congress is not funding Homeland Security. This is through the looking glass. This is beyond acceptance. I think the New York Times pretty well said it correct. I dont believe the media is buying this argument. I dont think the American people are buying this argument. and Congress shouldnt buy the argument. The right thing to do. colleagues. is to get on the bill. Let me say this to my Democratic colleagues. I know many of you are uneasy about this. Lets get on the legislation. There will be amendments. There will be a number of amendments. Perhaps things could develop in a way that you can support them. We will protect the lawful constitutional powers of Congress and fund Homeland Security. We will do it in a way that strengthens the rule of law in America and strengthens our ability to have integrity in the immigration system. It creates a system the American people rightfully have demanded. pleaded for. and prayed for. and that Congress and the politicians have failed to produce for now over 40 years. That is the problem. The American people are angry. and they are not angry at immigrants. All of us have friends and relatives and neighbors who have immigrated to America. We are not against immigrants. I think there is a growing unease out there about the willful refusal of Congress to do what it takes to fix this system. I would just say one more thing. American wages are down. Wages fell in December 5 cents an hournot a good event after we have been told everything is getting so much better. There is a limit. colleagues. to how many people we can bring to America to take jobs when we have a limited number of jobs and falling wages. We have the lowest percentage of Americans in the workforce working today since the 1970s. Things arent going good. We cant accept everybody in the whole world to take jobs here. We just had a report produced yesterday that said we have now discovered there are another 5 million people who have beenit looks to meadmitted to work in the country unlawfully. Through the Freedom of Information Act. it was discovered that not only do we have a million people a year come to America with green cards and permanent residency. we have 700.000 guest workers that come every year. Add to that the asylees. plus the refugees and other people. What they found out was we have nowin the last 5 years under this administrationgiven work authorization to 5 million more people than anybody knew. Do we think this doesnt impact peoples wages. impact women to have a better job. their children to have a better job? Somebody needs to be thinking about this. There is a limit here. and it is obvious the limits need to be discussed. We need to create a lawful system which protects American workers. We need to be less concerned about protecting President Obamas unlawful directives and more concerned with protecting the interests of the American working person. I yield the floor."
1140007605,"Mr. President. we are in the odd situation by which our Democratic colleagues are complaining that we are blocking funding for the Department of Homeland Security when the House has passed a bill that fully funds the Department of Homeland Security. It is sitting at the desk today. The majority leader. Senator MCCONNELL. has moved to proceed to that bill. and they are blocking it. Senator MCCONNELL moved to invoke cloture on the motion to proceedto just get on the billand he has indicated. as he has before. that there would be amendments allowed to the bill. This would be the way to move forward with an appropriations bill in the regular order. So it is unbelievable. really. that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to contend that the majority Republicans in Congress. in both Houses. are trying to block funding from the Department of Homeland Security when nothing could be farther from the truth. Look at todays CNN headline. This is on their Web site: ""Democrats Block Funding for DHS to Protect Obamas Immigration Orders."" Why are they blocking it? To protect Obamas immigration orders that are contrary to Congresss will. clearly overwhelmingly rejected by the American people. and contrary to law. Why should Congress fund unlawful activities? Why should it fund policies it does not approve of? Why should it fund policies the American people strongly reject? It has no duty to do that. Congress is not a potted plant. It is not a rubberstamp. Congress has a duty to the people. which is to ensure that the laws of this country are followed. that the American people have defense for the homeland. with funding for the Department of Homeland Security. and they have done that. What they have said is we are not going to fund actions by the Department of Homeland Security that undermine the law. We are not going to approve money that undermines the laws of the United States. and we are not going to allow the President to take money. which was given to the Department of Homeland Security to enforce the law. so he can undermine the law. What has the President done with his Executive orders? It is a stunning action. He said over 20 times he didnt have the power to do this. He doesnt have the power to do what he did. He just did it because political pressure. I guess. caused him to do so. He is going to provide legal status. not for children. for 5 million people. They will be given Social Security numbers. Constitutional scholars have told us. colleagues. the utilization of the idea of prosecutorial discretion is not appropriate in such a massive way as this. What I want to tell you is it goes well beyond prosecutorial discretion. The President is going to provide a Social Security number to people who are unlawfully here. He is going to provide a photo ID for people who are unlawfully in America. providing work permits for them. the right to participate in the Medicare and the right to receive checks from the Federal Government in the form of earned income tax credit to the tune of billions of dollars. One of the first things we do to try to establish a lawful system of immigration is not provide financial benefit to people who come to the United States unlawfully. So this is a problem. I have to say it is a big problem. My friend and able Member of this Senate. Senator DURBIN. the Democratic whip. assistant minority leader. said this last night. yesterday: ""It is incredible to me that we have refused to provide funds the Department of Homeland Security needs to keep America safe."" He said: ""It is incredible to me that we havent passed a bill that the House sent over here that fully funds Homeland Security."" I am not blocking the bill. We want to go on the bill. We want to be able to amend the bill to keep America safe. Who is blocking it? It is my Democratic colleagues. Senator DURBIN is the leader of the blocking game. He is the offensive line. the center. I guess. of the offensive line. Senator DURBIN goes on to say: ""There is nothing wrong with a debate over immigration policy."" That is correct. He continues: ""In fact. the Republicans. now in the majority control of the House and Senate. could have started the debate weeks ago. They didnt."" Look. we debated Senator DURBINs vision. It was rejected by Congress. his ideas. Many supported the bill in this body. It didnt come back this fall in part because of their actions on immigration. President Obama had the choice to go from State to State trying to elect people to pass his immigration bill. but he either didnt do it or it didnt work. The American people do not want this kind of legislation. My friend Senator DURBIN said further: ""Instead. they attached five riders to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. and they said: We will not allow that Department to be properly funded unless the President accepts these five immigration riders."" This is just a normal bill that says how the money is going to be spent. It is going to be spent for enforcement. and we are not going to spend money to not enforce the law. It doesnt change. The bill the House has sent to us does not change one lawful immigration policy of America. not one. It is the President who adopted a radical new immigration policy contrary to law. contrary to the American peoples wishes. In fact. quite a number of Democrats urged him not to issue such an order. but he did it anyway. Congress has a duty. Senator DURBIN talks about the DREAM Act that he offered. It had a chance for passage a number of times. But every time it was carefully read. it was an overreach. It went too far. But the point of which is it was rejected by Congress. Congress didnt pass that. We need to be clear about who is objecting to what in this body. who wants to fund Homeland Security and who wants to advance a radical. unlawful. unpopular amnesty agenda the American people dont like. Yesterday on the floor Senator SCHUMER asked if it wasnt possible for the Senate to pass a Department of Homeland Security billwithout language that would ensure the President complies with the Constitution. of courseand then send it back to the House. Senator SCHUMER is one of our more able Members. for sure. in the Senate. and I respect him and his abilities. But the answer is this: The Housepassed DHS bill is the only vehicle because the House of Representatives would blueslip a bill that originates in the Senate. This is a basic tenet of how a bill becomes law. Article I. section 7. clause 1 of the Constitution states: All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives. but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills. Over the years. the House of Representatives has asserted. and successfully asserted. that this applied to revenue spending bills as well. According to the Congressional Research Service. as a result. the House customarily originates all ""money"" bills. including appropriations bills. The Congressional Research Service states: In practice. the Senate has generally deferred to the Houses insistence on originating appropriations. Indeed. it has generally deferred because they wont move anything that doesnt start over there. They successfully asserted that gray area to their benefit. and perhaps it is consistent with the Constitution. My staff has been unable to find a single instance where the House took up a Senateoriginated appropriations bill in over 100 years. since 1901."
1140007681,"Mr. President. the House of Representatives has voted to fully fund homeland security. as the President has requested. It sent a bill to the Senate that fully funds all the lawful policies and programs in homeland security. The bill will not deny a penny of funding. In fact. it says. spend the money. but on enforcing the laws of the United States. Dont spend money undermining the laws of the United States. Dont spend money in violation of the laws of the United States. Dont spend money in violation of the established policies of Congress. which rejected the Presidents ideas that he is now executing. And dont spend money in violation of the will of the American people who overwhelmingly oppose the Presidents unlawful Executive amnesty. That is what we are talking about today. and my colleagues continue to suggest that somehow Republicans are not funding the Homeland Security Department. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our colleagues have now voted to block going to the bill. If they dont like some of the provisions that came over from the House. well. lets get on the bill and lets have some relevant amendments and lets vote on it. That is what Congress is about. That is the way we are supposed to do business here. But our colleagues have gotten spoiled. They think they can block anything and turn around and blame the Republicans for it and that somehow everybody is going to agree with them. Look. the American people get this. The President is not entitled to spend money to implement a system of immigration that Congress. representing the American people. rejected. If our Democratic colleagues are unhappy. then. as I said. they can offer amendments. I feel it would be a stunning event if the Senate removes language from a bill that simply restores the separation of powers and prevents the President from overreaching in violating the Constitution. But if they want to bring up amendments that would allow the President to do this activity. lets do it. lets bring it up. and lets vote on it. Perhaps they might win it. But I think it is untenable constitutionally and it is untenable legally. because it is contrary to the law and the will of the American people. My good friend Senator SCHUMER is one of our able Members of this body. He spoke earlier today and he said: The right wing of the Republican Party is risking a DHSDepartment of Homeland Securityshutdown to get their way on immigration. They are saying: Take our hard right stance on immigration. or we wont fund national security. That is not so. Senator SCHUMER. Give me a break. Come on. You are blocking the bill. The House has voted to fund homeland security. It is on the floor. We need to pass it. and we will give you an opportunity to offer your amendments if you are not happy with it. It is absolutely not so that they are doing that. So how is it being reported? Republicans frequently complain they dont get fair reporting in the press. but lets look at this: U.S. News and World Report. today: ""Senate Democrats Block Bill Undoing Immigration Actions."" That is the headline. ""Undoing Immigration Actions."" Those are President Obamas unlawful actions. So they are defending his actions. not defending homeland security. How about this one. USA Today: ""Democrats again block efforts to derail immigration order."" The effort would derail the Presidents unlawful Executive amnestybut it funds homeland security. as the article makes clear. Fox News: ""Senate Dems nix debate on Homeland Security bill. blocking it. in protest over immigration."" Who is blocking the bill? Politico: ""Democrats filibuster Department of Homeland Security bill."" That is exactly what is happening. The bill has passed the House. It is on the floor. We are trying to bring it up. We are trying to have debate. We are trying to have amendments. And they are blocking the billaccording to Politico. no rightwing publication. The Washington Post: ""Senate Democrats block DHS spending bill targeting Obamas immigration actions."" The Atlantic. This is a good one. For those of us who have been around here a long time. and I think for reporters who cover it. this is really humorous. to have our Democratic colleagues. having complained for years about what Republicans do. This is the headline in the Atlantic: ""The New Democratic Obstructionists."" Here is the headline in the New York Times: ""Senate Democrats Block Republicans Homeland Security Bill."" So I would say. colleagues. the American people know better. The media knows better. They know who is blocking this bill. They know that the Congress of the United Statesthat the House of Representatives and the Senate is not required to fund any program it doesnt like. It is absolutely not required. and it has a duty not to fund Presidential expenditures that are illegal. The Department of Homeland Security is provided funds to enforce the laws of the United States. The President right now is taking money that was sent to Homeland Security to enforce laws and he is redirecting it and moving it over to a building just across the river in Crystal City. hiring 1.000 persons to process applications of people illegally in the country and to provide them the earnedincome tax credit. which is a direct check from the United States of America. provide them a Social Security number. the right to participate in Social Security. legal status in the country. the right to work in the country. and participation in Medicare. when the law of the United States says if someone is here unlawfully. they cannot work. So that is what this is all about. I just want to push back. I urge my colleaguesat least seven of my Democratic colleagues have said they oppose President Obamas actions. When do they have a clearer chance to confront that action and demonstrate with conviction that they meant what they said than on this vote? It allows the bill to come forward. It allows us to have a vote. It allows anybody in the Senate to offer amendments that would be relevant to the bill. I feel strongly about that. I see the Senator from New York. I think she was in line to speak before I was. and I was able to grab a few minutes. So I would just say this. Colleagues. please review your position on this. Lets move to this bill. Lets fund Homeland Security. Lets discuss and have amendments and vote on the Presidents Executive order. and the one who wins the votes. so be it. That is the way the Congress of the United States works. I thank the Chair. and I yield the floor."
1140009978,"Mr. President. one of the measures that took place in this Executive amnesty that has been too little commented upon since the President signed these orders in November is another program which has not been authorized by law which would add several hundred thousand new workers to our country. This is the headline from an article today: ""DHS Extends Eligibility for Employment Authorization to Certain H4 Dependent Spouses of HlB Nonimmigrants Seeking EmploymentBased Lawful Permanent Residence."" The HlB program was set up for certain individuals to come and work for 3 years and then extend maybe another 3 years only. to take a job in those industries and fields where there is a shortage of workers. and it does allow the spouses to come. But since its beginning it has barred spouses from working. otherwise we would be doubling the number of workers. So this bill now just up and approves spouses of HlB workers to work. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service. USCIS. estimates that ""the number of individuals eligible to apply for employment authorization under this rule could be as high as 179.600 in the first year and 55.000 annually in subsequent years."" This is a very large addition to the workforce. One might say: Well. it is good that spouses can work. Well. what if your child wants a job? What if you want a job? What if your spouse wants a job and is looking for a job? Now we will have another 250.000 job applicants. contrary to law. There are many other aspects of the Presidents Executive order that have not been given attention. I think this one is worth commenting about. There has been no sense at all by President Obama. the Department of Homeland Security. Jeh Johnson. the Democratic Members of this Congressno concern about the employment prospects of lawful immigrants. green card holders. and nativeborn Americans. We have high unemployment and the lowest percentage of Americans in the working age group actually holding jobs in America that we have had since 1970. Wages are down. Professor Borjas at Harvard documents that excessive immigration pulls down wages. Since 2007 wages of medianincome families are down $4.000. I would say to colleagues that the first thing we should do is focus on getting jobs for Americans who are unemployed. Are we going to keep Americans on welfare and benefits while we bring in more and more foreigners to take jobs when we have Americans ready and willing to take those jobs? They like to suggest these guest workers are doing farm work. They are not. The overwhelming majority of guest workers admitted to the U.S. are not farm workers. but are taking jobs throughout the economy. A farm worker program. with temporary labor. if properly managed. is a good program. I do not oppose that. People come and work for a period of time. and if they return home and come back the next season and make enough money to take care of their families maybe for the whole year. that can work if properly managed. But look at this. The HlBs are people with hightech degrees. hightech skills. They are competing against college graduates who have computer skills and other skills. This is what we get. This is how it is working in this country. A bunch of companies got together and they signed a letter to Speaker BOEHNER and NANCY PELOSI. the Democratic leader in the House. asking for immigration reform back in September 2013. They said they needed more HlB workers. and they pushed for that. I would just note this: Byron York from the Washington Examiner has written about this. and this is what the facts are. They are not hiring people. They dont have a shortage of workers. They are laying off workers in very large numbers. HewlettPackard had 29.000 job cuts in 201229.000. They signed the letter. Cisco Systems eliminated 4.000 jobs in August 2013 in addition to 8.000 cut in the last 2 years. They signed the letter asking for more HlB workers. United Technologies cut 3.000 jobs in 2013. American Express. 5.400 jobs in 2013. Procter & Gamble. 5.700 jobs in 2012. and TMobile. 2.250 layoffs in 2012. These are companies that are asking for more foreign workers. This is another report that was in the Los Angeles Times just a few days ago: ""A loophole in immigration law is costing thousands of American jobs."" Since last summer. [Southern California] Edison The biggest utility company in Californiawhich serves nearly 14 million customers. has been firing its domestic IT workers and replacing them with outsourced employees from India .... The pay for Edisons domestic IT specialists is about $80.000 to $160.000 not including benefits. Good pay. The two Indian outsourcing firms providing workers to Edison. Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys. pay their recruits an average of about $65.000 to $71.000. according to federal filings. They are laying off hundreds and requiring the California Edison employees to train the HlB workers who shouldnt be coming into America unless there is a job need that is unfilled. How can you say we dont have qualified people? They are doing the job. and they are expected to train them. This is the kind of thing that is out of control. Somebody needs to defend the legitimate interests of middle America. We need to ask ourselves: Does this make sense? Should the President be doubling up on it with his Executive amnesty that would add 179.600 new workers in the first year of his order and 55.000 more annually on top of the HlB flow? We have legislation that has moved in this Senate that would more than double the number of HlB workers coming into the country when the evidence indicates they are not needed. It might make businesses happy. they can pay half the salary of what they would otherwise be paying. But it would not be good for Americans who invested in education. trained themselves. worked themselves into a good job. and have it pulled out from under them. I thank the Chair and yield the floor."
1140027489,"Mr. President. I was under the impression that we would be able to have discussion and debate on the legislation before us. My two amendments would deal with two very serious issues. I am disappointed that we have an objection. My first amendment. 1233. would ensure that any changes to U.S. law or policy are passed by Congress. Specifically. if implementing legislation allowed future changes to be made to a trade agreement that could affect or overrule existing U.S. law without Congressional approval. then that legislation could not be fasttracked. The implementing legislation would have to guarantee that all future changes would have to be approved by Congress. I think that is perfectly appropriate. and it is an absolute responsibility of Congress to ensure its own authority in matters of these kind. Indeed. the Constitution gives plenary authority to Congress over immigration law and trade. Under this amendment that I have offered. Congress cannot delegate the power to change U.S. law to the ExecutiveCongress cannot do that and must not do thator to some international body that would be created if this trade agreementthe TransPacific Partnershipenters into force. This is not made clear under the current bill. Colleagues. we need to think about this commissionan international commissionthat will be created with 11 trading partners in the TPP. This commission will be given power. and our trading partners will be given powers if Congress approves this. presumably. Under the TPP. that commission is given the authority to amend the trade agreement that is initially passed if they find that circumstances have changed and they desire to change it. This is called the living agreement provision. The living agreement provision explicitly states these things in this trade agreement. The term living agreement should make our hair stand up on the backs of our necks because this is a dangerous thing. What it means is that the commission can alter the agreement. We want to be sure that if this commission alters the agreementassuming the TPP enters into forcethat it is not given the power to change U.S. law. even if the President agrees. There is another question. Senator BROWN. I think. has offered an amendment on this question. and my amendment would also fix it. It deals with the admission of new countries into the 11 party12. counting the United StatesTPP trade agreement. It is pretty clear. This commission has the power to admit new members. It says: With regard to the amendment process of the commission. that the process will look similar to that of the World Trade Organization. We have shared this with Senator HATCH and his fine staff. I think they understand what we are talking about here. This suggests that TPP procedures are likely to mirror WTO procedures. Well. the United States has had a longterm problem with the World Trade Organization because we approved the World Trade Organization and passed legislation implementing that agreement. and we did not realize it allowed new members to be admitted without a vote of Congress. So under TPP. if it mirrors the WTO rules for amendments and accessions. the new membersit appears quite plain to mecould be admitted by just 8 of the 12 TPP membersnot a unanimous vote as NATO requires or the European Union requires. At one point. the TPP says there must be ""consensus."" but then it talks about WTO. WTO does not require consensus on everything. So I have to say. colleagues. that. first and foremost. I do not know why we have to create a new commissiona transnational commission that has the ability to discipline the United States. to impose penalties on the United States by what might be a twothirds vote under a number of circumstances. and create additional constraints on the ability of this great Nation to function. I do not know why we would not be better off dealingas we have done with other countrieswith bilateral trade agreements between the two of us. not creating some international body such as the United Nations. the WTO. or as Europe has done with the European Union. So I am disappointed that we are not going to be able to have my amendment to address this called up now. because if they can block this amendment from being called up. this amendment can be shut out altogether. That is the fact. The train would be advancing without real debate and without a real opportunity for this concept to be addressed and voted on by Members of Congress. I am sure people would rather not have it come upwould rather not have questions about this agreement be raised. I think it is a legitimate question. I would urge my colleagues to continue to evaluate the amendment and to see if we cannot get it up pending. Lets have a vote on it. and lets adopt it. Now. I also have offered amendment No. 1234. First. my previous amendment was No. 1233. This would be 1234. It would hold the Obama administration and the United States Trade Representative to their assurances that no trade agreement will be used to change U.S. immigration law or policy. This has been done in the past to a significant degree. It resulted in Chairman SENSEN3RENNER and ranking member CONYERS writing a letter saying: Never again should any trade agreement amend immigration law. That is the province of the Congress. according to the Constitution. In 2003. I offered a resolution after a past trade agreement did just thatbypassed Congress authority over immigration law. The resolution passed unanimously. Senator FEINSTEIN and other Democrats signed on. It said: Never again will immigration law be amended as part of a trade agreement. Trade agreements are not the way to change law of the United States. especially when you have a President who is rewriting immigration law. enforcing immigration law that Congress explicitly rejected through his Executive amnesty. So my amendment is modeled after the Congressional Responsibility for Immigration Act of 2003. a bill sponsored by our Democratic colleagues. Senators LEAHY. FEINSTEIN. and Kennedyformer Senator Kennedy. our former colleague. It would prohibit the application of fasttrack authority procedures to any implementing bill that affects U.S. immigration law or policy or the entry of aliens. if an implementing bill or trade agreement violates those terms. Then. any Member could raise a point of order against the implementing bill. ensuring that the bill is considered under regular Senate procedures allowing amendment and debate. Look. now they tell us that we should not be concerned. Colleagues. we have heard it said that this will not happenno future trade agreements will affect U.S. immigration law. All right. but I am a little nervous about that. I have been watching the language on this. Senator GRASSLEY. at the Finance Committee hearing a few weeks ago. asked the Trade Representative. Mr. Froman. this: My question: Could you assure the committee that the TPP agreement or any side agreement does not and will not contain any provision relating to immigration. visa processing or temporary entries of persons? That is a good questionsimple question. They have been indicating not. His answer sounds good at first blush. Thank you. Senator Grassley. And the answer is yes. I can assure you that we are not negotiating anything in TPP that would require any modifications of the U.S. immigration laws or system. any changes of our existing visa system. and in fact the TPP explicitly states that it will not require any changes in any partys immigration law or procedures. Now the 11 other TPP countries are making offers to each other in the area of temporary entry. but we have decided not to do so. So I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that. So we have decided not to do sonow. at this moment. before the trade agreement is up for approval by Congress. knowing it would be controversial if the implementing bill included immigration changes. But that does not mean we are not party to any immigration provisions in the TPP that could be used to make changes later. One of the chapters in the agreement deals with immigration and temporary entry. I do not see anything that would prohibit the current administration or a new administration from trying to use this trade agreement to advance an immigration agenda. So if the Trade Representative really means it when he assures us there will be no changes in the future. then I would suggest my amendment would be something that Ambassador Froman would be delighted to support to keep us from having this problem and to remove this potential controversy from the legislation. I think it would alsofor those who want to see it passedenhance the opportunity to pass the legislation. I yield the floor."
1140069120,"Mr. President. today I wish to recognize the life and accomplishments of civil rights attorney Fred Gray. Sr.. of Montgomery. AL. Fred Gray was born in Montgomery. AL. on December 14. 1930. He attended the Nashville Christian Institute and received a baccalaureate degree from the thenAlabama State College for Negroes. From there. he went on to receive a law degree from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland. OH. Mr. Gray passed the bar examination and returned to his home town of Montgomery to establish a law office. He dedicated himself to the goal of ""destroying everything segregated he could find."" He also began preaching at the Holt Street Church of Christ. During the 1950s and 1960s civil rights movement. Mr. Gray worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. E.D. Nixon. and other leaders of the movement. He represented Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks. who were charged with disorderly conduct for refusing to seat themselves in the rear of segregated city buses. Mr. Gray also successfully defended Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. against tax evasion charges. In addition. he represented the Montgomery Improvement Association during the more than yearlong Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955. which ultimately led to the United States Supreme Court case Browder v. Gayle. This case was filed by Mr. Gray. Additionally. Mr. Gray filed and argued the historic and muchcited case of Gomillion v. Lightfoot before the U.S. Supreme Court. which overturned State redistricting of Tuskegee. AL. After this case. Mr. Gray continued to lead legal efforts to desegregate schools in Alabama. In 1970. Mr. Gray was one of the first African Americans elected as a State legislator in Alabama. However. he did not allow his new role to prevent him from continuing to represent local Alabamians in the judicial system. In the early 1970s. Mr. Gray represented plaintiffs in the classaction lawsuit regarding the Federal Tuskegee syphilis study and succeeded in securing appropriate damages and restitutions for 72 study survivors. As a result of efforts led by Mr. Gray. President Clinton invited the study survivors and their families to a ceremony at the White House. where he officially apologized for the actions of the Federal Government regarding the study. In 2002. Fred Gray became the first AfricanAmerican president of the Alabama Bar Association. Mr. Gray has spent his life working to achieve equal justice and liberty for the citizens of Alabama. His dedication to the civil rights movement is unequaled. and we are all grateful for the tireless work he has done on behalf of all Americans.*"
1140080833,"Madam President. I would like to talk for a few minutes about the crime problem we have in America today. the dramatically increasing problem of heroin abuse. Over the last week. we have had a lot of discussion about this crisis. which I am afraid we are just on the cusp of. I think it is going to get worse. based on my experience and my best judgment. but the effort to understand and address it has been going on for a while. In January. we had a good hearing on this issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee. and I want to mention a few things I think we ought to keep in mind as we address this very important problem. Just as background. I served 15 years as a prosecutor. 12 as a U.S. attorney. a Federal prosecutor. and 212 as an assistant U.S. attorney. So that was my background when I came here. I was very active and studied the drug and crime problem in America. and I learned some things. There are cycles in this. and people wrote about it over the years. I think we are. unfortunately. moving into another cycle. and we have to be very careful. It is so painful to have a large prison population. We dont want to have that. Year after year. everybody wants to look for alternatives to prison. and we have tried. but if you go too far. you end up not having sufficient consequences for crime. not detaining dangerous offenders. and you end up increasing crime. increasing deaths of Americans from murders and other things. increasing heroin and serious drug problems that destroy families. destroy lives. destroy communities. and result in violence and death. It is a very real problem. A lot of people think. well. if you want to use heroin. so be it. Well. these people cant function. How are they going to survive? They either steal or they get on welfare or they have to go to treatment. And who pays for it. since they do not have any money? We have proven and seen for decades that drug use can be brought down. fewer people can become addicted. In the early 1980s. Nancy Reagan. as President Reagans wonderful wife. formed the ""Just Say No"" program. and hundreds of thousands of volunteers nationwide in every community in America got together in their communitiesthey got the treatment community. the law enforcement community. the prevention community. the education community. and the schoolsand they worked and worked and crafted policies that would create a climate of hostility for the use of dangerous drugs. The idea was to bring down the use. As a result. the use of illegal drugs dropped by half. It took us 15 or more years. but it dropped by half steadily. What a tremendous victory. In 1980. half of our high school seniors admitted they had used an illegal drug sometime in that year. What an unbelievable number. It had been going up steadily. it peaked. and then it began to go down under this sustained effort. What I have been worried about for some time. and have warned about it. is that if you dont maintain that but start going in the other direction. you can expect drug use to increase. It is that simple. And it is happening. Livesand young peoples liveswill be destroyed by this. families will break up. and children will be scarred. Drug use is no fun. innocent thing. It is destructive. If this Nation is using half as much illegal drugs as before. it is a better nation. It just is. And if we double the amount of drug use in America. it will be a more dangerous Nation and not as good a nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. over 47.000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014. In 2014. 47.000 died. That is one drug overdose death for every 12 minutes. And 61 percent of those overdoses involved opioids. The rate of all opioid overdoses in the United States has tripled since 2000. Overdoses have tripled since 2000. Heroin overdose deaths specifically have increased sixfold since 2001600 percentand have more than tripled in just the past 4 years alone. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. there were approximately 169.000 new heroin users in 2013. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. in 2004. approximately 589.000 people in the United States had an opioid use disorder. We used to call that addictiona problem. It is affecting their lives. The Drug Enforcement Administrations 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment noted that ""drug overdose deaths have become the leading cause of injury death in the United States. ahead of motor vehicle deaths and firearms."" This is a significant matter. As DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg. a bright. young mind appointed by President Obama. noted last July that ""[a]pproximately 120 people die each day in the United States of a drug overdose."" Some argue that the increase in heroin abuse is due to overprescription of opioids from prescription drugsyou get addicted from a prescription drug. and then you move to heroin. I am sure that has some validity. but according to a January 14. 2016. study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. one of the premier authoritative medical journals in the world: In the majority of studies. the increase in the rates of heroin use preceded the change in prescriptionopioid policies. and there is no consistent evidence of an association between the implementation of policies related to prescription opioids and increases in the rates of heroin use or deaths. although the data are relatively sparse. Alternatively. heroin market forces Please hear this. colleaguesAlternatively. heroin market forces. including increased accessibility. reduced price. and high purity of heroin appear to be major drivers of the recent increases in rates of heroin use. So it is purity. price. and accessibility. While treatment and accountability are critical to breaking the cycle of addiction. it is not the whole solution. We must also reduce the availability of heroinwe simply have to do thatand other illicit opioids. In December of last year. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said it is important ""that law enforcement""-a lot of people dont want to talk about this. We have police officers. sheriffs deputies. Federal agents. drug enforcement agents. and Border Patrol agents. He said it is important ""that law enforcement intensify efforts to reduce the availability of heroin. illegal fentanyl. and other illegal opioids."" Similarly. Drug Enforcement Administration Acting Administrator Rosenberg said in the DEAs National Drug Threat Assessment that. in addition to providing treatment to addicted opioid abusers. ""law enforcement must continue to have the tools it needs to attack criminal groups who facilitate drug addiction."" I have been there. I was part of law enforcements efforts. I invested a tremendous amount of my time in the Coalition for a Drug Free Mobile. the Partnership for Youth. Bay Area Drug Councilgroups like thatworking on a volunteer basis to change the use of drugs in the community. Law enforcement was always a critical part of it. and law enforcement does have the capability in ways that others dont to reduce the availability. make purity levels less. and otherwise restrict. raising the price of an illegal drug. The DEAs 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment confirms this. They studied the price of the drugs. One thing that tells us whether or not law enforcement and interdiction are effective is to discover if the price is going up or down. Mexican drug cartels are flooding the United States with cheap heroin and methamphetamine. When I was a young prosecutor. it was coming from Turkey. the Middle East. and that was pretty much shut off. President Carter did some good things. I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and came back a few years later as a U.S. Attorney. but during that time they somehow reduced the supply of heroin from the Middle East. As a result. heroin addiction dropped all over the country. and very little heroin was in the heartland of Americamainly just in the big cities. We are also getting cheap methamphetamine from across the Mexican border. which is wide open. The statistics from the DEA Drug Threat Assessment confirm that. from 2010 to 2014. the amount of heroin seized every year at the southwest border has more than doubled. Well. are we catching that much more? No. we are not catching. I am sure. any substantially larger percentage. We are just having a larger amount moving across the border. The price has fallen. so we know we have more. If prices stay low. more people will try it more often. and as the purity level is higher. more people will get addicted sooner and often die quicker. These drug cartels are partnering with criminal gangs and fueling violence in our cities and communities. According to DEAs 2015 Threat Assessment. Mexican drug cartels ""control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their presence in the United States. particularly in heroin markets."" They import. transport. and are now actually selling it in our cities instead of just bringing it in across the border. In 2013. the heads of the Chicago Crime Commission and the Chicago Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration both named El Chapo Guzman. the infamous leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. as Chicagos ""Public Enemy #1."" So a man in Mexico. moving heroin and methamphetamine into the United States and hammering Chicago with itChicago named him as their No. 1 public enemy. It cannot be a coincidence. as the FBIs uniform crime statistics show. that the murder rate in Chicago increased by approximately 18 percent during the first 6 months of 2015. At that rate. it is a 36 percent increase in murders in Chicago in 1 year. This is an unbelievably dramatic surge in murders. Another example is Atlanta. DEAs Atlanta office reported an increase of heroin availability from a rating of ""stable"" in the first half of 2013 to ""high"" just a year later. According to the FBIs uniform crime statistics. the murder rate in Atlanta increased by approximately 15 percent in the first 6 months of 2015. This is an unsustainable thing. The old rule is a 7percent increase and your money doubles in 10 years. When you get 15and 18percent increases in 6 monthsthats 30 percent in 1 yearyou are doubling the crime rate. the murder rate. in 3 years. At a November hearing of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control. I asked DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley about these drug distribution networks and the people in local communities pushing the drugs. selling the drugs. and collecting the money. This money eventually ends up back in Mexico. Colombia. and South and Central America. funding the evil. violent drug cartels that are destabilizing whole nations. He responded that it is ""almost as big a problem as the cartels themselves."" When I asked him whether these drug traffickers are the ones causing the violence and death on our streets. he responded that ""they are the ones that regulate themselves by the barrel of a gun."" If you want to collect a drug debt. you cant file a lawsuit in Federal court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun. By its very nature. drug distribution networks are violent criminals. It has always been so. and it will always be so. Conducting an illegal enterprise. they have to maintain discipline. and they use threats and violence to maintain it and collect their debts. We must not forget what became obvious in the early 1980s. when I was a U.S. Attorney: Drug dealers and their organizations are not nonviolent criminals. These are violent crimes. Rather than enforcing the law and making it tougher on drug cartels by keeping our border secure. the Obama administration has done exactly the opposite. Our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to flood our country with cheap heroin. and the administration has made it clear that officers are not to deviate from the Presidents lawless immigration policy. They are blocked from doing their job and following their oath. Just last weekand as someone who has worked closely with Federal Drug Enforcement officers and immigration officers as a Federal prosecutorCustoms and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske testified before the House Committee on Appropriations that ""if you dont want to follow the directions of your superiors. including the president of the United States and the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. then you really do need to look for another job."" Do you hear what he is saying there. colleagues? What he is saying is that if you want to do your job and enforce the laws as the laws are written. which we have ordered you not to do. and you go on and do it anyway. then look for another job. It is one of the most amazing things I have seen in my entire law enforcement career. ICE officersImmigration and Customs Enforcement officerswho enforce drug laws. along with immigration laws. these officers sued their supervisors. They sued their supervisors. alleging that they were being ordered to violate their oath to enforce the immigration laws of the United States by these restrictive policies. It is hard to overestimate the destruction the Obama administrations policiestheir Executive amnesty. their refusal to sufficiently fund and man the borderare causing to law enforcement. A big part of this now is the openness to heroin. methamphetamine. marijuana. and other drugs that are being imported. I take that statement by the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection as a direct threat to those officers who want to follow their oath and do their duty. In August 2013. a dramatic event occurred that was too little appreciated. Attorney General Holder. the Attorney General of the United States. ordered Federal prosecutors not to charge certain drug offenders with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences that are in law. If you have so much drugs. you have a minimum penalty. You can get more than that. but you at least have to serve this minimum penalty. He ordered them not to charge those crimes. This is directing prosecutors not to follow the law. It has contributed to a decrease in the number of traffickers being prosecuted and convicted. According to data from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. at the end of 2015in Decemberthe 6month average of drug prosecutions was down 21 percent compared to 5 years ago. And what are we seeing? A surge in crime. particularly drugs. Excluding prosecutions in magistrate courts. the 6month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. We havent cut the number of drug prosecutors. We havent cut the number of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we have been doing for 25 years. and it is having an impact. I am afraid it is going to continue. Meanwhile. State and local law enforcement agencies are not given the tools they need to continue taking these dangerous drug traffickers off of the streets. On December 21. 2015. the Department of Justice chose to stop all equitable sharing payments to State. local. and tribal partners under the Asset Forfeiture Program. These are seized proceeds. moneys that are seized from drug dealers. big fancy cars and boats that they seize. For the last 20 years. Federal and State officers worked together. The Federal Government has a good system for forfeiting the money. Then. when the forfeiture is over. it is divided among the agencies. As a result. State and local people are willing to commit law officers to participate in these local task forces because they are helping clean up drugs in their community. helping identify and prosecute nationally significant drug dealers. and they get some compensation back from it when they find a truck full of money. I personally have seen cases where $1 million. $500.000. $800.000 in cash was seized from these people. Some people think. oh. this is wrong. you shouldnt take their cash. This is the illgotten gain of an illegal enterprise and they should be able to keep it? They have no proof of any lawful source of this money. Virtually every time. in addition. there is evidence to prove it is connected to drugs. Half the time. they dont even show up to contest the seizure because they know they have no defense to it. This stops this sharing. and it is undermining the unity of effort that we really need to be successful. A joint letter signed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. the National Association of Police Organizations. the Major County Sheriffs Association. the National Sheriffs Association. the National District Attorneys Association. and the Major Cities Chiefs Association. pointed out that ""the suspension of equitable sharing payments may cause some agencies across the country to reconsider their ability to participate in joint task forces with the Federal Government."" In other words. they are going to stop participating. ""The effects of this decision are far reaching and not only a disservice to law enforcement. but also to the public they are sworn to protect."" Mr. President. if there is a limit on my time or others are waiting to speak. I will wrap up. Otherwise. I have about 5 minutes to wrap up. I see my colleague Senator LEAHY. the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I dont want to block him. If my time is up. I will yield the floor."
1140081141,Mr. President. today I wish to recognize Dr. Mark Foley. who has served with great distinction and honor at the University of Mobile for more than 17 years. Dr. Foley has served as president of the University of Mobile since 1998 and is the third president of the university since its founding in 1961. He will be retiring from his post on July 31. 2016. Dr. Foley came to the University of Mobile during a critical transitional time and led the school through a period of significant growth. Under his guidance. the university has flourished. Facilities have been updated. the school is on more solid financial footing. and programs and the stature of the university have improved. During his time at the University of Mobile. Dr. Foley led the university to invest $44.8 million in capital projects. including a recent $7 million campus enhancement program that thoroughly revitalized the campus. Under Dr. Foleys leadership. the university gained national recognition from U.S. News & World Report. Americas Best Christian Colleges. Americas Best College Buys. and many more. Dr. Foley helped to integrate a Christian worldview into all aspects of academics. campus life. and university operations at this quality Baptistaffiliated institution. The university now has more than 1.500 students enrolled in over 40 undergraduate and graduate programs. A former truckstop operator. Dr. Foley was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1990 after receiving his master of divinity degree from the New Orleans seminary. He received his doctorate from that same institution in 1992 and completed postdoctoral studies in education. Though the university was struggling with a variety of financial problems when Dr. Foley took over in 1998. he turned the school around. The University of Mobile has continued to thrive under Dr. Foleys tenure. As a native of Mobile. AL. it has been my honor to work with Dr. Foley and witness the great accomplishments he has achieved at the University of Mobile. His hard work and genuine passion for higher education is apparent and the students of the University of Mobile will miss his leadership. I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for all he has done for the university. for Mobile. and for Alabama. I thank the Chair.*

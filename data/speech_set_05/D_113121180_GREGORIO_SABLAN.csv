1130045074,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 256. The bill conveys to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands 3 miles of surrounding submerged lands. providing parity with Americas other coastal States and territories. S. 256 also provides for a hiatus in 2013 and 2015 of the annual 50cent increase in minimum wage in the Northern Marianas. while retaining the mandate to reach the Federal level. I want to thank the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. RON WYDEN. and Ranking Member LISA MURKOWSKI for introducing S. 256 at my request. Its companion. H.R. 573. passed the House unanimously in May of this year. as did predecessor bills in the 111th and the 112th Congresses. Thanks also to leaders and staff from both sides of the aisle: Chairman Doec HASTINGS of the House Natural Resources Committee and Ranking Member PETER DEFAZIO. Chairman JOHN FLEMING on the Fisheries. Wildlife. Oceans. and Insular Affairs Subcommittee. and the chairman on the Education and the Workforce Committee. JOHN KLINE. and Ranking Member GEORGE MILLER. Their assistance reflects a longstanding tradition of treating territorial issues as essentially nonpartisan. To summarize briefly. the Northern Mariana Islands is the only U.S. coastal jurisdiction that does not have ownership of the submerged lands off its coast. S. 256 corrects that irregularity and provides the same ownership rights over the submerged lands surrounding the Northern Marianas as are provided by Federal law to Guam. the U.S. Virgin Islands. and American Samoa. Additionally. S. 256 reschedules the rate of increase of the minimum wage in the Northern Mariana Islands. but it retains the mandate to reach the Federal minimum wage level. which will occur in 2018. The wage has risen 82 percent since 200716.5 percent each year. The Government Accountability Office has reported uncertainty over how this rapid change affects the local economy. especially given the negative GDP in most of those years. Congress previously provided for the scheduled 2011 increase to be skipped. In light of continuing unpredictability of the impact of annual increases on an economy where as much as 80 percent of the hourly paid workforce will be affected. similar deferrals of the 2013 and 2015 increases are advisable. I ask for Members to support S. 256 today as the House has supported these same proposals in the past. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130072230,Mr. Speaker. most Americans would agree on the essential importance of education to a successful and meaningful life. But knowledge in and of itself is insufficient without a moral and ethical context for its appropriate application. Thus. the importance of Catholic schools. which we celebrate this week. In the Northern Mariana Islands the Catholic schools of Eskuelan San Francisco de Borja on Rota. St. Joseph Catholic School on Tinian. and Mount Carmel School on the Saipan. have been the vanguard not only in educational excellence. but also in the inculcation of spiritual values. Graduates of these schools. who now fill every nook and cranny of leadership in our communities. carry both intellectual skills and a moral compass to their work in our society. We are all better off as a result. And. at least in part. we have Catholic schools to thank. We have also to thank the parents of every Catholic school student. For. over the years. these parents have chosen to sacrifice. to deploy their limited resources. to send their sons and daughters to parochial schools. Even as the quality of free. public education in the Northern Marianas has continued to improveand I am sure that faculty and students in our fine public institutions would even proudly argue to surpass our Catholic schoolsstill have parents found something of extra value in those Catholic schools and continued to pay for their children to receive a Catholic education. And we have to thank the religious and lay teachers in our Catholic schools. These women and men have chosen to forego material rewards of life in order to serve as the conduit for the moral system that underlies the academic content of their classrooms. Often among the best educated members of our community. rather than using their knowledge to advance their own interests these teachers disseminate what they know. so that many lives may be enriched. Their service and sacrifice. too. we celebrate and recognize during Catholic Schools Week. Lastly. we congratulate the students in our Catholic schools. You are part of a heritage in the Northern Mariana Islands that we trace back directly to the founding of Mount Carmel School in 1952. but which certainly has its roots with the original Catholic missionaries of the 16th century. That is a remarkable tradition. One to be proud of. as you mark Catholic Schools Week. and to carry on.

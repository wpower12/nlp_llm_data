1130035097,I want to thank the gentleman for organizing the opportunity to say thank you. First. thank you to God for sending us Bill Gray. Thank you to God for having an individual who understands who he was. where he came from. and how he got here. and never forgetting about those least than he. Bill Gray knew what his purpose was in life. Many individuals go through this thing that we call life and never find out what our purpose is. But all you have to do is to look at the works of Bill Gray. and you know his purpose was to serve people. to serve people who needed a hand up. to serve people who sometimes are forgotten about. to serve people to make sure that their tomorrow was better than their yesterday. When I think of Bill Gray. one of the first things that I was told when I got elected to Congress. by an individual who looked up to him. my predecessor. the Reverend Floyd H. Flake. said that Reverend Gray inspired him because. like Reverend Gray. Reverend Flake had a large congregation. And he understood how he could take that skill. being a minister. and help the masses. In fact. I can recall a statement made by Representative Gray when he was appointed. when he was elected the chair of the Budget Committee. They asked him. What do you know about budgets? He said. Have you ever been the pastor of a Baptist church? And he showed that he did understand budgets and money. and how to deal with it. and he did it in such a masterful way. He also understood the world. and the global world. Even the last few conversations I had with him were about the world. were about going out to countries. whether they be on the continent of Africa or right here in North America. whether it was in the Western Hemisphere. and how he could help people. all people. but especially people of African descent. so that they too can rise and see and accomplish all that they could be. So death is alwaysand I send my condolences to the familyits a sad thing. But when one has had such a stellar life. when one has made the kind of contributions. its a celebration. Its a celebration that we need to thank God for. and we need to thank the fact that God sent him here so that he could be that bright and shining star for all to see and many to follow. He leaves a legacy for us to follow. We will follow. We will miss him. but we thank him for his service to mankind.
1130046273,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume. This bipartisan legislation creates a Special Envoy to Promote Religious Freedom of Religious Minorities in the Near East and South Central Asia. Housed at the State Department. the Special Envoy would be responsible for monitoring and combating acts of religious intolerance. engaging with foreign governments to address laws that discriminate against religious minorities. and working to ensure that the unique needs of religious minority communities are being addressed. This bill is important because religious minority communities all around the worldparticularly in the Near East and South Central Asiaare facing increased attacks and persecution. For example. Egypts recent governments have failed to prevent. investigate. or prosecute crimes against members of religious minority groups. especially Coptic Christians. Churches have been burned to the ground and numerous Christians murdered. Iraq used to have a significant number of religious minorities. These groups have been subject to escalating violence. persecution. and discrimination for their religious beliefs. and today they comprise only about 3 percent of Iraqs population. By some estimates. half of Iraqs Christian population has fled since 2003. In Iran. the arrest and harassment of members of religious minorities. including Sunni Muslims and Christians. continues to rise. In one notable case last year. an IranianAmerican Christian pastor was imprisoned for threatening Iranian national security. And what was his crime? Helping to set up small churches in peoples homes. Irans minority Bahai community is particularly harassed. punished. imprisoned. and even killed simply because of their religion. This past August. a Bahai community leader in Bandar Abbas. IranMr. Ataollah Rezvaniwas found murdered in his car on the outskirts of the city. shot in the back of the head. He had been the subject of threats and pressure from agents of the Ministry of Intelligence. and until shortly before his death he had been receiving menacing phone calls from unidentified persons. There is little doubt that his murder was religiously motivated. Until now. the Iranian Government has not begun a formal investigation into his murder or the murder of many other Bahais that have been killed in recent years. It is past time for the Iranian Government to move immediately to seek justice for the cruel deaths of its Bahai citizens. I wish these were isolated cases. but countless other examples exist. from Afghanistan to India to Saudi Arabia. We indeed are fortunate to live in a country that was founded by religious refugees on principles of tolerance. But it is important that we do everything we can to ensure that religious minorities elsewhere in the world enjoy the freedoms and protections they deservethe freedoms and protections enjoyed by all Americans. Appointing this Special Envoy would be an important step in that direction. and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130046296,Mr. Speaker. at this time. I yield myself such time as I may consume to explain that this legislation would require the Secretary of State to develop a multiyear strategy to bolster the Organization of American States. OAS as we know it. and improve the performance and the process for managing the budget and the personnel at the OAS. When it was founded in 1948. it was the sole multilateral body in the Western Hemisphere. As the premier hemispheric organization. the OAS key institutional documentsits charter. the American Declaration of Rights. the InterAmerican Democratic Charterenshrine values that are the foundation for political systems in the Americas. Since its founding. the OAS has accepted too many mandates from its member states. resulting in a loss of international focus. and in turn has reduced. frankly. the organizations effectiveness. This bill seeks to push the OAS to refocus on those two core principles of promoting democratic governance and institutions and resolving regional disputes. This push comes as other regional bodies are competing with the OAS for regional influence. There is the Central American System of Integration. the Union of South American Nations. and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. which includes Cuba but excludes both the United States and Canada. Many of these political bodies do not represent our values. Most exclude the U.S. Many are used by governments in the region to undermine the U.S.. thus undermining U.S. diplomacy in the hemisphere. In order to maintain the OAS as an influential. positive force and to defend U.S. engagement. it is important that the U.S. spearhead an effort to reform the OAS and address its many administrative challenges. This bill calls on the administration to develop a strategy that helps the OAS focus on its core mission. shed nonessential programs. install a resultsbased budgeting process. and adopt transparent. competitive personnel practices. Additionally. this bill was strengthened in committee to recognize that it is not politically or financially viable for any OAS member state. including the United States. to pay more than 50 percent of the institutions assessed fees. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker.
1130050821,Mr. Speaker. the politricks have to stop. The politricks have to stop. Today. I looked at one of my leading New York papers and this is the headline. This is what they are thinking of this House. The politricks have to stop. The divide and conquer mentality has to stop. Why is it politricks? Look at whats really taking place here today and has been taking place over the last few days. We should be just. as other Congresses have done. passing a clean CR bill so that we can continue the government moving. But what do we do? We bring up issues that have nothing to do with the continuing resolution. The first trick: repeal the Affordable Care Act. The second trick: delay the Affordable Care Act. The trick after that: delay the individual mandate. Then next you hear something: end the medical device tax. Then the next thing is: go to conferencesomething that Democrats have been asking for on budgetary issues since April. And now this piecemeal approach. Its politricks. folks. Its divide and conquer. Its trying to take key issues from key individuals and make them decide whether you want to go this way or that way. Its making individuals try to decide in the Federal Government who is more important than the others. Youve got individuals working in the same divisions. some wont get paid. others will get paid. Its a divide and conquer mentality that could destroy the Nation. This Nation is supposed to be one together. United we stand. Dont divide this country. Dont pick winners and losers. Send all of Americans back to work. Eight hundred thousand did not work today. Dont just pick a few and say you should go back to work. All of them should go back to work. They are all American citizens. Let all of Americans free. Dont hold them in bondage. dont keep them back. Free them all. Dont go piece by piece. They all want the same thing. Their bills have to be paid. I have to tell some of mine on my staff. for example: If you happen to get sick. you cant get paid. Thats not what this country is supposed to be about. The world is looking at us. We travel the world trying to show examples of democracy every place else. yet were undercutting the greatest democracy in the world today over the last couple of days. Weve got procedures that were put in place by the Founding Fathers. We are undercutting how they said we should do it. Lets not divide. Lets bring this Nation back together. Lets send all of our workers back to work. Lets have a clean CR bill. and lets vote on that.
1130085701,I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois. from the great city of Chicago. who long before he came to Congress. as a member of the Chicago City Council. spoke truth to power. And the words he has just articulated. that we should never forget that we will make sure that we are our brothers keeper. that we need not have what I would call a gang mentality ourselves. that simply because someone is away across the ocean. may not look like some of us look. may not talk or speak the way we speak. that when we see evil. we wont stand silently by. We will stand against it and fight. Dr. King once said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. and so it is that evil anywhere is a threat to all of us everywhere. Yesterday. Rwanda launched a week of official mourning to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the genocide which left 800.000 people dead and changed the face of a nation forever. and I want the people of Rwanda to know that I stand in solidarity with them during this week of mourning. But I will also stand with them next week. and I will stand with them the week after that. and I will stand with them the week after. because what happened during the spring and summer of 1994 is too important to be mourned only on an anniversary. The tragic consequences of ethnic hatred and violence must never be forgotten. for we must never allow the events of 1994 to be repeatednot in Rwanda or anywhere else. We must. once and for all. put all racial and ethnic strife behind us as we strive for a better and a brighter future for our children and grandchildren. Mr. Speaker. we have. in this Chamber today. one whose voice has always spoken about justice. one whose actions were to feed those who were hungry. clothe those who had no clothes. and put a roof over the head of those who were homeless. We have in the Chamber today. Mr. Speaker. an individual who didnt sit idly by and quietly when he saw injustices take place here in America. He stood up and was counted for. He wasnt silent and inactive as. unfortunately. the world was in 1994. He stood up. He put his life on the line and said: I must have a voice for the voiceless. He is an American hero whom I. with pleasure. am able to tell my children that I serve in the United States House of Representatives with an American hero. an American icon. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois
1130094762,Mr. Speaker. I come to the floor today to oppose H.R. 4587. the Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act. And while I am deeply troubled by the violence that erupted in Venezuela at the onset of protests months ago. and I join all of the people of Venezuela in mourning the loss of many lives. I also join all the people of Venezuela in the desire to see peaceful protests and a peaceful outcome. and that violence by anyone and everyone cease. I remain committed to doing everything in my power to support a positive outcome in that nation. But I believe vehemently that unilateral action by the United States is not the answer. and that is why this bill is not the right step to take. I know that there are high emotions on all sides of this issue. and I understand why. but the House should not act emotionally. it should act judiciously. This bill does not advance U.S. interests. it will not help the people of Venezuela. and it sends the message to our regional allies that we dont care much about what they think. And these are allies. these are friends. Moreover. the Obama administration has the authority to do what this bill calls for right now. and the administration has shown its willingness to use its authority. So what. then. is our objective? Is it intended to push Venezuela to the brink? What would that do for the Venezuelan people and the region? Now. I have spoken to all of our major allies in the region. and I have yet to hear any support by them for sanctions. but there is strong support for multilateral engagement. Our allies do not want to see the situation in Venezuela worsen. The unilateral sanctions bill we are considering today is misguided in that it is an unfortunate reminder of the history of U.S. arrogance in the Western Hemisphere. We have a legacy in the Americas that is riddled with longlasting consequences. That legacy has left us with a trust deficit. Today. we are considering a bill that does nothing to build that trust. Our standing in our own hemisphere will never improve unless or until we build that trust. While we pursue these sanctions. our allies are actively supporting dialogue. Members of this very body have made it a point to denounce and even condemn some regional organizations. Yet. one of those organizations. along with the Vatican. has managed to be the facilitator of engagement between some of the opposition and some in the Government of Venezuela. UNASUR. in its mediation efforts. continues to urge dialogue between all parties. and it is my sincere hope that dialogue can be successful.
1130114421,"Mr. Speaker. I am proud to sponsor H.R. 3957. I urge its quick and unanimous passage and ask all Members to join me in honoring one of southeast Queens best and a memorable public servant. Cynthia Jenkins. Let me. at this time. also thank my colleagues from the New York delegation who all signed onto this bill. because Cynthia was a history maker. She was the first African American woman in Queens County to be elected to the New York State Assembly. She was elected because of the work that she did prior. For 22 years. she worked as a librarian and made sure that every single library in southeastern Queens would remain open. She. in fact. worked in every library in southeastern Queens. She fought hard on behalf of libraries and those who enjoyed their services. even preventing many branches from closing in a time of cutbacks. She wanted to make sure the children had a safe place to go to learn after school. She also had various programs within the public libraries. As indicated. when servicemembers returned from Vietnam. it was Cynthia Jenkins who played an integral role in opening the State Veterans Home in St. Albans at the veterans facility. That facility still exists and continues to serve thousands of veterans to this very day. In addition. her advocacy on behalf of civil rights was inspiring for many at a time when civil inequality was rampant. She was instrumental in trying to make sure that there was a district where an African American could run for Congress one daythe seat that I hold today. She also was the founder of Social Concern. which took care of young people. older people. and seniors who were frail and had to stay in their homes and helped make sure they got the food and quality health care that they needed. Indeed. Cynthia Jenkins. a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. a member of the community. was a long. hard fighter who did not know how to take ""no"" for an answer when she was trying to make sure that the community received its due. Today. I ask all of my colleagues to honor this public servant who was dedicated to her community. dedicated to libraries. dedicated to literacy. dedicated to the commitment of social and racial equality. and that we unanimously pass this bill memorializing the late Cynthia Jenkins. our assemblywoman."
1130122230,"I want to thank my friend and colleague. a great attorney. a great legislator. for leading this effort this evening. for not only here on the floor of the House of Representatives but for what you do every day. and. in fact. it is an example of what we could follow. how you lead in your district. especially in Brooklyn. Rallying around. as I will talk about later. when you saw a prosecutor not do his job. you were one that led in Brooklyn to say the people will get a peoples prosecutor. And folks went to the polls. When someone said it couldnt be done. where you led and helped make it happen. where an incumbent forgot his way and was not representing the people. you helped people get together to go to the polls and have a new prosecutor in Brooklyn to move forward. We thank you for that leadership. Today we talk about Black in America. What Ferguson says about where we are and where we need to go. Now. as Congressman JEFFRIES has said. I am a former prosecutor. so I know about the grand jury system. I know the failure of the grand jury process directed or. as some would argue. manipulated by county prosecutor Robert McCulloch to indict Police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown. Jr.. an unarmed Ferguson. Missouri. teenager. undermines public confidence in the very notion of equal administration of justice. Now. when you go before a grand jury. all you have to show is that there is probable causeprobable cause. the lowest standard there isthat a crime was committed. And when you see the process that this prosecutor went through. he tried to try a case. or he came in with a preconceived thought that he did not want an indictment here. I dont know of any prosecutors that go into the grand jury and dont at least. after it is all done. ask for an indictment. Mr. McCulloch never asked for an indictment in this case. The tragic circumstances in Ferguson and other unfortunate instances around the country have sparked a movement for justice. equality. and change that I believe is critical to the communities affected by miscarriages of justice. But this movement is not just for those communities. Indeed. the United States of America needs this movement. As others have said. this is an American problem. As Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. once said. ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" Racial disparities of any kind are troubling for our entire Nation. And so. though we have elected President Barack Obama here in the United States. I heard some say that we were in a postracial America. No. we are not. For racism is still alive and well in the United States of America. We have got work to do. So where do we go? This movement. with its courageous contingent of young activists. is quickly learning. adapting. applying. and innovating on the most effective methods and models of the civil rights movements of previous generations. As this movement continues to grow and takes every opportunity to focus its demands. expand its outreach. develop its activists in the discipline of peaceful direct action. and deepen its understanding of how to apply mass pressure on policymakers. it will cascade not simply to interrupt business as usual. but to generate electoral participation on levels unseen in generations. This movement has the potential to transform the tragedy in Ferguson into a historic turning point in the centurieslong struggle for freedom. justice. and equality. The Congressional Black Caucus is part of this moment and is a part of this movement. Tens of thousands of Federal. State. and local elected officials. civic leaders. civil rights organizations. activists. clergies. lawyers. educators. artists. athletes. business owners. and hundreds of thousands. if not millions. of ordinary working people of all ages from all over America are part of this movement. So now is the time for America to come together to reform police practices. redress patterns of racial disparities in the justice system. and to hold police accountable for the use of excessive force. especially deadly force. Now is the time to match nonviolent direct action with meaningful legislative and administrative action. Now is the time for the Federal Government to act. for Congress to act. for courts to act. for State legislatures to act. for county and city governments to act. Now is the time. my friends. to register to vote. because soon. very soon. it will be time to act at the ballot boxes. Only then will these voices be truly heard in every corner of every county and throughout this country. Then the world will know that unwarranted violence and abuse of power has no home in America. injustice has no seat in our democratic institutions. Only then will we honor the sacrifice of those who have paid the ultimate price and begin to heal a Nation of many who aspire to become one. Yes. indeed. we have come a long way. but yes. indeed. we have a long. long. long way to go. I thank the gentleman for the time."
1130125565,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the ranking member for her hard work and focus and dedication for getting this done. I know that any time you have things added to a bill so it is not a clean bill. it makes it difficult. But I thank her and the chairman for working together to make this happen because this is a major bill. significantly important. As we learned. I think. from the impact of the 9111 terrorist attacks. this was substantial. When you look at the losses. it was about $32.5 billion. or $42.9 billion in 2013 dollars. It was the largest insurance loss in global history at that time. And prior to 9111. insurance companies generally covered all of the costs of terrorist attacks. After 9111. terrorism risk insurance quickly became either unavailable or very. very expensive and unaffordable. Furthermore. premiums for workers compensation insurance increased significantly. and real estate and commercial ventures were stalled because of an inability to attain the requisite insurance coverage. Now. 9111 happened in New York. and so. yes. you see New York and New York City Members here supporting the bill. But this is not a bill just about New York. It is about all of America because they did not attack for New York. they attacked New York because it was part of America. We dont know. and we pray that we dont have another attack ever on our homeland again. but it could be someplace else. It doesnt have to be New York. This is when we should rally around as Americans. as patriots. to ensure that we continue our economy flowing and moving. That is why. even though there are things added and certain things that people dont like. we are trying to figure out how we get this right because it is too important to America to allow TRIA to expire. Furthermore. when you examine TRIA. it costs taxpayers virtually nothing. yet it continues to provide tangible benefits to our overall economy. TRIA allows for terrorism insurance market stability. affordability. and availability so that those in business. et cetera. can know. predict. and be confident that we will continue to move on. TRIA is a critical part of the U.S. economys security infrastructure and would ensure a swift recovery in the event of a significant terrorist attack. Now. in New York. I am proud we have the Freedom Towers up because it also sends a message. is a symbol to those who dont like us that you cant keep us down. that we will get back up on our feet. stronger and better than ever. and that is what makes this country the great country that we are going to rally around and work with one another. So this TRIA bill is significantly important. and I ask my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on TRIA."

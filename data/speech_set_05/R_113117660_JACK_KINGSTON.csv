1130025874,Thank you. Mr. Chairman. This bill provides $43.6 billion for medical treatment for the 6.5 million veterans today who use the VA. It increases funding for processes. such as the electronic health record system and the disability claims process. the paperless environment. and yet thats what we did last year and the year before. Nonetheless. today. as we sit here. the VA has 865.265 claims in their backlog. 661/2 percent of these claims have been pending for more than 125 days. The current claim to be processed. the current amount of time is 292 days. and some offices report some claims that have been pending for 450 days. This is not acceptable. But every year we provide more money for the VA to process claims. and every year the backlog gets more. So what this amendment does is it takes a different approach. It takes an approach thats used in the private sector on a regular basis for compensation. It says to the senior members of the VA that if they dont have the claims backlog reduced by 40 percent by next July. the senior leadership will have a pay cut of 25 percent. Mr. Chairman. this follows their own goal. All it says is that if you dont make your own goal. there will be a 25 percent pay reduction for the senior management of the VA. I think everyone in Congress has a VA office with problems in their own district. In Decatur. Georgia. a VA hospital that serves 86.000 patients in the State of Georgia has a backlog of over 4.000or 4.000 patients have fallen through the cracks. Three deaths occurred over the past 2 years when the VA lost track of mental health patients and referred it to a contractor while not keeping a close eye on them while they were supposed to be monitored. One may have committed suicide because he could not see a doctor and had an overdose of his treatment. There are other atrocities that have happened in that one VA clinic. Again. Mr. Chairman. this is not adequate. This is not acceptable. For our veterans. we need to treat them better. I am a member of the Armed Services Committee and often say that the American soldier needs to have the best equipment and the best training thats out there because we want them to fight and win wars. but we also want them to come home and live normal lives. so we need to make sure that our treatment of the American military does not end in a theater of war but continues throughout the rest of their lives. As the claims or as the injuries that they incurred while rendering service to the Nation haunt them for the rest of their lives. we need to be there for them for their medical treatment. This amendment sends a very strong signal to the VA that we are serious that this backlog will be cleaned up and that. if not. there will be a price to pay. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130035469,"Madam Chair. I stand in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Virginia. and I want to start out by clarifying something that was said a minute ago. that this was done by clever Bush administration lawyers. In fact. it was a rule proposed by President Clinton. That would be Democrat President Clinton. a rule proposed by Democrat President Clinton. Now. there was a public comment period. It wasnt done in the dark of the night. but it was done with public comments. and the rule was changed in 2002. which is true that President Bush would have been the President during that time period. But it was an ongoing and a slow and deliberate process. and it was simply a commonsense need that was something that I think was probusiness. which I understand is offensive to some people. But it also streamlines the bureaucracy and helps the private sector create jobs. And all it simply did was get the Corps of Engineers and the EPA to have the same definition of fill. Thats not a radical concept. Thats common sense. And again. if were going to compete in the world marketplace. we should have common sense. even with Washington bureaucrats. Now. the definition includes materials that. when placed into the waters of the U.S.. have the effect of replacing or changing the bottom elevation of any portion of that water. Therefore. it includes rock. sand. soil. clay. plastics. construction debris. wood chips. and overburden from mining. These are regulated right now. Theyre not exempt from this. It simply says that the EPA and the Corps of Engineers would use the same definition. So I stand in opposition to this. And I do not think that this is the purpose of the gentlemans amendment. but I do worry that. as this administration seems to have an open war going on on coal. is this perhaps part of it? Not necessarily this amendment. but the thinking that two different agencies can now get on a different sheet in terms of what a definition is and. therefore. one agency can be more proactive in slowing up progress and activities of which you dont approve. There is an estimation that if this was to happen. 375.000 jobs in the mining business could be jeopardized. Now. I understand. this administration doesnt like mining. but for the rest of us who use the products in the United States of America. this is something that is significant and disturbing. 375.000 jobs in what we have called an anemic recovery already. So I believe that the responsible thing for us to do is to reject this amendment and say that. if this definition does need to be changed. let it not be done by bureaucrats. and let it not be done by lawyers either. but let it be done by the elected representatives. both Democrat and Republican. of the American people. and let 218 of us in the House have a ""yes"" or a ""no"" vote. and then 51 in the Senate. and then send it to the White House for signature. rather than have unelected bureaucrats whom no one knows make these very important significant legal decisions for us. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130064663,Mr. Speaker. one of the great pleasures of serving on the Defense Committee is that we get to be associated with a large number of people who are in the Armed Services. and one such acquaintance and friend is Major Tom E. Lamb. Tom Lamb is the congressional budget liaison for the Army to the Appropriations Committee. does an excellent job in that capacity. He was also the military fellow in our office and got to know the good folks in south Georgia and our staff. and we all grew to love Tom. I am going to submit for the RECORD a number of things about Toms life. but I have got to tell one story about him. And you. Mr. Speaker. as a member of the military. will appreciate this. We were traveling in a remote part of the world and had to make an unexpected stop because of a weather delay in our travel and had to get into a dirt runway in a particular location. and then we had to split up the group because of a weight problem and weather problem and just complications. So one of Toms duties was to reassign people on a new and a different airplane that was a smaller airplane. and he was having trouble getting everybody on board because of the weight issue. And finally. I said to Tom: Tom. what is the problem? I am counting up the number of seats. and there should be enough room. He said: Sir. we have to go by weight. and I have asked each Member of Congress what their weight is and. sir. not everybody is giving me their accurate weight. and so I am having to do a little bit of balancing and avoid embarrassment to everybody. It was just amazing to me that here is this guy. a military officer. an Iraqi and an Afghan veteran. and yet he had the aplomb and the diplomacy to handle a situation like this with a smile. with humor. and get us out of this location by splitting up everybody and not causing any turmoil or friction. That is just a small example of the kind of things that todays military leaders can do. And I know there were a lot bigger issues that he dealt with when he was in Iraq and Afghanistan and. indeed. working in the budget officeI worked with him on lots and lots of different issuesbut Tom Lamb. to me. Mr. Speaker. represents the finest in the military and the finest in the United States of America. I wish Tom and his wife. Emilie. the best in their next duty assignment. Tom. thank you for all the great service you have given the United States Government. the Congress. and our office in particular. Mr. Speaker. I rise to pay tribute to Major Thomas E. Lamb for his extraordinary dedication to duty and service to the U.S. Army and the United States of America. Tom has served for the last 2 years as a Congressional Budget Liaison for the United States Army and will soon depart for his next duty assignment. A native of Washington State. Tom earned his commission at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 2002. As our nations armed forces were at war combating the evils of terrorism. Tom prepared to join that fight soon after graduation. At his first duty assignment with 14 Air Defense Artillery in Germany. Tom deployed and led an infantry scout platoon in combat in Iraq. Following his first combat tour. he then served in the 2nd Infantry Division. forward deployed on Freedoms Frontier in the Republic of Korea from 2004 to 2005. After returning to the United States for five months. Tom again deployed to Iraq in 2006 to serve as a staff officer and deputy commander of a Military Transition Team charged with training Iraqi Security Forces. After a year and a half stateside. Tom deployed once again. this time to Afghanistan in 2009. as a company commander. After returning from his third deployment and a total of 35 months in combat. Tom began his studies as an Army Congressional Fellow. earning a Master of Professional Studies degree in Legislative Affairs from The George Washington University. He was then assigned as a Congressional Fellow in my office and served as my principal advisor on defense matters. He provided critical insight and assistance to me in my role on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. As Representative to four major military installations and the many brave Soldiers. Sailors. Airmen and Marines that call the 1st District of Georgia home. I relied daily on Toms military acumen. He transitioned to the Pentagon for assignment as a Congressional Budget Liaison Officer in the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller where he was tasked with managing the Armys challenging military construction. installations. energy and environmental portfolios. Tom skillfully advised the Armys senior leaders. fostering and strengthening the relationship between the Congress and the United States Army. Major Lambs leadership throughout his career thus far has positively impacted his peers and superiors. Soldiers and civilians alike. As a Congressional Budget Liaison Officer he worked directly with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to inform Representatives. Senators. and staff about the diverse and important Army installations and infrastructure that support the training and well being of our Soldiers. On behalf of a grateful nation. I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending Major Tom Lamb for over a decade of active service in the United States Army. We wish Tom and his wife. Emilie. all the best as they continue their journey of service to our great Nation.
1130070251,and also all of those who voted to move forward where we continue to provide an economic safety net for those people who have lost their job and are actively looking for work. and to continue this economic and social contract which has been part of the way Americans respond to help other Americans at a time when they are down but they shouldnt feel as though they are out. I hope we could put party rancor aside and look at commonsense ways to move this bill forward. In terms of the socalled payfors. I have been here a long time. I have never seen this payfor before on unemployment compensation. particularly for a 90day bill. We are talking about 90 days. and we are already in the middle of January. I hope the two leaders can come together and we can resolve this. On another topic. I wish to report to the Senate some very good news. I rise today as the chair of the Appropriations Committee. and I wish to announce that the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 has completed all its work in the committee process. We have completed our conference and it has been filed in the House and should be considered in the House and Senate this week. What does that mean? First of all. our Appropriations Committee has met the test of the Constitution. Article 1. section 9 of the Constitution directs that there be an Appropriations Committee. although it is not referred to by name. and that every year we review the annual spending of the Federal Government and vote upon it. We also followed the law. By following the law. the law is the bipartisan Budget Act forged by Chairpersons RYAN and MURRAY. We meet the requirements of the Budget Control Act. The Budget Control Act looks at total spending for the Federal Governmentmandatory spending and then discretionary spending. We who are appropriators handle all of the accounts for discretionary spending. Guess what. The Budget Committee puts a cap on us. and that is great. It is a way that we actually have a cap on spending that everybody knows and everybody voted for. So we have a cap by law on discretionary spending of $1.012 trillion for fiscal year 2014. The work of our 12 committees stayed within that cap. and yet we spent the money to meet certain areas. We met compelling needs. We certainly preserved national security. We looked out for our human capital. particularly our children in terms of education. and also invested in physical capitalimproving infrastructureand also the longrange needs of our country by putting public investments into important research and development by $1 billion more in NIH. We also met the mandate of the American people who told us: Work together. Be bipartisan. Work across the aisle and work across the dome. And we did it. They also said: When the bill comes up. dont do it with brinkmanship and dont do it with showmanship. Get the job done in a commonsense way which promotes growth in our country but yet at the same time looks at reducing debt. They said: Dont do showdown politics. And we wont. We will pass it because we have met our deadline. They said: Dont put government on autopilot with something called those continuing funding resolutions. We dont do that either. Every one of our 12 subcommittees is in this comprehensive bill. We dealt with difficult and divisive policy issues. but we did it with diligence and determination. And. I must add. we tried to promote an atmosphere of civility as we did it. It was tense and it was intense. But at the end of the day. we did work pinpointing how to do the job rather than fingerpointing at each other. As I said. negotiations were conducted that way. Our House Appropriations Committee chairmanMr. HAL ROGERS. the gentleman from Kentuckyand I forged this agreement. along with ranking members. my vice chairman Senator SHELBY of Alabama and in the House Congresswoman LOWEY of New York. We didnt do it alone. There was bipartisan agreement of all the subcommittee chairs and over 50 Members of the House and the Senate. We met a very stringent deadline. When we left here on December 20. we had to produce a bill by January 15. That is tomorrow. That is when the continuing resolution expires. We are asking for a 72hour extension. not to finish the job. but so we can do our deliberations on the floor in both the House and the Senate. We worked day and night. I jokingly said during the deliberations: I wish I were as thin as I am stretched. because we really worked at it. Over the holidays our staffs and our subcommittee chairmen worked. The only time they took off was Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. So we thank each and every one of them for their dedication. As I said. this bill required very difficult choices. It meant give and take. It meant more giving on both sides. because there were no big takes. We worked under a very tight budget. $1 trillion. It sounds like a lot of money. and it is. But of the $1 trillion. $600 billion was in the Department of Defense. The other $300 billion was in discretionary spending for all of the domestic agencies. It comes out to like 620 and 380. but those are the rough numbers. So we did meet our national security needs. but we also were very mindful. I was particularly mindful of the social contract with the American people. I wanted to have a bill to help create jobs in this country. not makework but real work. in rebuilding our physical infrastructure on roads and bridges and clean water. I also wanted to look ahead to the longrange needs of our country. in research and discoveries. and not only win the Nobel prizes but win the markets. We expanded our commercial service office to help us promote exports overseas. accelerating manufacturing institutes where government could work with this new emerging dynamic. smallscale manufacturing. I have lost over 12 percent of manufacturing in my State. so manufacturing is important. We wanted to make sure that families felt they had a government that is on their sidefirst of all. helping with school safetyand we have a bipartisan program in here to promote school safetybut at the same time to promote quality childcare and early childhood education. We then made those kinds of investments. all with an eye to getting value for taxpayers. Our colleagues were very clear. and so were the American people: We have to have a more frugal eye. I instructed my colleagues on the Senate side: Lets look at those programs which are dated. duplicative. or dysfunctional. They get a D: dated. duplicative. and dysfunctional. We were able to eliminate many of them. and we will be back at it next year doing a scrub. If you notice. there is no atmosphere of crisis. The other thing that I am proud of in this bill is that we avoided contentious policy riders. I think we have been able to deal with those in a way where they would not be a problem for the other side of the aisle. However. there was one item wrong or one technical mistake in the Budget Committee that I am proud that we were able to fix. This was really at the very top of our agenda. when Mr. ROGERS and I met. We were deeply concerned about the costofliving issue related to military retirees of working age who were disabled or survivors. Their COLAs were mistakenly reduced by 1 percent in the recent budget agreement. This bill. the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014. fixes that problem. It is limited in scope. It is limited to disabled military retirees and survivors of departed servicemembersthe neediest of the needy. We hope. as time moves on. there is a Presidential and DOD commission on pension reform at DOD. and we will have a comprehensive approach and do it. But I want our colleagues to know we were very mindful of these veterans. So we did this fix for military retirees of working age who were disabled or survivors of departed servicemembers. but we also did something else. If you go to the Web site in the House. which has the most detail because it is pending thereit will come up in the Senate when it moves here tomorrowwe really put money into veterans health care. We put money into fixing the veterans disability backlog. I know the Senator from Massachusetts believes that when you are on the front lines you should not have to wait at the back of the line if you are a wounded warrior to get your disability benefits determined. So we pushed for those reforms. and we put the taxpayers dollars behind them because we knew that is the way they would want us to spend their money. We also maintained the veterans education budget because many of our young men and women coming back home who served so well over there need to brush up on education here to move them to jobs here. I hope in voting for this bill people realize it is a vote to support our most vulnerable patriots. to make sure we keep our promises to our veterans. and that we also look at the comprehensive bill that we have moved ahead without rancor. without roar. and we stayed within the budget parameters given to us on a bipartisan agreement. The House will consider this agreement this week. They have sent us over a 3day extension so we could complete our work. I hope we pass it. I would like it to pass tonight or certainly tomorrow. We will be on the floor for ample debate on this bill. and I look forward to answering some questions. But at the end of the day. when all is said and donein this institution often more is said rather than doneyou will know we did get it done. I will have more to say about it when the bill comes to the floor. I yield the floor.
1130116808,Thank you. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker. I want to make three points about the continuing resolution. Number one. as an appropriator. I would be remiss in my duty if I did not say we do not like continuing resolutions. because we on the Appropriations Committee have worked hard to pass our bills. We passed seven off the House floor. and the Senate was unable to move one single bill and. as a result. shut down the appropriations process. The reason Members should be attuned to this is. during the appropriations process. you find out about a lot of programs that need to be discontinued. some that need to be modified. some that need to be enhanced. some that need to be limited altogether. We passed those bills on the House floor through a very vigorous amendment process. and that is a superior way to handle appropriations compared to the continuing resolution method. which just continues programs and really empowers more of the executive branch over the legislative branch. I believe that Chairman ROGERS and Speaker BOEHNER have worked very hard to return this body to the regular order process of 12 different appropriations bills. We were well on our way to having that happen when the Harry Reid Senate shut down the process. and that is why we are here with the CR today. I am hopeful that we can go back into these bills and improve on the continuing resolution. and I do stand in support of it. Number two. let me say this about the bill. It has appropriate and important funding to take on the Ebola virus that has broken out in West Africa. This bill provides $88 million-$30 million for the CDCto put staffers on the ground and to address the needs there and then $58 million to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. which is working on the possibility of 12 different vaccines for Ebola. They are not in the marketplace right now. We do not have a vaccine. and we need to do this research. That is why this amendment has been put in the continuing resolution. and it is something that all Members should be attuned to. I want to remind the Speaker that 2.500 people have already died because of Ebola and that the number who have been infected is somewhere between 3.800 and maybe as high as 4.500. or even higher than that. Getting the number. itself. is very difficult to do. Then. thirdly. let me say this about the use of force in the McKeon amendment that we are having. and I think Members do deserve to have a separate vote on this. It is important for the educational process. It is important for the discussion and the debate for the entire country.
1130117708,I thank the gentleman from Texas for the time. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the McKeon amendment and in support of the continuing resolution. I want to say this: I have heard a lot of people say this process isnt good and that we havent had enough hours of debate. but I would say to Members of Congress: Have we not. in fact. had days and weeks of debate? How is it that you are a Member of Congress if you havent thought about ISIS and the situation? In fact. have we not had 13 years to debate this very subject internally. externally. on the floor. in committee. and off the floor? We certainly have had a lot of time for deliberation on this. Secondly. I want to say this: I am not certain that the President needs further approval from Congress. as I have gone back and read the resolutions of 2001 and 2002. I would also say. though. we should have a formal resolution. It would be good for the country. it is good for Congress. it is good for the education process. and it sends a very strong signal to our enemies. Perhaps when the President sends it to usand I hope he will in November or Decemberwe will have an opportunity to have the debate again. and we can review how effective these airstrikes have been at that time. how effective is the training program. how well is it going. and what allies have actually stepped up and what have they contributed. Right now. we do not have the answer to those questions. I will say another thing. Mr. Speaker: If we are going to fight this war because it is worth fighting. then it is well worth winning. and. speaking for myself. I want the Commander in Chief and our armed services to have all the tools that are available to them. If that means having ground troops on the table. then I want to be sure that we send that signal because the last thing we need to do right now to our enemies abroad is say we are not going to do this or we are not going to do that. We cant have a halfpregnant war. We have got to fight to win and wipe out this terrorist surge.
1130126290,Mr. Chairman. I thank you for all of your leadership and friendship over the years. and your very capable staff as well. Mr. Speaker. I congratulate you on your retirement as well and wish you the best. You know. I came to Washington to cut spending and hold the line on spending. and that is why I am supporting this bill today. This spending level is below last years. When you combine the emergency spending with outlays. this is lower than last year. and it is a lot lower than the year before. So if you want to hold the line on spending. this is a good vote for you. But the second part is the cavalry is coming. and next year there may be more cuts. and there should be more cuts. This bill holds the line on ObamaCare. which is something that we all have fought for. Virtually all Republicans fought to repeal ObamaCare and to end the Presidents amnesty program. No one is backing away from those objectives. There may be a debate on the strategy. but this bill makes sure that those debates will happen and that those votes will happen. again. Mr. Speaker. when the cavalry arrives. This bill moves that debate forward. It is a good thing. It stops risk orders. which keeps the Obama administration from raiding private insurance companies to subsidize ObamaCare. It really hits ObamaCare where it counts. If you do not like ObamaCare. this is a good bill for you to vote for. This bill puts DoddFrank in check. If you are concerned about the overregulation of the financial services industry. this bill challenges DoddFrank. This bill supports our troops. We still have troops in harms way all over the world. This bill supports them and actually increases their pay along the way. This bill puts the EPA in check. The EPA has tried a backdoor power grab on putting a ban on lead in ammunition and fishing tackle. That would increase the cost and make it tougher for the average person to enjoy the great outdoors. This bill puts that in check. This is a good bill. and I urge my colleagues to support it.

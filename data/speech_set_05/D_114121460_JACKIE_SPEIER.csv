1140025270,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their accepting amendments to address military sexual assault. increase oversight. transgender rights. whistleblower protection. and equal access to contraception for military women. but. despite these improvements and many others from my colleagues. I cannot support this bill in its current form. Instead of making tough decisions with our limited resources. this bill uses an accounting gimmick to further parochial and political interests above the readiness of the men and women protecting us and the interests of taxpayers we represent. We chose to address the sage grouse rather than the elephant in the room. By irresponsibly sheltering $38 billionabove the selfimposed budget gapin the OCO account. this bill attempts to decouple national security from economic security. In reality. these are one and the same. Our military leadership gets it. but this seems to be lost on us. Admiral Mullen. former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. stated that the deficit that we are unwisely adding to in this bill is the single greatest threat to our national security. Rather than empowering our military to align our force structure with the capabilities we need. we tied their hands. and. rather than addressing wasteful overhead. needless spare parts. or outdated weapon systems. we chose to ensure that corporations that move their headquarters overseas to avoid taxes continue to get Defense contracts. Provisions of this bill also attempt to force the DOD to keep our detention facility in Guantanamo Bay open. GTMO is a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies. Those arent my words. they are George W. Bushs and 15 to 20 retired generals and admirals. Another provision of this bill prevents the military from saving lives by purchasing alternative fuels. Costly refueling operations and convoys are extraordinarily dangerous. yet. because the existence of climate change is a political talking point. somehow. servicemember safety is second rate. The military is not separate from the rest of the country. Along with defending us. members of the military need to drive on roads that are not crumbling. cross bridges that are not falling. and send their children to public universities that are not bankrupt. It also makes it difficult to fund basic research. which has been a key element to our global competitive advantage and the source of much of the technology that our military relies on. We are choosing to spend vast quantities of money on planes that the military does not want. while refusing to address problems that everyone in the Nation. including military members. needs fixed. We have to face the reality that we cant keep our Nation secure if we let our country rot from the inside. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
1140033681,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Alzheimers disease is a threat to our countrynot a direct threat like ISIS or al Qaeda. but it is an insidious. persistent threat to the minds and bodies of our family members and to the fiscal health of our country. The Alzheimers Association estimates that the cost of caring for people with Alzheimers right now through the Medicare system is $226 billion. By the year 2050. it will be $1.1 trillion. This is a genuine budgetary threat. If it grows unchecked. the cost to Medicare from a single disease will zap our ability to pay for national security. Interestingly enough and timely enough. on the front page of USA Today is a story that reads how 15 percent of seniors account for nearly onehalf of Medicare spending. We also have an epidemic among our soldiers. It is called traumatic brain injury. known as the signature wound of veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq. It affects our soldiers at a much higher rate than the civilian population. and the VA projects its 10year costs at $2.2 billion. TBI is also closely linked to Alzheimers. For 30 years. we have known about a clear correlation between TBI and the risk of developing Alzheimers disease and other types of dementia. By researching the link between TBI and Alzheimers. we can help cure both. I applaud the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on Appropriations for increasing the funding for the Peer Reviewed Alzheimers Research Program from $12 million to its presequestration levels of $15 million. but the funding for Alzheimers research in the United States is still underresourced. Today. I am offering this amendment to increase the funding for the Peer Reviewed Program by $5 million. which would take it up to $20 million. This modest investment on the front end in research can eventually yield billions in savings in the future on the cost of care. That is why I urge my colleagues to support our servicemembers with TBI and Alzheimers and vote ""yes"" on this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California ."
1140086332,Madam Speaker. since 1970. more Americans have died from domestic gun violence than in every war dating back to the American Revolution. If all the victims of gun violence since 1970 were put on a wall like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. it would contain 1.5 million names and stretch 21/2 miles. That is 25 times as long as the actual Vietnam Veterans Memorial. We are quick to hold moments of silence on this floor. but we are not quick to act. I have had enough of Congress failure to lead. So to draw attention to the slaughter going on in this country each and every month. I will recite the names each month of every person killed in a mass shooting during the previous month. I have also created my own memorial wall in the hallway outside of my office. Here are the stories of some of the victims of the 31 mass shootings in March of this year. There have been so many people this month affected by mass shootings. that I dont have time to list the injured. but I recognize the trauma they have endured as well. Deonte Fisher. age 7. was killed sitting in a parked car outside a convenience store on March 4 in Columbus. Ohio. Anthony Renee Beamon. Jr.. age 36. was killed while leaving a party on March 6 in Compton. California. Pablo Villeda Estrada. age 19. was killed at a birthday party on March 6 in Chelsea. Massachusetts. He loved music and was a family jokester. Austin Harter. age 29. Clint Harter. age 27. Jake Waters. age 36. and Michael Capps. age 41. were killed by their neighbor on March 7 in Kansas City. Kansas. The shooter also killed Randy J. Nordman. age 49. the next day while fleeing police. Ishmael Haywood. age 20. and Demontray Keshawn Mackay. age 17. were killed in a car on March 8 in San Antonio. Texas. Jerry Shelton. age 35. Tina Shelton. age 37. Brittany Powell. age 27. Chanetta Powell. age 25. and Shada Mahone. age 26. were killed at a family cookout on March 9 in Wilkinsburg. Pennsylvania. Chanetta was 8 months pregnant. John Smith. age 65. and Jamil Goodwin. age 43. were killed while sitting on their porch on March 11 in Detroit. Michigan. Douglas Hearne. age 48. was killed at a bar on March 12 in Wichita Falls. Texas. Alyric Fouch. age 17. was killed by her mothers boyfriend on March 12 in Elberton. Georgia. She was trying to protect her mother from gunfire. Deosha Jackson. age 19. and Daryl Hunt. age unknown. were killed on March 19 in Wetumpka. Alabama. Serge Pierre Dumas. age 28. was killed at a house party on March 20 in Plantation. Florida. He is survived by his 15monthold son pictured here on this poster next to me. Billie Jo Hettinger. age 32. and her children Collin Hettinger. age 5. and Courtney Hettinger. age 4. were killed by their husband and father on March 20 in Louisville. Kentucky. Kelly Russler. age 39. and her sons Jayden Evans. age 10. and Laing Russler. age 7. were killed by Kellys husband and Laings father on March 21 in Sherman. Texas. Elizabeth Janie Woods. age unknown. was killed by her husband on March 25 in Lauderdale County. Alabama. He also shot their two sons. who were in critical condition but have survived. Virginia State Trooper Chad P. Dermyer was killed by a gunman at a bus station on March 31 in Richmond. Virginia. He was a Marine Corps veteran and had two young children. May the dead rest in peace. the wounded recover quickly and completely. and the bereaved find comfort. Members. colleagues. mothers and fathers. when will we do more than call for moments of silence?
1140089183,"Mr. Speaker. all across the country today. teachers. librarians. and parents will be reading the book ""I Am Jazz."" a childrens book about transgender youth. cowritten by Jazz Jennings. pictured here. and Jessica Herthel. Last year. legal threats from the antiLGBTQ hate group forced a school in Wisconsin to cancel plans to read this book to support a transgender student. The local community rallied. holding a reading at the library that drew more than 600 attendees in support of the student. Now this is a movement. with readings across the country to increase understanding and to show young people that they are welcomed and loved. I am proud to join these readers today from the House floor. Now I am going to read this book. ""I Am Jazz."" I am Jazz. For as long as I can remember. my favorite color has been pink. My second favorite color is silver. and my third favorite color is green. Here are some of my other favorite things: dancing. singing. back flips. drawing. soccer. swimming. makeup. and pretending Im a pop star. Most of all. I love mermaids. Sometimes I even wear a mermaid tail into the pool. My best friends are Samantha and Casey. We always have fun together. We like high heels and princess gowns or cartwheels and trampolines. But I am not exactly like Samantha and Casey. I have a girls brain. but a boy body. This is called transgender. I was born this way. When I was very little and my mom would say. ""Youre such a good boy."" I would say. ""No. mama. Good girl."" E 1015 At first. my family was confused. They always thought of me as a boy. As I got a little older. I hardly ever played with trucks or tools or superheroes. only princesses and mermaid costumes. My brothers told me that that was girl stuff. I kept right on playing. My sister says I was always talking to her about my girl thoughts and my girl dreams and how one day I would be a beautiful lady. She would giggle and say. ""You are a funny kid."" Sometimes my parents let me wear my sisters dresses around the house. but whenever we went out. I had to put on my boy clothes again. That made me mad. Still. I never gave up trying to convince them. Pretending I was a boy felt like telling a lie. Then one amazing day. everything changed. Mom and dad took me to meet a new doctor who asked me lots and lots of questions. Afterwards. the doctor spoke to my parents. and I heard the word ""transgender"" for the very first time. That night at bedtime. my parents both hugged me and said. ""We understand now. Be who you are. We love you no matter what."" That made me smile and smile and smile. Mom and dad told me I could start wearing girl clothes to school and growing my hair long. They even let me change my name to Jazz. Being Jazz felt much more like being me. Mom said that being Jazz would make me different from the other kids in school. but that being different is okay. ""What is important."" she said. ""is that I am happy with who I am."" Being Jazz caused some other people to be confused. too. like the teachers at school. At the beginning of school. they wanted me to use the boys bathroom and play in the boys gym class. but that didnt make me feel normal at all. I was so happy when the teachers changed their minds. I cant imagine not playing on the same team with Casey and Samantha. Even today there are kids who tease me or call me by a boys name or ignore me altogether. This makes me feel crummy. Then I remember that the kids who get to know me usually want to be my friend. They say that I am one of the nicest girls in school. I dont mind being different. Different is special. I think what matters most is what a person is like inside. And inside. I am happy. I am having fun. I am proud. I am Jazz."
1140098510,"Mr. Speaker. these are the facts: Brock Turner was found on top of an unconscious woman whose clothing he had removed. He tried to run away. The woman later found pine needles and dirt in her genitalia. This is also a fact: Brock Turner was sentenced to a mere 6 months in county jail for committing the violent crime of rape. of which Turner will probably serve 3 months. Why? Because the judge said a longer sentence would have a ""severe impact"" on Turner. A severe impact? What a travesty. All I could think of was Proverbs. which says: ""A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain and a corrupt spring."" Our justice system must become better than this. Our educational system must become better than this. People must understand that rape is one of the most violent crimes a person can commit and not as Mr. TURNERS father said. ""20 minutes of action."" I am working on several pieces of legislation to help survivors of sexual assault and harassment. including the HALT Act to strengthen prevention and enforcement efforts on campuses. But today I want to honor the courage of the woman who survived Brock Turners violent assault. Her bravery inspires me. as I hope it will inspire you. I only have time to read an excerpt. but I encourage you to read the entire statement. all 7.000 words. ""You dont know me. but youve been inside me. and thats why were here today."" ""I was found unconscious. with my hair dishevelled. long necklace wrapped around my neck. bra pulled out of my dress. dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist. that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots. legs spread apart. and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognise."" ""You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt. thats twelve votes per count. thirty six yeses confirming guilt. thats one hundred percent. unanimous guilt."" ""Alcohol is not an excuse . . . alcohol was not the one who stripped me. fingered me. had my head dragging against the ground. with me almost fully naked."" ""Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk. the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear. touch you inappropriately. and run away. Thats the difference."" ""How fast Brock swims does not lessen the severity of what happened to me. and should not lessen the severity of his punishment. If a firsttime offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking. what would his sentence be? ""The fact that Brock was an athlete at a private university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency. but as an opportunity to send a message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class."" "". . . to girls everywhere. I am with you. On nights when you feel alone. I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you. I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting. I believe you. As the author Anne Lamott once wrote. +Lighthouses dont go running all over an island looking for boats to save. they just stand there shining. ""Although I cant save every boat. I hope that by speaking today. you absorbed a small amount of light. a small knowing that . . . justice was served. a small assurance that we are getting somewhere. and a big. big knowing that you are important. unquestionably. you are untouchable. you are beautiful. you are to be valued. respected. undeniably. every minute of every day. you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you."""
1140098921,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for giving me the opportunity to speak today about LGBT Pride Month. Pride Month is coming at a crucial time this year. While we have made huge strides in the LGBT community over the last few yearsfrom marriage equality to the introduction of the Equality Actthis year has been a tragic and frustrating reminder of the terrain ahead. Congress has ground to a halt. from legislative appropriations to the National Defense Authorization Act. as too many conservatives remain obsessed with legalizing discrimination from the contracting system to our own bathrooms. They just cant help themselves. We cant do our job right now. and soon we will be leaving for election season without finishing the appropriations process all because conservatives are obsessed with making discrimination legal. Thats right. They want to make discrimination legal. Who are they trying to serve? The American people and corporate America are not standing for this bigoted behavior. Corporations around the country are canceling conventions in States that have passed legislation that prevents transgender bathrooms from being available. At the entryway to my congressional office stands a California flag bearing the rainbow stripes of the LGBT movement. It is a mark of how far we have come that such a flag is now commonplace on Capitol Hill. but on this Pride Month. conservatives are debating how best to overturn antidiscrimination provisions and bar their own constituents from using the restroom. This is absolutely ridiculous. and. frankly. a tragic nadir in congressional action. I am sick and tired of my colleagues saying they oppose discrimination. that they are fighting for LGBT Americans. and that they support equality when time and again they have voted just the opposite way. How about instead of bickering about bathrooms. we look at passing true antidiscrimination laws? Right now we dont have laws preventing housing. credit. workplace. or healthcare discrimination. We have lifted the ban on LGBT military service. but our transgender servicemembers continue to serve in the shadows. never knowing if this will be the day they are dismissed. Now is the time to ban socalled gay conversion therapy that harms so many of our children. Californians. and especially my beloved San Franciscans. have always been at the forefront of this fight for equality. As San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk said when he became one of the first openly gay elected officials. gay children who werent accepted by their parents and peers used to feel they had few options: ""staying in the closet. suicide. And then one day that child might open a paper that says. Homosexual elected in San Francisco. "" That is what Harvey did many decades ago. One option is to go to California. he said. and the other is to stay and fight. That is the fighting spirit we need to keep alive today as we work to make sure our laws live up to the promise of the Declaration of Independence. that all of us. each and every one of us. is created equal and that we should be treated that way. So I thank my colleague again for giving us the opportunity to have this Special Order to talk about Pride Month and the importance of not just being proud that there is a Pride Month. but redoubling our efforts to make sure that these really insidious amendments are not slipped into bills to enforce discrimination. Because that is what they do. They legalize discrimination. We dont stand for that. That is not what this body is about. and that is not what this country is about."
1140099942,"Mr. Speaker. this is what our moments of silence have brought us: A silent nightclub. The only sound is the frantic ringing of cell phones that would never be answered and silent bodies where there should be life. love. and pride. And. here. a silent Congress. Mere words cannot express the depth of my rage and grief. Fortynine lives lost in the middle of Pride Month when they should have been safe and celebrated. Fortynine families devastated by the loss of their loved ones. Fortynine phones ringing and ringing and ringing. There were also frantic texts. like Eddie Justices final message to his mother: ""Mommy. I love you. Hes coming. Im gonna die."" If you can hear these words without your heart breaking. if you can think of those little children gunned down in Newtown without breathing. if you can think of empty pews in Charleston without mourning. then truly you have lost your souls. Hateful people like to compare LBGT equality to the sinfilled Biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. but we here in Congress are the real Sodom and Gomorrah. Are there not 218 Members here to stand against this bloody tide? I ask you today: How many lives must be destroyed before Congress acts? Nine lives? Charleston showed us nine is not enough. Thirteen lives? Columbine showed us that 13 was not enough. Certainly. 27 small children killed in their classrooms in Newtown? No. not enough. The 32 lives lost at Virginia Tech. again. not enough lives. The more than 33.000 Americans killed each year by guns. not enough. Now 49 people have been mowed down and murdered in Orlando. yet even this historic tragedy. the biggest mass murder since 9111. hasnt been deemed big enough. horrific enough. or insidious enough to break the weakkneed. spineless. silent Members of Congress. Congress is happy to debate for hours about bathrooms. but bring up the gun violence killing of thousands? Absolutely not. Radical Islam or homegrown American homophobia or a toxic stew of both may have inspired the Orlando shooter. No doubt we will learn about his disgusting motivations in the coming weeks. But there are simple actions we can take right now. actions that would have reduced the deaths in Orlando as well as in Aurora. Newtown. San Bernardino. and at Umpqua Community College. All these killers use AR15s. All of them used weapons of mass destruction. First. lets make sure every gun purchase requires a background check rather than just 60 percent of gun purchases. Why have we created a separate market for criminals. domestic abusers. and mentally ill? Lets ban assault weapons that have time and time again caused mass bloodshed. The American people are too familiar with the AR15. a weapon designed to hunt Americans in their most vulnerable places: the classroom. the movie theater. the nightclub. Whether the wouldbe killers are Islamic extremists or American White supremacists or disgruntled coworkers. banning assault weapons would prevent mass bloodshed on the scale we saw last weekend in Orlando. Motive doesnt matter without the means. Finally. we must lift the ban on gun violence research. Our best minds should have access to gun violence statistics and be encouraged to study ways to stem the tide of violence. The Second Amendment cannot be abridged by basic scientific studies. Would these policies stop all gun violence? Of course not. But I am repulsed by the moments of silence that just are for show. No other industrialized country has such bloodsoaked streets. By remaining silent. we are complicit in these crimes. To the Latino and LGBT communities that are dealing with this unimaginable tragedy. I mourn with you and stand with you against this tide of hatred. To my colleagues. I plead with you. please. stop the idolatry of weapons of death."
1140105655,Mr. Speaker. I want to associate myself with the outstanding comments of my colleague from Massachusetts . I couldnt agree with him more. I am. proudly. a member and cochair of our task force against gun violence. I proudly support every Americans right to own a firearm. I believe as strongly as anyone in this room that all we are trying to do here is get a vote. a simple votelet the votes fall where they maya simple vote on closing loopholes as they relate to background checks and making sure terrorists cant buy guns if they cant even fly. Now. over the last many months. I have spent many 5minutes talking about all those who have died because of mass shootings in this country. I have a memorial wall outside my office that is filling up quite quickly with all the lives that have been lost because of mass shootings. During our sitin on the House floor last week. we read the names of those in Orlando who were victims. Today. I am going to remember the 54 other victims last month in 51 other mass shootings that took place in the month of June. Even excluding Orlando. so many people last month were affected by mass shootings that I dont have time within my 5 minutes to list those who were injured but survived. Here are those who died in mass shootings in June that were not victims in Orlando: Devonne Burton. 28. Sean Pointe. 27. and Derrius Woods. 27. were killed on June 4 in Denver. Colorado. Brian Harris. 44. and Robert Sykes. also 44. were killed when a gunman opened fire in a motel on June 5 in Phoenix. Arizona. Jeremy Taylor. 54. and Sean Strickland. 26. were killed when a gunman opened fire in a convenience store on June 7 in Cape Coral. Florida. Raekwon Brown. 17. was killed outside a school on June 8 in Dorchester. Massachusetts. Adrian Potts. 20. was killed outside of a university apartment complex on June 11 in Charlotte. North Carolina. Stephanie Gonzalez. 17. and her sister. Kimberly Gonzalez. 13. were killed by their mothers exboyfriend on June 11 in Los Angeles. California. The shooter also wounded their mother and brother. Cynthia Villegas. 34. and her daughters. Yamilen. 14. Cynthia Janeth. 11. Abby. 7. and Ida. 3. were killed by their husband and father on June 11 in Roswell. New Mexico. An unidentified 30yearold man was killed outside an ice skating park on June 11 in Stockton. California. Reggina Jefferies. 16. was killed as she was attending a memorial service on June 14 in Oakland. California. She had just performed a praise dance honoring two boys who drowned. Robert Marto. 54. and Jason Moore. 41. were killed outside of a bar on June 18 in Warren. Ohio. Cameron Wilkins. 21. and Felicia Williams. 32. were killed in a housing complex on June 18 in Waycross. Georgia. Cameron had seven children. Ronald Graves. 30. was killed in a house on June 19 in Exmore. Virginia. Gary Porter. 41. was killed at a party on June 19 in Syracuse. New York. He had four children. Monte Compton. 24. and his cousin. Donte Jefferson. 29. were killed on June 21 in Louisville. Kentucky. Gerald Berkey. 36. Jackson Edens. 28. and Terron McGrath. 31. were killed in a trailer on June 22 in Lacey. Washington. Terron leaves behind two daughters. 8 and 12. An unidentified man was killed on June 22 in DeKalb County. Georgia. Carlina Renee Gray. 50. Jan Marie Parks. 55. and Allen Rowlett. 60. were killed on June 24 in District Heights. Maryland. Treavon Lewis. 22. and Jordan Larkin. 18. were killed at a dance club on June 25 in Fort Worth. Texas. Fernando Wingfield. 44. was killed outside a bar on June 26 in Atlanta. Georgia. An unidentified man was killed on June 26 near a pool in Houston. Texas. Ruben RigobertoReyes. 60. Edmundo AmaroBajonero. 26. and Katie Gildersleeve. 30. were killed on June 27 on a blueberry farm in Woodburn. Oregon. Phoukeo DejOudom. 35. and her children. Dalavanh. 15. Xonajuk. 14. and Anhurak. 9. were killed by their husband and father on June 29 in Las Vegas. Nevada. Chanda Foreman. 37. was killed while sitting in her car on June 30. in Chicago. Illinois. It was her birthday and she was going out to celebrate. This carnage must end. Just give us a vote on two modest bills to help stem the bloodshed.
1140111776,"Mr. Speaker. tonight we are going to talk about pork ships. Now. you may be scratching your head. What is a pork ship? Well. a pork ship was a name coined by POLITICO. Some may think. well. maybe that is a creative barbecue dish. Or military historians might say: Well. maybe it has something to do with the Bay of Pigs. Others might think it is an Oscar Mayersponsored cruise liner. But all those guesses would be wrong. The term actually applies to a chronically unreliable ship. the littoral combat ship. Well. how unreliable is this ship? In just the last 9 months. four of the six ships that we have built as Littoral combat ships have been in trouble. They have broken down. As a member of the Armed Services Committee. I have been working to rein in this program for years. Unfortunately. the ships manufacturers and some Members of Congress seem intent on throwing good money after bad. The LCS has cost us almost $20 billion so far. $20 billion for six ships. But we have many more that we are going to build that are going to be flawed and that will break down. So the total cost of the ships over the course of the program is a mindblowing $120 billion. That is right. $120 billion. Now. we are scraping right now to find enough money for the defense budget. We are scraping right now to come up with $2 billion to protect Americans from the Zika virus. Meanwhile. we are spending truckloads of money on ships that dont float. Now. maybe I am being a little hyperbolic here. but I am going to follow through by talking about the history of the ship. The ship is so poorly conceived that even the name. littoral combat ship. doesnt fit. The term ""littoral"" means that the ship should be able to operate along the shoreline. Yet. Navy officials have admitted that they havent studied carefully enough whether the LCS is the right ship for warfare in shallow waters. Combat. Combat isnt accurate either since the Defense Departments Testing Office has said the LCS is not survivable in combat settings. Littoral combat ship. It doesnt meet the term ""littoral."" It doesnt meet the term ""combat."" And considering that one of these ships spent 58 percent of a 10month deployment idle in a port. we might suggest that maybe it is not even a ship. The Navy now wants to call it something else. Since this grand scheme that was concocted back in the 1990s doesnt quite fit today. lets just rename it a frigate. So what is a frigate? A frigate is a heavy. slow. and survivable ship. The littoral combat ship meets the heavy because it is much heavier than it was supposed to be. It is much slower than it is supposed to be. but it is not survivable. So the question then becomes: What are we doing? We are never going to get back the nearly $20 million we have already appropriated on that vessel. but are we going to spend extraordinary sums of money on something that didnt meet the initial expectations and has proven over and over again that it is not working? Lets talk about the evolution of the LCS and how we got to this point. One of the primary reasons for building the LCS was to increase the size of the Navy by building smaller and presumably cheaper vessels. However. there was never a consistent agreement on the LCS mission. Military correspondent David Axe has called the LCS ""Frankensteins warship"" and questioned whether the LCS should be a heavily armored combat vessel. a mine clearer. a submarine hunter. a lowcost patroller. How about a small. fast amphibious ship? It was apparently meant to be all those things. yet we seem to have ended up with a ship that can do none of these things. Since the Navy didnt conduct rigorous analysis on the ship until billions of dollars were already spent. they were building it without a strategic plan. As a result. the LCS program has changed its fundamental acquisition plannow. get thisfour times since 2005. [ 1745 We now have a ship that is less survivable and less lethal than originally planned. The real threshold question is: Do we really want to put our sailors lives at risk on a vulnerable ship? That should be the threshold question. If this ship is so plagued with flaws and is not survivable in combat. are we not putting our sailors at risk? On top of the fact that the LCS is struggling to perform its intended missions. it is turning out to be the proverbial lemon. As detailed by a Politico article in July. the ships maiden voyages have been marked by cracked hulls. engine failures. unexpected rusting. software glitches. and weapons malfunctions. So lets start with February 2011. Here we are. What happened there? In February 2011. the USS Freedom sprung a 6inch crack in its hull that required several months worth of repairs. All right. that is the USS Freedom. Now we are in June 2011. just a few months later. and we find that the USS Independence has suffered severe corrosion and has been sidelined. In December 2012. the Defense Departments director of operational test and evaluation released a report saying: ""The LCS is not expected to be survivable . . . in a hostile combat environment."" Now. this is the office within the Department of Defense within the Department that is charged with making sure our weapons are safe. effective. and accurate. and the testing office is saying: Do you know what? It is not survivable. In July 2013. the USS Freedom was. once again. immobilized during a trial run. So it has got two strikes now. Also in July of 2013. the GAO urged Congress to restrict the purchase of new LCS until the Navy completed technical and design studies and figured out how much it will cost to fix the vessels problems. These were very good suggestions. Now. we pay these departments to make these recommendations. But guess what. We just ignored it. We move from July 2013 to December 2014. Secretary of Defense Hagel directed the Navy to study ways to improve the program. However. the Navy doubled down on its failed strategy and prioritized costs and schedule considerations over mission requirements. In December 2015. the USS Milwaukeeyet another LCSbroke down and had to be towed 40 miles after a software malfunction. In the same month. Secretary of Defense Carter directed the Navy to cut the program which would save billions of dollars. Once again. Congress resisted these efforts. Another LCS. the USS Fort Worth. in January 2016 was sidelined because its operators failed to follow proper maintenance procedures. In June of this year. GAO recommended Congress not fund any LCS for 2017. So what did Congress do? In a strained budget. did we heed the GAO? No. No. we didnt. The NDAA authorized not one. not two. but three new shipsthree new shipsadding $1.5 billion to the budget. Now. this is after the GAO said: Do not authorize any more LCS this year. What did we do? We actually upped the departments request of two to three. But there is more. In July of this year. the USS Freedomoh. my God. the third timeyet again encountered more mechanical issues. How bad is it? This time its engine will need to be rebuilt or replaced. This is a $400 million ship that has been in dock. paralyzed. and towed in three times already. and now we are being told we have to replace or rebuild the engine. Then most recently. yet anotherthere are only six of them. mind you. and five of them have had problems. In August of this year. the USS Coronado broke down because of an engineering problem. Despite all of these problems and all of these warnings. what do we do in Congress? We continue to throw money at this ship. Lemons may float in water. but this lemon of a ship evidently does not. and it is taking taxpayer money to the bottom of the ocean with it. Even the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. JOHN MCCAIN. has questioned the LCS program. demonstrating that this is not a partisan issue. Members. we have a responsibility to take care of the taxpayers dollars. It makes you wonder why certain House Members are so committed to not just sustaining. but boosting the LCS production. Arent we supposed to be prudent with taxpayer money? The answer may be looking at what the shipbuilders were doing in Washington from January to March of this year. During that time. these shipbuilders were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby Congress. Do you know what? I bet we are all paying for that in the bottom line of that particular contract. I experienced firsthand what that money can buy when I attempted to introduce an amendment to the FY 2017 Defense Appropriations bill that would have reduced the total ships purchased from three to two for this fiscal year. Now. the Rules Committee apparently decided that my amendment was not germane to the bill. I mean. truly. that is right. An amendment on defense spending was deemed not relevant to a defense spending bill. This wasnt an absurd proposal either. it was in line with the Presidents budget request. It certainly wasnt a poison pill. That one ship represented only about 0.06 percent of the total defense budget. In hindsight. I should have followed GAOs recommendation to not fund any LCS next year. I thought only going with two ships was a fair compromise. We wont know because we werent even allowed to vote on it. That is what we do here. We avoid voting on controversial issues. But that is our job. and this is more than just controversial. This is spending taxpayer money and spending it poorly. Even LCS shipbuilder Lockheed Martin must have been surprised that my amendment never reached the House floor. They had already sent out a letter urging a ""no"" vote on it. Now. as I mentioned. it never even got considered because it was held to be nongermane in a defense spending bill. But their arguments for voting against the amendment are about effective as a littoral combat ship is at a littoral combat. which is to say not very. Lockheed said that if we reduced the LCS program. the Navy would be ""unable to sustain fleet capability and meet global requirements."" However. the Secretary of Defense said that cutting the LCS would actually improve our naval forces by allowing us to invest in more pressing needs. Lockheeds letter also said that we shouldnt reduce the LCS program because ""ship count is crucial for the Navy to meet its tactical missions."" Ship count may be an important measurement of capability. but we should not be spending billions of dollars just to reach an arbitrary ship number. especially if those ships arent survivable in combat or stall out on the open seas and have to be towed back to port. But that is what we are funding. We are funding flawed ship design. and we are funding flawed ships that are costing us a truckload of money. Lockheed also maintains if we cut the program it would force the shipyards to shut down. But that is not even true. The GAO says both companies who work on the LCS variants already have enough work on the books to keep their shipyards running to the year 2021. Fortunately. there is still an opportunity to salvage some savings from this shipbuilding program. The NDAA conference committee has been meeting to discuss provisions for the final bill. The Senate version supports Secretary Carters directive to reduce the number of LCS. As a member of the conference committee. I have argued for the adoption of this provision. Cutting the total number of ships will save billions of dollars of taxpayer money over the long run. As wasteful and as unnecessary as this program has been. it is just the tip of the iceberg of Congress forcing the Defense Department to spend taxpayer money on weapons it does not want and only seem to benefit certain industries. For example. the House NDAA bill redirects $18 billion in critical funding for wartime operations towards programs the Defense Department did not request. As a result. the bill would only fund the Defense Department through next April. effectively sidestepping the Bipartisan Budget Act compromise signed onto by both Republicans and Democrats that we reached just last year and putting funding for combat operations at risk. In any budget environment. this is not the way we should be doing business. but House Republicans think nothing of engaging in these wasteful and irresponsible budget shenanigansand some Democrats. too. Now. I am all for Congress revisiting budget caps and looking for waste and areas where spending and support should be increased. But I do not support cutting funding to crucial. existing programs to fund programs the military doesnt even want. Furthermore. should we be funding programs and should we be funding weapons that have not been fully tested. as the LCS is. that has already shown that it is flawed. that has already shown that five out of the six ships that are afloat have had problems. and they are big problems? Whom do we work for? Do we work for big business. or do we work for the American people? Throwing taxpayer money at failed programs solely for the benefit of industry is not how we should be operating. I am going to stop here. I am joined by my colleague from Minnesota. He is one of the most outspoken people in this Congress on issues around fairness in budgeting. and I am grateful that he is here. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota ."

1140022912,Madam Chair. let me begin by thanking Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR for the work that they have done. a very challenging and popular appropriations when it comes to energy and water and also the issues of the environment. I have a very simple amendment that reinforces our commitment to communities from rural America to urban America. from hamlets and villages to large urban centers. And it simply emphasizes a quality of life: for all Americans to have a good. clean environment. to reduce asthma in children. to help senior citizens. and to have a good quality of life in their sunset years. in their older homes. in older communities. of which I represent. is an important funding necessity for this Nation. I want to emphasize the work that has been done and remind my colleaguesfor those of us who had the privilege of being herethat President Clinton issued an executive order directing Federal agencies to address the disproportionately high and adverse human health environmental impacts on minority and lowincome populations. which covered rural America. which oftentimes experienced the impact of the environment. We have worked over the years to improve their quality of life. and today I ask that we continue to do so. In particular. I want to refer to a project in Houston. Texas. called the CAS site. That site was attempted to be cleaned up. It is in an older neighborhood. Madam Chair. Senior citizens own their homes. They have been there for a long time. There have been a lot of machinations about this entity that is espousing chemicals. leaking chemicals because it is old and closed down and abandoned. And we had to call upon the environmental justice sector in the Federal Government to provide the leverage to help these senior citizens. people who did not want to move from their homes. I walked those streets. went into the backyards of senior citizens and saw the seepage coming out of the ground and. as well. coming in from the property on the back side. Environmental justice is a good thing. and it is through those efforts that we are working with the EPA to give hope to these citizens that they can stay in their homes. I live in the energy capital of the world. It is a jobcreator. But on occasions. in the midst of our wetlands and our areas of pristine. if you will. environmental assets. we have some ups and downs. Just recently. I flew over the Houston port at the time of a spillage that was impacting some of our most environmentally important areas. including wetlands and areas that are protected or are important to the environment and to the quality of life. So I am asking that the Jackson Lee amendment be accepted for the importance of providing for the continued support of environmental justice and equality for areas that are both urban and rural. Let me finish by making this statement. Madam Chair. This is an important cause because. as we look at the funds that are dealing with environmental justice. they increase youth involvement through science. technology. engineering. and math. They also help to promote clean energy. weatherization. cleanup. asset revitalization. and they help my constituents and the constituents of so many in this body whose older neighborhoods are sometimes impacted by older entities that are left behind in the neighborhood where seniors continue to live. I want to be able to walk those neighborhoods and make sure that my seniors can stay in their homessmall frame homesand make sure that as they stay in their frame homes. that they will have the quality of life that all of us would like. Again. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member. This is a tough job to do. And I would like to emphasize the importance of the funding for environmental justice and helping to continue. if you will. to put focus and emphasis on quality of life for homeowners. seniors. and people living in rural America and urban America. Madam Chair. I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment to preserving Americas great natural environment and resources so that they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come. My amendment increases funding for DOE departmental administration by $1.000.000 which should be used to enhance the Departments Environmental Justice Program activities. Madam Chair. the Environmental Justice Program is an essential tool in the effort to improve the lives of lowincome and minority communities as well as the environment at large. Twenty years ago. on February 11. 1994. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898. directing Federal agencies to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and lowincome populations. A healthy environment sustains a productive and healthy community which fosters personal and economic growth. Maintaining funds for environmental justice that go to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. MinorityServing Institutions. Tribal Colleges. and other organizations is imperative to protecting sustainability and growth of the community and environment. The funding of these programs is vital to ensuring that minority groups are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the environment and the continued preservation of their homes. Through education about the importance of environmental sustainability. we can promote a broader understanding of science and how citizens can improve their surroundings.
1140032833,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time. First of all. let me again say that in the Judiciary Committee. we have consistently worked together on issues dealing with the Internet. continue to work together on issues dealing with innovation. so I would hope as this bill makes its way to the Senate we will find an opportunity to work together again. But I want to make mention of the fact that in addition to Texas. Wisconsin will lose about $127 million. Ohio will lose about $65 million. and South Dakota will lose about $13 million. Should this bill become law. State and local governments will have to choose whether they will cut essential government services. such as educating our children. maintaining needed transportation infrastructure. and providing essential public health and safety services. or shift the tax burden onto other taxpayers to increase property income and sales taxes. Now let me be very clear: I am not interested in taxing the Internet. I am interested in the process that most States are utilizing. It is the purchase of items that juxtapose against those who have bricks and mortar. and particularly small businesses. Meanwhile. the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated that the permanent moratorium will deny the nongrandfathered States of almost $6.5 billion in potential State and local sales tax revenuesales tax. not access to the Internet. H.R. 235 will burden taxpayers while excluding an entire industry from paying their fair share of taxes. I want this industry to grow. and. again. I do not want taxing on access. You can be on the Internet from morning until the early sunrise again. the next day. But for those States who have worked and worked with our committee. trying to find a pathway forward. I would like to see us find a compromise. Finally. this bill ignores the fundamental nature of the Internet. The original moratorium was intentionally made temporary to ensure Congress. industry. and State and local governments would be able to monitor the issue and make adjustments where necessary to accommodate new technologies and market realities. such as acts. The act was intended as a temporary measure to assist and nurture the fledgling Internet that back in 1998 was still in its commercial infancy. yet this bill ignores the significantly changed environment of todays Internet. The bills supporters continue to believe that the Internet still is in need of extraordinary protection in the form of exemptions from State taxation. but the Internet of 2015 is drastically different from 1998. It is standing on its own two legs. It is not a toddler. It is a fullgrown adult. Permanently extending the tax moratorium severely limits Congress ability to revisit and make any necessary adjustments. though I hope we will. Simply put. the permanent moratorium is unwise. and I urge my colleagues to consider the problems of H.R. 235. H.R. 235. I think. should be addressing these issues dealing with the many who have opposed it. Let me. as I close. mention that the National Governors Association recently introduced the following statement: ""The National Governors Association is disappointed that the House Judiciary Committee is moving to make the Internet access tax moratorium permanent."""
1140052304,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. quite the contrary to my good friend from Virginia. what this amendment does is protects the process of the NRC to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities as well. In addition. I think when we hear the names Chernobyl. Fukushima. and Three Mile Island. we understand the vast and devastating impact of such an incident that may be caused or driven by terrorism. I would not want to limit the NRC. which has been given court authority by law to investigate and provide an investigation. thorough investigation. on the impact on chemical and nuclear plants. and we have it restricted. It takes more than 4 years to build a nuclear facility. So are you suggesting that the facility. then. can go on and be built for 10. 20 years. and we shut off the NEPA that has the responsibilities for the American people? I dont think that is appropriate. Mr. Chairman. let me suggest that the American people from the Alaska Wilderness League. the Natural Resources Defense Council. and the Western Environmental Law Center are against this bill. I will place this into the RECORD. Mr. Chairman. the Executive Office of the President. Council on Environmental Quality is opposed to this bill. and I will insert this into the RECORD. I just want to mention that. of course. the President has issued a veto threat. Where this bill is going. I do not know. But the main thing I would like to say to my colleagues is: Cant we stand together united around the question of national security? My amendment specifically indicates that this issue of terrorism should be a simple carveout. and I would ask you to do so. Let me also bring in the comments of the Pope as indicated yesterday: If politics must truly be at the service of the human person. it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. Politics is. instead. an expression of our compelling need to live as one in order to build. as one. the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share. in justice and peace. its goods. its interests. and its social life. The interest of the American people is to accept the Jackson Lee amendmentto carve out an exception in this bill that is opposed by the President and all other aspects of goodwill people here dealing with the environmentto deal with this issue. Might I remind you. Mr. Chairman. of the Volkswagen scandal. If a more robust process had been in mind. 11 million owners of Volkswagensand 400.000 in the United Statesmight be in a better place. This is a good amendment dealing with the safety and security of the American people. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.
1140056813,Mr. Chair. I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 10. the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act. H.R. 10 would reauthorize the District of Columbia private school voucher program. the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP). for five years through 2021. H.R. 10 would reauthorize the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act. which provides Federal support for improving traditional public schools in the District of Columbia (D.C.). expanding and improving highquality D.C. public charter schools. and offering private school vouchers to a limited number of students. The Obama Administration continues to strongly oppose the private school vouchers program within this legislation. known as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. Members of the House should respect the self determination of the residents of DC by not forcing education policy onto children or their families at taxpayer expense. Rigorous evaluation over several years demonstrates that D.C. vouchers have not yielded statistically significant improvements in student achievement by scholarship recipients compared to other students not receiving vouchers. In addition. H.R. 10 would extend this voucher program to a new population of students previously attending private schools. Instead of using Federal resources to support a handful of students in private schools. the Federal Government should focus its attention and available resources on improving the quality of public schools for all students. Mr. Chair. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this bill. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule. the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5minute rule. The amendments recommended by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform printed in the bill are adopted and the bill. as amended. shall be considered as read. The text of the bill. as amended. is as follows: H.R. 10 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.
1140074052,"Let me first thank Congresswoman BEATTY for her very kind and humbling remarks. but also for her tremendous leadership on so many issues. not only since she has been here in Congress. but before she came representing her constituents. and really looking out for. speaking out for. and working for the most vulnerable in our society. I am really proud of what she is doing with the Congressional Black Caucus. also Congressman JEFFRIES for continuing to organize these important sessions really to beat the drum and to allow our country to understand what the issues are that the Congressional Black Caucus continues to work on because if. in fact. we address those issues. as you know. that the most vulnerable are dealing with each and every day. we will strengthen America. and so our country will be stronger. I thank both of them for making sure that we are doing that. We celebrate tonight the start of Black History Month. but I would like to reflect quickly again what we are doing tonight on Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.s dream of true democracy. In his famous speech. ""I Have a Dream."" let me just quote here what he asked the American people to do. He said: ""To make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. ""Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all Gods children. ""Now is the time to lift our Nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood."" Of course and sisterhood. As I think about his powerful words going into Black History Month and his challenge for America to live up to her highest ideals. we must reflect on how far we have come and where we need to go. Now. of course. the right to vote is the bedrock of our democracy. which Dr. King reminded us of when he said: ""Give us the ballot. and we will fill our legislative halls with men and women of goodwill."" In his honor. we must pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act. H.R. 2867. introduced by a great woman. a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Congresswoman TERRI SEWELL. In 1967 Dr. King explained the underlying nature of the challenges facing our country in his book ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos Or Community?"" he talked about these triple evils. He wrote about poverty. racism. and war. He said they are the forms of violence that exist in a vicious cycle in our country. He says: ""They are interrelated. allinclusive. and stand as barriers to our living in the beloved community. When we work to remedy one evil. we affect all evils."" So we must come together as never before to address these issues that infect our communities in order for our Nation to move beyond the quicksands of racial and economic injustice. Of course. the first of these evils is poverty. a harsh reality lived every day by more than 46 million Americans. Our Joint Economic Committee report. championed by Congresswoman MALONEY and the Congressional Black Caucus. demonstrated and showed that African Americans are disproportionately affected by the scourge of poverty. The poverty rate in our community is 27 percent. One in three African American kids live in poverty. One in five kids in the entire country live in poverty. Poverty rates throughout our country are much too high for everyone. and we know how to eliminate poverty. Our assistant leader. a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. a great human being who has worked so hard to eliminate poverty for so many years has come up with a formula that would target resources to those rural and urban communities with the highest rates of persistent poverty. We have our Half in Ten Act. which establishes a national strategy to cut poverty in half over the next decade. That is more than 22 million Americans lifted into the middle class in just 10 years by coordinating local. State. and Federal antipoverty programs. Likewise. our Pathways Out of Poverty Act is a comprehensive antipoverty bill that starts by creating goodpaying jobs while redoubling our investments in proven programs that empower families to build pathways out of poverty into the middle class. Of course. Dr. King mentioned the second evil. which is racism. While racial barriers and biases are endemic through our society. they are very and most apparent in our broken criminal justice system. It is high time that we work to fix our criminal justice system that far too often fails African Americans. Yes. Black lives matter. So today in America. an African American is killed by a security officer. police officer. or selfproclaimed vigilante every 28 hours. That is nearly once a day. One in three Black men can plan to spend at least some part of their life behind bars. and men of color make up 70 percent of the U.S. prison population. Let me say that again. Seventy percent of the U.S. prison population are men of color. That is simply outrageous. Now. we have ended legal segregation. Our first African American President is serving his second term in the White House. Our Attorney General. Loretta Lynch. serves as our first African American female Attorney General. But so much must be done to achieve the dream of liberty and justice for all. Dr. King told us over and over again that we live in two Americas. This was in 1967. in one of his speeches. The Kerner Commission report still describes American society today. We have got to really look at our history and acknowledge and honor the legacy of those who really brought us this far. But when you look at the statistics and what is taking place now in communities of color and the African American community. it just shows us what we have to do. We have a long way to go. Dr. King finally spoke of war. He talked about the fact that our Nation continues to be involved in endless wars. and communities are suffering the costs. The Pentagon consumes 60 percent of discretionary spending compared to 11 percent that we spend on education. job creation. and resources to help our young people live the life that they so deserve in terms of being educated and providing workforce training. housing. health care. all the opportunities that are the American opportunities to allow us to live the American Dream. Congresswoman BEATTY and Congressman JEFFRIES. I just Want to thank you for arranging the time for us to talk tonight. We have real solutions. You have real solutions. Every member of the Congressional Black Caucus has real solutions to end poverty. to end racism. and to end war. During Black History Month. we need to recommit ourselves to all of the solutions that members of the Congressional Black Caucus. and Members of this body as a whole. have if the political will were there so we can honor the legacy of those who came before us during Black History Month. By honoring them. we say we are going to pick up that mantle and really address these triple evils once and for all."
1140075994,"Mr. Speaker. as a proud cosponsor I rise in strong support of H.R. 2915. the ""Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act."" which directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to implement mental health care and suicide prevention programs and identify metrics that are effective in reducing the incidence of suicide among female veterans. Over the last decade suicide has become a major issue for the military. but the research has been predominantly focused on men and too much remains unknown about the cause and frequency of suicide among female veterans. Mr. Speaker. several recent studies show that. unfortunately. female military veterans commit suicide at nearly 6 times the rate of other women. The suicide rate among female veterans is so high that it approaches that of their male counterparts. a finding that surprises researchers because men generally are far more likely than women to commit suicide. The highest rates of suicide are found among young female veterans. ages 1829. who are 12 times more likely to commit suicide as their civilian counterparts. This is heart breaking. but perhaps not unexpected. since reports indicate that 10% of women serving on active duty are victims of rape and another 13% were subjected to other unwanted sexual contact. Mr. Speaker. in every other age group. including women who served as far back as the 1950s. suicide rates for female veterans are between 4 and 8 times higher than that of their civilian counterparts. These trends are so disturbing that it has earned the sobriquet from the Houston Chronicle as ""The Silent National Epidemic."" The Texas Department of State Health Services lists a decedents military experience in his or her death record. regardless of whether the deceased was serving in the armed forces at time of death. While it is not clear what is driving the rates of female veteran suicides. the consistency across age groups suggests that a statistically significant correlation exists between gender and military service but the sad truth is that we lack sufficient data to generate externally valid inferences about causation. In the general population. women attempt suicide more often than men but succeed less because women usually use pills or other methods that are less lethal than firearms. Female veterans. however. are more likely than other women to possess firearms. and more likely to use a firearm to commit suicide (40% compared to 34% of civilian women). H.R. 2915 is intended to make progress in identifying the causes and reducing the incidences of suicide by female veterans. The bravery and devotion of female veterans. who have provided heroic service to our nation. often at great personal costs. is unquestioned. We owe it to them to be there when they need our help just as they were there to answer the call when their country needed them. I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 2915. the ""Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act."""
1140090781,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3680 the ""CoPrescribing To Reduce Overdoses Act of 2015."" This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a grant program to support prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs. such as naloxone. for patients at an elevated risk of overdose. including patients prescribed an opioid. Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium. such as heroin and certain pain medications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 259 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012. more than enough for every adult in the United States. In 2013 nearly 4.5 million people in the United States without a valid medical need were using prescription painkillers. Both states and the federal government have begun responding to this growing public health crisis. The Obama administration has awarded $94 million to community health centers to improve and expand the delivery of substance abuse services. H.R. 3680 would encourage and train health care providers to prescribe lifesaving overdose reversal drugs. Enacting this legislation will help reduce drug overdoses across the country by giving atrisk patients better access to lifesaving overdose reversal drugs. The plague of opioid overdose deaths across the nation is disturbing. but there are ways to combat this trend. H.R. 3680 is supported by the American Medical Association. the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the Harm Reduction Coalition. A party. or organization receiving a grant under this legislation will use the grant for the following reasons: 1. To establish a program for coprescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs. 2. To train and provide resources for health care providers and pharmacists on the coprescribing of opioid reversal drugs. 3. To establish mechanisms and processes for tracking patients participating in the program. 4. To purchase opioid overdose reversal drugs for distribution. 5. To offset the copays and other cost sharing associated with opioid overdose reversal drugs to ensure that cost is not a limiting factor for eligible patients. 6. To conduct community outreach. in conduction with community based organizations. designed to raise awareness of coprescribing practices and the availability of opioid overdose reversal drugs. 7. To establish protocols to connect patients who have experienced a drug overdose with appropriate treatment. including medications assisted treatment and appropriate counseling and behavioral therapies. Mr. Speaker. the mounting number of people adversely affected and the over 25.000 lives lost expressly demonstrates the need for this type of legislation. H.R. 3680 is a positive step in the right direction and I urge all members to support this important legislation."
1140090891,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4599 the ""Reducing Unused Medication Act of 2016"". This bill is an important measure that will decrease the number of unused medications available for misuse to the public by setting limitations on the most frequent avenues used to secure unused medication. As we know. many times patients are prescribed medication far beyond their needs. Unused prescription medication creates a lethal danger to households and communities across America. and failing to properly dispose of unfinished medications can have dire consequences on the environment and our ecosystem. According to a new study conducted by Geisinger Health System and published in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association just 11 percent of unused prescription drugs were disposed of via drug takeback programs. while 55 percent were left in the medicine cabinet. 14 percent were thrown in the trash. and 9 percent were flushed down the toilet. As we have heard many unfortunate stories as we bring greater awareness to this issue. we know that abuse of medicine among teenagers is a growing problem. Easy access to parents and grandparents leftover medications is just throwing gasoline on the fire. Meanwhile. more than 60.000 young children are taken to the emergency room each year after ingesting a family members medication. With respect to the environment. the FDA no longer recommends flushing drugs down the toiler because sewage treatment plants lack the capacity to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products residue. H.R. 4599 will amend the Controlled Substances Act to permit certain fillings of prescriptionssuch that a prescription for a controlled substance may be partially filled if: It is not prohibited by state law. The prescription is written and filled in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act. regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. and State law. The partial fill is requested by the patient or the practitioner that wrote the prescription. and The total quantity dispensed in all partial fillings does not exceed the total quantity prescribed. Mr. Speaker. enacting this legislation will work to not only combat a number of prescription drug abuses. but also deal a debilitating blow to the mounting opioid abuse epidemic."
1140093254,"The challenge is. as we learned from 9111. ""operating within their specified scope of authority. preparedness leaders in characteristic bureaucratic fashion often serve to bolster the profile and import of their own organization. thereby creating a silo effect .. ."" So let me speak as that Homeland Security member and the person who has been engaged in the crises or disasters in my own community. When we collaborate we work better together. When we develop relationships. we work better together. Let me just offer a moment of personal privilege as someone speaking about relationships. This bill has many good elements in it. and I am propelled and committed to diversity and respecting all people. I am saddened by the language that the Russell amendment has dealing with the LGBT. and I am saddened that the Dent amendment was not allowed in. We need to build on collaborating with all people to secure America and to make a better military. I thank the gentleman for the support of my amendment in the en bloc. Mr. Chair. I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment Number 4 to H.R. 4909. the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. offered by Chairman THORNBERRY. I want to express my thanks and appreciation to Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH. and their colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their work thank on this bill and their devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces. I also thank Chairman SESSIONS and Ranking Member SLAUGHTER of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64. which is included in En Bloc Amendment Number 4. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 makes an important contribution to the bill by improving the effectiveness of the Northern Command (""NORTHCOM"") in fulfilling its critical mission of protecting the U.S. homeland in event of war and to provide support to local. state. and federal authorities in times of national emergency. Specifically. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 encourages NORTHCOM to: 1. Develop and has in place a leadership strategy that will strengthen and foster necessary institutional and interpersonal relationships with state and local governments. and 2. Develop an instructional program to train key personnel how to lead effectively in the event of a disaster when they do not have command authority to dictate actions. A mission critical function of NORTHCOM. which was established in 2002 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks is to bring the capabilities and the resources of the U.S. military to the assistance of the American people during a catastrophic disaster like war. a pandemic outbreak of diseases such Ebola. Zika. Sars. or influenza. major earthquakes. floods. and natural disasters. or terrorist attacks like those occurring on September 11. 2001 and at the Boston Marathon on April 15. 2013. NORTHCOM leaders will be much more effective in saving lives. protecting assets. and enhancing resilience after the disaster has occurred if they are trained in the techniques of effective engagement with civilian leadership. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 will help ensure that such training will be available. Mr. Chair. let me explain why this type of trainingcommonly referred to as ""Resilience"" training is very important. As stated in a highly influential journal article by Professor Leonard Marcus and his colleagues at Harvards National Public Leadership Initiative. ""effective emergency preparedness and response requires leadership that can accomplish perceptive coordination and communication amongst diverse agencies and sectors."" (Leonard J. Marcus. Barry C. Dorn. and Joseph M. Henderson. MetaLeadership and National Emergency Preparedness: A Model to Build Government Connectivity. in Biosecurity And Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy. Practice. And Science Volume 4. Number 2. 2006). The challenge is. as we learned from the 9/ 11 Commission. operating within their specified scope of authority. preparedness leaders in characteristic bureaucratic fashion often serve to bolster the profile and import of their own organization. thereby creating a silo effect that interferes with effective system wide planning and response. Resilience training seeks to equip preparedness leaders overcome this obstacle of ""traditional silo thinking by teaching ""metaleadership."" a new type of overarching leadership that intentionally connects the purposes and work of different organizations or organizational units. Metaleadership training enables leaders to provide guidance. direction. and momentum across organizational lines that develop into a shared course of action and a commonality of purpose among people and agencies that are doing what may appear to be very different work. Metaleaders have the skill and training to imaginatively and effectively leverage system assets. information. and capacities. which a particularly critical function for organizations with emergency preparedness responsibilities like responding to terrorist attacks. natural disasters. or pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases like the Ebola and the Zika Virus. which may disproportionately affect persons in the Gulf Coast region. including my congressional district in Houston. Texas. As a senior and charter member of the Homeland Security Committee. and the Ranking Member of Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime. Terrorism. Homeland Security. and Investigations. I have spent the better part of the last decade and a half working to craft policies and provide the resources. personnel. equipment. and funding needed to protect the security of our homeland and the American people. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 will help ensure that those responsible for providing leadership in times of national emergency have the skills and training to prevent. mitigate. or recover from any major catastrophe. disaster. or tragedy that could befall our nation. I urge my colleagues to support En Bloc Amendment Number 64 and thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for including Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 in this important measure."

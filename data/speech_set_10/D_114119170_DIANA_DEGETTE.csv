1140004025,Thank you very much. Madam Speaker. I am going to state this as simply as I can. There is no public funding for abortion. Whether you like it or not. the Hyde amendment. which has been the law of this land for decades now. says there is no public funding for abortion. That has not changed. There is no public funding for abortion under the Affordable Care Act or any other government program. This bill would vastly expand the current restrictions on a womans right to get her own health care through her insurance. with her own private money. that she. her family. and her doctor think she needs. Let me say how this would work. Under H.R. 7. people who buy their insurance in exchangesand their employersnow would not be able to spend their own private dollars to buy insurance that they need for themselves and their families. This not only would be a radical expansion over current law. it would be a terrible wedge between patients and their doctors. I do not care how many polls there are that you might cite. because the vast majority of Americans think that a womans private health care decisions should be made between herself. her family. and her doctorcertainly. not by politicians in Washington. D.C. H.R. 7 is an idea that has been proposed time and again. It is not going anywhere. I am sure it will probably pass this House today. and it will go over to the other body. and it will die. If not. the President will veto it. Here are my questions to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Why arent we spending this week talking about how the women of America can get better paychecks? Why arent we spending our time talking this week about how the women and men of America can get tax credits so that the children they do have can go to child care that is quality child care? Why arent we spending our time this week talking about how women and men should be able to get paid the same amount for doing the very same job? That is what I think this Congress should be spending its time doing. not passing these bills which are false statements about a womans private decisions about her health care. I urge the body to defeat this bill.
1140004190,"Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I just have to end with what I started with. There is no Federal taxpayer funding for abortion. There has not been for many decades. Some people. like me. think that this is an illconceived public policy. but it is the law of the land. it is the law of the land every year in the appropriations bill. and it is part of the compromise that was negotiated with the Affordable Care Act. so we need to keep that in mind as we talk about what this legislation does. What this legislation will do is it will take away the ability of women in the exchanges to buy comprehensive health care insurance with their own money. Now. I heard many speakers on the other side of the aisle today talk about their deep concerns about abortion and unwanted pregnancies. Well. I will tell you something: if you want to reduce unwanted pregnancieswhich all of us in this room dowhat you need to do is give women quality health insurance with robust family planning and a full range of health care services. The Guttmacher Institute. in a 2010 study. showed. happily. that teen pregnancy in this country was at the lowest rate in over 30 years. Do you know why? Two reasons: number one. birth control for these teenagers. and. number two. comprehensive health insurance. This Congress which has passed. over and over again. restrictions on birth control accessnot just for teens. but for all womenand restrictions on comprehensive family planning is actually passing legislation that is going to stop this decrease in unwanted teen pregnancies. It is an illconceived policy. It is a wrongheaded policy. If we want to stop unwanted pregnancies. the way to do it is to have comprehensive health insurance for all American women. Now. the majority. at the last minute. pulled the bill with the egregious provisions on rape that would have required rape victims to affirmatively go to the police before they could raise the exception. but dont make any mistake about it. this bill is just as egregious as that bill. The reason it is is because. in an unprecedented move. it stops American women and their families from being able to get comprehensive health insurance with their own money. What would happen is it would open up a significant divide between the coverage that large employers would give to families and small employers and individuals. Now. the other thing this does is it reopens the debate and the compromise that we had in the Affordable Care Act. The compromise we made in that bill was that there would be no public funding for abortion under the Affordable Care Act. It was negotiated. it was agreed upon. and as the other side admitted. the President issued an executive order saying he would enforce the current law on that. and. in fact. that is what happened. The act required two separate premium payments for women and their families who receive premium tax credits and choose coverage that includes abortion services. The act is clear in its language. No portion of premium tax credits may be used to pay for the portion of comprehensive health coverage that is purchased in the marketplaces that relates to abortion services. The compromise was agreed upon by prolife groups like the Catholic Health Association and everybody else. and now. this compromise is being thrown out the window. Well. our opponents say there was a GAO report last September that said that insurance companies were not segregating the funds. so they say that that means. somehow. Federal dollars are being used to pay for abortions. Well. after that GAO study came out. Madam Speaker. the HHS promulgated a new rule clarifying the agreement under the Affordable Care Act that the funds had to be segregated. and they promulgated this rule on Wednesday. Madam Speaker. I will insert that proposed rule into the RECORD at the end of my remarks. So this compromise is being honored by the administration. Now. early in this debate. I asked my opponents to please give me one example where Federal taxpayer dollars have been used to pay for abortions. I havent heard that example. and it is because it is not happening. This is a false issue that is being raised. I would submit to everybody here: lets stop talking about this false issue just because there are a whole bunch of people in town who want us to pass some legislation. lets talk about some real issues. We just received a Statement of Administration Policy from the White House. Not surprisingly. the administration has said that the President would veto this bill. The bill is likely dead on arrival in the Senate. but even if it did pass. it would be vetoed. I have a suggestion for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: lets take up some issues that the women and families of America care about. lets take up the issue of how we are going to give women good jobs with comprehensive health insurance. so they can make their own decisions. along with their family and their doctor. Lets talk about legislation that will allow women of America to get jobs that have equal pay for equal work to the men. Lets talk about a bill that will give tax credits for families who have to struggle every month to pay for child care for their little kids. Lets talk about that. And finally. lets talk about parental leave. which virtually every other country in the world has. so that when families have children whom they love so much and want to take care of. they wont have to go back to work because their employer doesnt pay them for family leave. Lets talk about that because. Madam Speaker. that is what the women and families of America want us to talk about. I urge us to reject this legislation. I urge a ""no"" vote. g. Segregation of Funds for Abortion Services (� 156.280) Section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act and �156.280 specify accounting and other standards for issuers of QHPs through the Exchange in the individual market that cover abortion services for which public funding is prohibited (also referred to as nonexcepted abortion services). The statute and regulations establish that unless otherwise prohibited by State law. a QHP issuer may elect to cover such services. If an issuer elects to cover such services under a QHP sold through the individual market Exchange. the issuer must take certain steps to ensure that no premium tax credit or costsharing reduction funds are used to pay claims for abortion services for which public funding may not be used. We are providing guidance on an individual market Exchange issuers responsibilities with respect to requirements related to QHP coverage of abortion services for which public funding is prohibited. HHS works with stakeholders. including States and issuers. to help them fully understand and follow the statutes and regulations governing the provision of health insurance coverage under a QHP through the Exchange. As is the case with many provisions in the Affordable Care Act. States and State insurance commissioners are the entities primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing the provisions in section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act related to individual market QHP coverage of nonexcepted abortion services. OPM may issue guidance related to these provisions for multiState plan issuers. Under section 1303(b)(2)(B) of the Affordable Care Act. as implemented in �156.280(e)(2)(i). individual market Exchange issuers must collect a separate payment from each enrollee. for an amount equal to the AV of the coverage for abortions for which public funding is prohibited. However. section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act and � 156.280 do not specify the method an issuer must use to comply with the separate payment requirement. This provision may be satisfied in a number of ways. Several such ways include. but are not limited to: sending the enrollee a single monthly invoice or bill that separately itemizes the premium amount for nonexcepted abortion services. sending a separate monthly bill for these services. or sending the enrollee a notice at or soon after the time of enrollment that the monthly invoice or bill will include a separate charge for such services and specify the charge. Section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act permits. but does not require a QHP issuer to separately identify the premium for nonexcepted abortion services on the monthly premium bill in order to comply with the separate payment requirement. A consumer may pay the premium for nonexcepted abortion services and for all other services in a single transaction. with the issuer depositing the funds into the issuers separate allocation accounts as required by section 1301(b)(2)(C) of the Affordable Care Act. as implemented in �156.280(e)(2)(ii) and � 156.280(e)(3). Section 1303(b)(2)(D) of the Affordable Care Act. as implemented in �156.280(e)(4). establishes requirements for individual market Exchange issuers with respect to how much they must charge each QHP enrollee for coverage of abortions for which public funding is prohibited. A QHP issuer must estimate the basic per enrollee. per month cost. determined on an average actuarial basis. for including coverage of nonexcepted abortion services. In making this estimate. a QHP issuer may not estimate the basic cost of coverage for nonexcepted abortion services to be less than one dollar per enrollee. per month. This means that an issuer must charge each QHP enrollee a minimum premium of one dollar per month for coverage of nonexcepted abortion services."
1140025024,"Madam Speaker. in 6 days. the highway trust fund expires. So what is Congress spending its time doing today? Of course. it is debating a bill that will limit a womans access to a safe and legal medical procedure and that will place politicians in a place they should never bebetween a woman and her doctor. Ask your mother. your sister. your daughter. your wife. or your neighbor. and she will tell you that women dont need politicians interference when making their own healthcare decisions. Yet here we are again today. debating a bill that does just that. Everybody remembers that this bill was pulled from the floor in January because it was so extreme. but. today. the bill that is on the floor is even worse than the bill that they pulled in January. H.R. 36 is particularly harmful to victims of rape and incest. Women who have had unbelievable trauma would be effectively forced to get permission before they could seek the medical treatment that they needed to regain some control over their bodies. their health. and their safety. They would have to jump through complex and punitive legal hoops before they could have the procedures that they need. Therefore. somebody who has been victimized once would end up being victimized again by our government. Lets be clear. The new provisions in this law include a number of burdensome requirements on rape and incest victims: First. there is a waiting period of 48 hours for an adult rape survivor. Second. there is a requirement that a minor who is a victim of rape or incest would give written proof after 20 weeks that she reported the crime to law enforcement or to a government agency. A minor who is a victim of incest has to do this. There is language that specifies that the counseling or medical treatment described above may not be from a health center that provides abortion services. So lets say she goes to her doctor. and she gets counseling. but someone else in that medical practice provides abortion. She is out of luck. If she doesnt thread that needle. too bad. She cant get it. Perhaps the most outrageous thing about this bill. though. is the fundamental disrespect that it shows to women. It assumes that women will just wake up in this country after 20 weeks of pregnancy. decide to have abortions. and then lie about being victims of rape or incest. That view is just wrong. and it is offensive to women. By the way. as Ms. SLAUGHTER mentioned. this bill is patently unconstitutional. and even if it didnt get vetoed by the President. it would be struck down by the Supreme Court. I suggest that we vote ""no"" now and that we respect womens ability to make their own health decisions."
1140051118,"Madam Speaker. Planned Parenthood provides basic health services to millions of Americans: Pap smears. breast cancer screenings. family planning. and birth control. In fact. there were over 4 million visits to Planned Parenthood clinics last year. and over 90 percent of this was basic womens health care and not abortions. So why are we talking about this today? Why are we talking about this legislation? Planned Parenthood does these services and no Federal funds are spent on abortion services that Planned Parenthood does provide. but yet the majority will take the radical step of denying women the basic health care they need. This radical agenda is wrong. It is wrong for American women. and it is wrong for us when the Federal budget expires in just 13 days. Madam Speaker. I. too. have reviewed the videotapes. Our committee reviewed the videotapes. and. as Ms. CASTOR saidand it bears repeatingno wrongdoing was shown. There are no criminal charges. There are no charges at all that are pending whatsoever against Planned Parenthood. Madam Speaker. yesterday in the Energy and Commerce Committee. my Republican colleagues in their radical effort went so far as to show a photo of a stillborn baby. implying that that baby was a fetus being used for fetal tissue development. What is worse. that photo was shown without the womans consent. It had no relation to Planned Parenthood. It was used without the mothers consent. What I want to know from the majority: Is this the evidence that you are using to decide that you are going to deny funding for Planned Parenthood and all the wellwomen visits women use? Madam Speaker. my colleagues ought to be ashamed of showing this. and my colleagues ought to be ashamed of putting this bill on the floor today. We are seeing shamelessness right here on the floor today. My colleagues on the other side are trying to do everything they can to insert themselves between American women and their right to make their own healthcare decisions. It is wrong. and I urge a ""no"" vote on this legislation."
1140052895,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. the new fiscal year starts in less than 36 hours. and Congress has still not passed the annual appropriations bills. If we dont do it. the government will shut down. During the last shutdown. we lost $24 billion and 120.000 private sector jobs. I am sure we could expect just the same now. The debt ceiling will need to be raised within the next couple months. Madam Speaker. and many Republicans are already threatening to refuse to perform even that basic task. This would throw the international economy into chaos. It would cause the loss of tens of thousands more jobs in the United States. Of course. the ExIm Bank expired in June. and our business communities are clamoring for reauthorization. Why? Well. last year the ExIm Bank financed deals that supported 164.000 American jobs. I would suggest. Madam Speaker. that the U.S. House should spend this week figuring out how to avoid a political and financial catastrophe rather than once again passing a blatantly political bill stripping women of their basic healthcare rights. This latest attack targets both the women who need to see a doctor or healthcare provider as well as the providers themselves. I wonder if the people on the other side of the aisle actually read this bill on the floor today because it is so broadly written that it would target any medical providerdoctor. hospital. clinic. you name itthat has even the most tenuous connection to the provision of a full range of womens healthcare services. The majority claims that this bill targets Planned Parenthood. a healthcare provider that 2.7 million Americans rely on every year. First of all. over 90 percent of the services provided by that agency are routine wellness exams. like breast exams. cervical cancer screening. and birth control and family planning services. As we all know. because we discussed it ad nauseam last week. Planned Parenthood has received no Federal funding for abortions. In fact. no agency receives Federal funding for abortions with a very few exceptions. This bill would. therefore. not stop any government funding of abortions. It would instead allow Federal and State funding to be cut off for any entity. not just Planned Parenthood. which performs abortions with private dollars. That means that poor women would be blocked from the full range of healthcare services that they need not just at Planned Parenthood. but at their local hospital or their local clinic or the offices of another womens health group. Lets call this bill what it is. It is an attempt to eliminate healthcare services for women across the board. using the Planned Parenthood witch hunt as an excuse. Lets be very clear. The investigation of the last few months has demonstrated that the videotapes the majority so heavily relies on are heavily edited. manipulated. and at times downright misleading. We are the U.S. Congress. Madam Speaker. and we are better than that. The American public will not stand for this diversion. and neither should we. Lets defeat this illconceived bill. Lets direct all of our collective attention to bipartisan solutions resolving the looming fiscal disaster that we are all facing. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140095330,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. We have been talking a lot about the. admittedly. very arcane details of this bill. I want to talk for a minutes about how this bill is going to impact the families of America. Think about someone you know and love who will probably start a family in the next decade. I think of my own two daughters who are in their 20s. That future parent will be very excited about the arrival of a child. The parents will create a nursery in their home for their new baby. a space that is clean. warm. and safe. Well. they think it is safe. But right now. under current law. that rocking chair in the corner could be covered with toxic flame retardants. The fresh paint on the walls could contain harmful volatile organic compounds. The rug beneath the crib probably has been treated with formaldehyde. which is a carcinogen. Parents and children should not have to worry whether the most basic. everyday things they do are toxic to their health. TSCA has been a flawed piece of legislation since it passed in 1976. Nobody liked itthe environmental community. the chemical industry. or the parents of America. We need to bring some certainty to the regulation of the tens of thousands of chemicals that we have out there. and that is what this bill will do. Did you know that under this bill. for the first time. EPA will have access to the information it needs on a chemical? For the first time. EPA will regulate the worst chemicals out there. like arsenic? For the first time. the EPA will have deadlines for review so that Americans are protected from dangerous chemicals as soon as practicable? And for the first time. Americans will know exactly what is out there in commerce? For the first time. every nursery in America will be clean. warm. and safe. That is what America deserves. Is this bill perfect? No. But it is what we are expected to do as Members of the House and Senate. Democrats and Republicansprotect the safety of our children and generations to come. I really want to thank my colleagues. I want to thank Mr. PALLONE and Mr. TONKO on our side of the aisle. I want to thank the rock star. Mr. SHIMKUS. who I have been working with. along with Mr. GREEN. since 2007 to bring this to reality. This truly is a great day for the families of America. and I am really proud that we are able to get this done. I hope my colleagues will look at the bill in totality. I hope you will see how. finally. we are going to be able to actually regulate these chemicals. and I hope you will vote ""yes."""
1140104733,"Mr. Speaker. Columbine is in my district. and I was in Congress when the terrible shooting in Columbine happened. Who will forget that day. all those students marching out of the school with their hands held up so they could show the police that they werent those terrible shooters. Who can forget the terrible tragedy reflected in the mothers faces when they saw that their children werent those children that were bused to safety? Who can forget the lingering aspects that Columbine has shown us. year after year. tragedy after tragedy? I cant tell you the number of times I have repeated that horror in my own life. watching on TV when the Aurora shooting. just a few miles from my house. occurred. A masked man came in and. with an assault rifle and highcapacity magazine clips. shot so many people in just a few minutes. Just a few weeks ago. when we saw. in Florida. one lone gunman with an assault rifle and highcapacity magazines just mowing down so many people who were having fun. who can forget the reflection in those mothers faces? But for every terrible tragedy that we have like that. we have thousands of more people who are killed on our streets. in our urban areas. and around our country. and who are killed in terrible domestic violence cases. Just last week. when I was at home in Denver. just a few blocks from my husbands law office. a man walked into an office and shot a woman. and then turned the gun on himself. I cant tell you how I felt that day. when my husband sent me an email. seemingly out of the blue. that said: ""Dont worry. Im on lockdown. Im okay."" This has become just routine in Americans lives. and it is wrong. It is wrong. We cant continue like this as a country. We cant continue to have a moment of silence every time there is a mass murder. and to tuttut every time we hear of someone like that woman who was shot in my district. and then do nothing. This is why we had our sitin before the July Fourth recess. And I will tell you what. those actions woke up my constituents. My office here in Washington. D.C.. and my office in Denver. Colorado. were inundated with phone calls from people saying: ""What can we do? We so desperately want something to happen."" This is what I said then. and this is what I say now: We cannot stop until we pass commonsense gun safety legislation. What does this mean? Well. for starters. you would think Congress. both sides of the aisle. both sides of the Capitol. could say. if you are on a terrorist watch list. you should not be able to buy a gun. Surely we can stipulate to that. You would think that we would agree with the vast majority of American people. Democrats and Republicans. people all around the country. that people should have thorough and sufficient background checks before they can obtain a weapon. You would surely think that we would allow the Federal Government to conduct research on gun safety so that we would know. as a matter of public health. what we need to do to keep our children safe in their schools. our children safe on their street corners. and in their school yards. You would think. beyond that. that we could have a rational discussion. not marred by the very powerful gun lobbyists. saying: What can we do to make sure that somebody. for whatever reason they might have. doesnt get an assault weapon and walk into a theater and kill scores of people with a highcapacity magazine in just a few minutes? You would think we could do that. and I am hoping that we will do that. I am hoping that the tide has turned. Today. we will take up mental health legislation that was developed in my committee. the Energy and Commerce Committee. It is a bipartisan bill. I worked hard with Chairman MURPHY and Chairman UPTON on this bill. and also with the Democrats on our side of the aisle. Congressman PALLONE and Congressman GREEN and others. It is a good bill. but it is just a first step. We need to do a lot more with mental health in this country and. beyond that. we need to do a lot more on gun safety. Nobody should assume that this bill we are voting on today is a substitute for a rational. thorough. bipartisan conversation on gun safety. I look forward to taking the terrible tragedies that we have seen the 20 years I have been in Congress and to dedicating commonsense gun safety legislation to all those lives that were lost."
1140108728,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to this bill. which is really nothing more than a wolf in sheeps clothing. It is being touted as just simply a conscience clause. but. in fact. it strips away patient protections. it gives employers and healthcare companies the right to override a womans reproductive healthcare decision. it vastly expands already damaging existing laws that restrict womens abilities to get full insurance coverage. and. just to add. it would clog the courts because it would create private rights of action for healthcare entities to enforce the law. Now. existing socalled conscience provisions are bad enough. but what they apply to is existing healthcare entities. What this bill would do is something that has never been done before. It would allow employers and others to exercise this right. it would require OCR and DOJ to investigate claims of discrimination. and it would expand the definition of healthcare entities. All of this would just simply interfere with a womans ability to get accurate information about treatment options and could lead to her being deprived of timely emergency care. There is already plenty of evidence that current conscience provisions jeopardize womens health and safety. They create confusion about whether healthcare providers are required to offer critical care in emergency situations. I have heard some heartwrenching stories about what happened to the women. Let me just tell you one of them. Tamesha Means of Muskegon. Michigan. was only 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke. The nearest hospital. Mercy Health Partners. didnt pursue the normal course of treatment. inducing labor for a pregnancy that wasnt viable. in order to avoid risky complications. Instead. what they did is they gave her painkillers and they sent her home. Over the next 2 days. Tamesha returned to the hospital twice. bleeding and in severe pain. running a high fever. only to get more or less the same response. They were completing the papers to send her home a third timea third timewhen she started to deliver a very premature infant. dead within hours. Madam Speaker. we would likely see much more needless suffering and endangerment if the bill before us were to pass. It would let employers who sponsor health plans deny their female employees access to medical services to which the employer objects. It would reinforce existing provisions that let health providers opt out of providing such services or even informing people about them. With all of this in mind. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bad legislation. Every patient should be able to make meaningful. informed decisions about their health care. Congress needs to stop interfering in womens health decisions once and for all. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140108788,"Now. lets talk about the nine Nassau County nurses apparently required by their employer to provide these services. All of those nurses were reinstated to their job after they made a complaint. According to any example that we have gotten. these people have had recourse under current law. So what does this bill do? This bill doesnt give anybody any more conscientious ability to object. What this bill does is it allows whole new classes of people to refuse to provide services to the women of America. It allows employers. it allows healthcare plans and health plan sponsors to refuse to provide women the services they need. The only people who are going to be hurt by this are the patients. And I will tell you what. if you want to talk about civil rights. talk about the civil rights of those patients. Talk about Mindy Swank. who is a woman from Illinois. She was denied care by a Catholic hospital when her water broke just 20 weeks into her pregnancy. Even though her life would have been endangered by continuing the pregnancy and it could have threatened her ability to have more children in the future. the hospital she visited not only refused to treat her. but it refused to provide documentation that her abortion was medically necessary so somebody else could treat her. She was forced to wait weeks. returning to the hospital four times with bleeding. until finally she was deemed sick enough to induce labor and give birth to a baby who died without ever regaining consciousness. Talk about her civil rights. That is what we are thinking about today. So I have got to sayI am a deeply religious person myselfI believe that we should give people their rights to their religious expression. and we do that under current law. I dont think that taking womens rights to health care away does anything to help with that situation. Here is one more thing. In case you didnt know. President Obama issued an order today saying that he is going to veto this bill if. in the unlikely event. it ever passes his desk. So what are we doing here today? The majority has announced that they are going out of session for 7 weeks at the end of this week. They are not going to deal with the Zika funding. They are not going to deal with gun safety legislation. which would save many Americans lives. They are not going to finish the appropriations bills. on and on and on. We have spent a whole hour of our valuable time today debating about something that is not only unnecessary from a conscience point of view. but that could endanger womens lives. and we are doing nothing to help the lives of the millions and millions of Americans that need it. It is not the right focus. It is not the right time. It is not the right legislation. I urge every single one of my colleagues to examine their conscience and to vote ""no"" on this poorly thoughtout piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time."

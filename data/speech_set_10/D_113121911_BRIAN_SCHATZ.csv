1130031822,Mr. President. I am here today to briefly discuss an amendment to an important provision in the immigration bill that the Senate is considering concerning Stateless persons. Section 3405 of the comprehensive immigration bill would. for the first time. recognize and provide protections to those people in the United States that have no nationalitythey are Stateless. There are countless men. women. and children in the United States today who cannot claim any nation as their home. Many lost their nationality when their country of origin ceased to exist as a result of political upheaval. rampant persecution. or violent conflict. The comprehensive immigration bill would encourage these people in the United States to come forward and apply to be recognized as Stateless persons. Under the proposed law. if an individual is recognized as Stateless. they could seek conditional lawful status. provided they meet the appropriate requirements. and be protected from being deported back to a State they no longer recognize as their home. The amendment I am offering to the immigration bill would advance this important effort to recognize and protect Stateless persons living in the United States. We live in a time when political turmoil. persecution. and war are no longer the only conditions creating Stateless persons. Today. rapid and extreme environmental change threatens to erode national boundaries and make States uninhabitable to people. This is not an abstract challenge. Lowlying island States and atolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans today face an existential crisis due to inexorable sea level rise that is making them uninhabitable. In Kiribati. for example. rising seas are contaminating local water tables with salt water. denuding fertile land and decimating island crops. The threat of higher seas also makes Kiribati. the Marshall Islands. and other island States more vulnerable to extreme weather that will inundate these countries with swells of storm surge and leave whole communities literally underwater. And in a short time. these island States will disappear beneath the waves. Sea level rise is just one of the dramatic challenges the world faces as a result of climate change. Other environmental stressors are manifesting in States around the world that carry similar consequences as well. In North Africa. for instance. countries such as Morocco. Tunisia. and Libya lose hundreds of square miles of fertile land each year to desertification. driving away farming communities that are accustomed to living off the land. In Southeast Asia. salt water intrusion from sea level rise is destroying aquaculture ponds that communities rely on for economic development and food. uprooting families from their homes and driving them inland in search of new ways to support their livelihoods. And rapidly receding glaciers in the Himalayan Plateau threaten to make the headwaters of the regions major rivers run dry. with consequences for downstream communities that may eventually be forced from their homes in search of new water sources. Scientists expect that climate change will exacerbate these environmental stressors. including drought. glacial melt. and heat waves. transforming once fertile landscape into barren and uninhabitable land. Besides these slow onset challenges. there are more people at risk today of being made permanently homeless by extreme weather events like typhoons. hurricanes. and other storms that threaten to decimate communities. And. unfortunately. the populations most at risk also happen to be the worlds poorest people who too often have no other choice but to abandon their homes once disaster strikes. By the end of the century. climate change will eclipse war as the greatest driver of homelessness around the world. We can and must protect those people who are in the United States from being deported to a country that is no longer inhabitable due to sea level rise or other environmental changes that leave the state uninhabitable to people. The amendment I am proposing is quite simple. If enacted. the Secretary of Homeland Security. in consultation with the Secretary of State. may designate individuals or a group of individuals displaced permanently by climate change as Stateless persons. Again. let me be clear about what this amendment does. It simply recognizes that climate change. like war. is one of the most significant contributors to homelessness in the world. And like with States torn apart and made uninhabitable by war. we have an obligation not to deport people back to a country made uninhabitable by sea level rise and other extreme environmental changes that render these states desolate. It does not grant any individual or group of individuals outside the United States with any new status or avenue for seeking asylum in the United States. Finally. the amendment also recognizes that the climate challenges that other States face are not unique to people beyond U.S. borders. Indeed. Hawaii. Alaska and other States are and will continue to experience increased environmental pressures. with sea level rise. drought. wild fires and extreme weather driving Americans from their homes. As such. the amendment would require the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study assessing the impact of climate change on internal migration in the United States and U.S. territories. The GAO report will assess the impacts and costs on existing Federal. State. and local services of various regions resulting from climate changeinduced migration of U.S. citizens. This important study will help the United States chart a path forward for responding to internal persons displaced by environmental change and extreme weather events. and identify what resources the Federal. State. and local governments need to invest in to adequately respond to climateinduced migration. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges the United States will confront this century. But with the kinds of forwardthinking and pragmatic policies I am proposing today. we can put the United States on a path to respond to the challenges the country will face. and help protect those communities most at risk. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this important effort.
1130041269,Commonsense solutions to the threat of climate change are everywhere. We have been talking a lot about the risks of climate change. but lets talk a little bit about the opportunitiesthe opportunities to fight climate change. to transform how we produce and consume energy. and to grow a clean energy economy. We know what we need to do. We also know how to do it. Congress may not enact comprehensive climate legislation this year. but it can still take action to make a difference. As I see it. we have an opportunity for common ground in three areas: energy efficiency. tax incentives. and innovative financing structures to promote clean energy deployment. Perhaps the greatest opportunity for compromise is in energy efficiency. the commonsense idea that we ought to save money and reduce pollution at the same time by simply consuming less energy to perform the same tasks. Senators SHAHEEN and PORTMAN have taken this up and are writing excellent legislation to improve and enhance energy efficiency across the Nation. Their bill includes sensible measures that will help to achieve significant reduction in energy use. Buildings use close to 40 percent of the energy used in the United States. This bill will contain provisions that will update the building codes. increase efficiency goals for Federal facilities. and provide incentives to industrial facilities. commercial buildings. and homes. In recent weeks. we have been hearing that ShaheenPortman may come to the floor. We are encouraged by that. We encourage both the majority leader and the minority leader. as well as the managers of this legislation. to move it to the floor expeditiously so that we can take care of it before the August break. Second. I urge my colleagues to support tax incentives for clean energy. many of which expire at the end of this year. Senators on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly worked together to extend these incentives. especially the wind credit. We can build on this common ground to support sensible solutions. We not only have the opportunity to extend clean energy incentives as a part of tax reform but to improve upon them. We should focus on creating credits that reward performance and innovation and do not pick winners and losers. They should help industries scale up. bring costs down. and become competitive on their own. Finally. the Federal Government must do more to help new and innovative technologies reach the marketplace. New technologies face significant barriers to market entry. barriers that focused government intervention such as loan guarantees and other financing mechanisms can help overcome. The Senator from Rhode Island may also have thoughts on other commonsense solutions. I yield to him for any comments he may have.
1130046998,"Mr. President. I rise to speak on the Affordable Care Act. At home in Hawaii we have a saying. ""Lucky you live Hawaii."" That can mean a lot of different things to different people. but when talking about access to affordable. effective care. this phrase has particular meaning. In the early 1970s. the rate of uninsured in our State was about 30 percent. meaning roughly 1 in 3 in our population would live in fear that sickness or injury could cause financial ruin for themselves or their families. The people of Hawaii knew this was unacceptable. In 1974. the State government passed an innovative piece of legislation. the Prepaid Health Care Act. Now simply known as Prepaid. this legislation requires employers to provide affordable and quality care for hundreds of thousands of individuals and their families. Our uninsured rate is one of the lowest in the country. with only 8 percent of our population lacking any type of insurance. Even though Hawaii has been at the forefront in making health care a right and not a privilege. we still have a way to go. Even with Prepaid. there are more than 100.000 people in our State still uninsured. When the Affordable Care Act passed 3 years ago. I knew it meant that those who are uninsured or underinsured in Hawaii would find some relief. We have already seen major successes since this landmark legislation passed. Yet people are still afraid of ObamaCare. This is because a lot of people have spent a lot of time and money to make the American public believe that somehow this legislation is bad for them and will harm them. That is why. when asked about health care reform as a whole. many Americans say they are concerned. they have anxiety. But when you talk to people back in Hawaii and across the Nation. and even those who think they dont like health care reform. they like what it does. For example. parents like that they can keep their children on their health insurance until the age of 26. which affects 6.000 young adults in the State of Hawaii. People will no longer have to live in fear of lifetime limits on health benefits. which will help more than 460.000 residents of Hawaii. including 115.000 children. More than half a million people in my State will no longer have to worry about being denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. As a State that has committed to Medicaid expansion. Hawaii will also now be able to provide care to close to more than 68.000 residents starting in People like these policies. People like what health care reform is already doing for them. While my colleagues across the aisle are looking to repeal this historic legislation. I am looking forward to how we can build on its success. Let me be clear. The fact that health care reform is working is exactly why the detractors of the ACA are trying so hard to stop it from being fully implemented. They know the American people are embracing ObamaCare because of all the good it will do for our families. In particular. I am looking forward to the opening of our marketplace. the Hawaii Health Connector. on October 1. Many of the people I have spoken to want to know what the marketplace may mean for them. Simply. the Hawaii Health Connector is going to provide a consumerfriendly way for residents of my State to view and compare a wide variety of plans. Then they will be able to pick the coverage that best suits them and their families. My office has been in constant contact with the Connector. and their staff in Hawaii has been working tirelessly to set up the online and phone interface. and to provide assistance and navigation in the form of kokua. a word in Hawaiian that essentially means pitching in to help your neighbors and your community with no regard for personal gain. This is reflective of the values we have in Hawaii. that everyone deserves to be healthy and have access to affordable and quality care. That doesnt mean we still dont have a lot of work to do. I am hoping a number of bills I have introduced. including the Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act and the Strengthening Health Disparities Data Collection Act. will be considered and voted on by the full Senate in order to solve some of our worst issues in providing care to rural and underserved populations in Hawaii and across the Nation. I believe ACA is working the way it should be. It is increasing the number of insured Americans. promoting preventive care that will help to reduce the human and financial costs of avoidable illness and lowering the costs of care for everyone. Many of my colleagues in Congress choose not to see any of this. The only option for them is total repeal. with zero tolerance for open discussion or compromise on this landmark legislation. but that kind of thinking is what causes the gridlock Americans are so tired of. I understand there will be parts of this law. which is a sweeping piece of legislation. that will need to be amended over time to resolve any kinks. These kinds of revisions have been done with every other landmark domestic social policy that has been passed in this country. including Medicare and Social Security. I am willing. as are my colleagues on the Democratic side. to come to the table and work with Republicans to make necessary improvements over time. but I refuse to engage in the process of political and parliamentary gymnastics designed to score small. shortterm wins at the expense of the American people and the economy. It must be pointed out that anyone who wants to grind the entire government to a halt over the implementation of this severalyearsold law will cause harm to the economy and harm to their communities. because Federal funding provides essential services and programs to constituents in every State and every county in every district. If improvements or changes need to be made. they can be done through the regular order with hearings. serious discussions. and bipartisan support. Ultimately. what we are seeing in Hawaii and across the Nation is President Obamas historic health care package is making inroads in improving our health care system. Efforts to stop that cannot be tolerated by Members of Congress and the people of this Nation. I will continue to support its full implementation and look forward to working with all of my colleagues in the Senate to build upon its success. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1130056062,Madam President. yesterday Senate Republicans rejected a cloture motion on a strictly partyline basis for a simple measure to prevent default for the United States of America. This bears repeating. Yesterday we voted on whether to proceed to a bill to prevent default. and not one Senate Republican voted for it. I think it is fair to say that many of the Senate Republicans are operating in good faith and have a strong desire to get out of this mess. but they are concerned about embarrassing and undermining the Speaker of the House by moving too quickly on this measure. Too quickly came and went a couple of months ago. Worrying about undermining the Speaker of the House should not be our primary concern given the crisis upon us. We should be singularly focused on protecting the dollars as the reserve currency. maintaining our ability to borrow at the lowest possible rate. and retaining our ability to solve problems as the greatest Nation in the world. The time for worrying about the implications for one or the other political party or a faction within it has long since passed. It is time to reopen the government. to pay our bills. to ensure the full faith and credit of the United States. and to return to the negotiating table on all of the challenges in front of us. In short. it is time to get back to governing in the way we should. I would like to emphasize a point that is not made often enough about the current crisis. that is. there is simply nothing conservative about the behavior of the House Republicans. Conservatives traditionally have been characterized by holding a respect for institutions. a focus on the needs of the private sector. and a desire to not waste money. Are these principles being upheld or subverted by the actions of House Republicans? First. with respect to our Democratic institutions. the procedural violence being done to the Congress is hard to overstate in this case. The idea that a faction of a party is demanding concessions in exchange for ceasing their infliction of pain on America is unbelievable. Why? Because we are all Americans here. We all want to do right by our country. So the idea that one party is willing to inflict terrible pain on our country. or else. was so beyond the pale that there is no rule against it because no one ever contemplated that a major political party would ever behave in such a way. The assumption has always been that elected leaders would find a better way to stand for strongly held beliefs than by threatening to bring the American economy to its knees. Up until now that has been a safe assumption. This is the least conservative behavior imaginable because it throws us into a permanent crisis. unable to solve major problems for the foreseeable future. Second. conservatives traditionally have wanted to protect the free marketplace. Some default deniers surmise that maybe the U.S. Government can service its debt while delaying other payments. that we can simply prioritize. The United States of America cannot do that. Even if it were operationally possible. which the Treasury Department assures us it is not. it would cause such severe harm to markets and undermine our credibility so terribly that even talking like that may be doing damage to our economy. In 2011. Congresss delay in raising the debt limit forced the Department of the Treasury to take extraordinary measures to ensure that our government could pay its bills. GAO estimates that this raised Treasurys borrowing costs by about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011. That is $1.3 billion in added government costs just for coming close to defaulting. This does not include the lingering added costs of borrowing that continued beyond fiscal year 2011. It also does not include the wasted time and resources that these extraordinary actions meant. After all. this manufactured crisis took the Treasury Departments focus away from other important cash and debt management responsibilities. The Bipartisan Policy Center projects that the full cost of that crisis to the Federal Government alone. not to the economy. just to the Federal Government. will be around $19 billion over the maturity of the debt. There is nothing conservatively virtuous about defaulting on what we owe. It will cripple free markets. It is Russian roulette played with a bullet in every chamber. There so nothing conservative about that. Finally. there is the conservative principle about saving taxpayers dollars. Two points: First. with the likely passage of the House bill to provide retroactive pay to Federal employees. let me tell you what is happening. We are paying Federal employees to stay home. We are paying our dedicated Federal workers. who want to do their jobs. not to do their jobs. This is not conservative. This is not liberal. for that matter. It is upside down. We are preventing Federal employees from doing their important work. such as assisting small businesses and combating terrorism. Let me be clear. Federal workers did not cause this shutdown and should not lose pay because of it. That is why I cosponsored Senator CARDINs bill to make sure they receive back pay when the government reopens. Our Nations furloughed public servants want to work. and many Federal civilian employees are being required to work during this shutdown without pay. While it does not make sense to punish Federal workers for Congresss dysfunction. it makes way more sense to simply reopen the Federal Government. Still. the House refuses to vote on a clean continuing resolution that can reopen the government tomorrow but instead voted to give backpay after the shutdown ends. What is conservative about paying people to stay home? Second. this shutdown is costing us money. not saving us money. In just the first week. it cost the economy $1.6 billion in lost economic output and is estimated to cost an average of $160 million each additional day. This is hurting small businesses and working families across the country. and it is completely avoidable. As the Presiding Officer knows. people are in real pain. This needs to stop. There is nothing good in this shutdown or in the threat of default. As a progressive. I have talked on this floor about how it hurts our economy. the American people. and the priorities I am fighting for. But you do not have to share my priorities to think this is an awful mess. You can be a rockribbed conservative too. This is bad for all of us. There is a simple way to move forward: Open our government. pay our bills. and start negotiating on the issues that matter. I yield the floor.
1130066861,The budget agreement that we passed is an important step forward for our country and for our government. I know Chairman PATTY MURRAY worked tremendously hard to get to a conference in the first place and to reach this agreement with the House. I commend Chairman MURRAY for all of her work. The U.S. Government has been lurching from crisis to manufactured crisis and using shortterm stopgaps to fund the government. The threat of a shutdown and the lack of uncertainty has hurt our economy and has eroded the American peoples confidence in our ability to solve problems. It is our job to produce a budget and to figure out a way to work together and not shut the government down. That is what the people expect of responsible leaders in a divided government. This budget agreement is the way to move forward. It ends the reckless threats of government shutdown and lays a clear path to end sequestration. The sequester hit my home State of Hawaii very hard. The acrosstheboard arbitrary cuts from sequester have been devastating for our middleclass families and to our economy. I wish to read a letter that I received from a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in September. He wrote: I was contacted today. as I often am. by a student wanting to join our graduate program in the Department of Geology and Geophysics. Unfortunately. I had to tell this student that funding for accepting new students is low right now. which may make it impossible for me to accept him as a graduate student. despite his excellent qualifications. This exchange reminded me that one source of the problem is the budget cuts to NSF (and other science funding agencies) that are the result of sequestration. The current situation is having the following impacts. which are happening right now at research centers nationwide. including UH Manoa: Many scientific workers are being laid off or are not being hired this includes individuals in Honolulu. Research groups are being forced to cut infrastructure that took decades to build. Some scientific discoveries that could help our society are not being made. Some bright young students are not being given opportunities to advance their scientific careers. I think that this last point is the saddest result because. it negatively impacts the hopes and dreams of many young people. Furthermore. these students are the future of our scientific workforce people that will be leading us toward the innovation and problemsolving that is crucial for our countrys future. This professor urged me and this Congress to do everything that we can to roll back the sequester. That is one of the many reasons why I supported the budget today. Sequestration caused Federal workers to be furloughed or laid off throughout Hawaii. Sequestration hurt our national defense. U.S. competitiveness. and harmed education programs. Head Start in Hawaii had to cut children from its programs this year. This early education program is critical for a young childs success later in life. Some of these kids and parents dont have other options without Head Start. Without this budget agreement. there would have been an additional $20 billion cut to our defense programs hitting next month. Those defense cuts are going to disproportionately hurt my home State of Hawaii. Without this budget agreement. 25.000 Federal civilian workers in Hawaii could be furloughed or laid off. Hawaii cant afford that. I voted for this budget to prevent those cuts. The bipartisan budget agreement finally provides relief from the sequester and a path forward to get our economy on the right track. Most importantly. the budget protects Social Security and Medicare benefits. Although this budget is the right choice for many reasons. we know it is not perfect. I do believe we need to work together to improve parts of it. I find it unacceptable and inexplicable that the House of Representatives left town for the holidays without extending longterm unemployment benefits. and I know we are working on making it a priority as soon as we return in January. In addition. Senator SHAHEEN has introduced legislationwhich I am proud to support and cosponsorto protect military retirees from the costofliving pay adjustment. The costofliving pay adjustment wont take effect until January of 2015. which means that we have time to fix this issue. but we must fix this issue. This legislation that I am cosponsoring with Senator SHAHEEN will fully pay for the change by closing a loophole that some companies are using to avoid paying U.S. taxes with offshore tax havens. This is a commonsense fix that I believe we can get bipartisan support for. We need a longterm budget. but not at the expense of our military retirees. We can replace the money raised by closing this tax loophole that some companies are abusing. We have time to fix this issue. and we have to do so before 2015. But now is the time to move forward. to protect jobs. and to give our country some economic certainty. I yield the floor.
1130083621,Mr. President. I rise today to discuss the important role that energy efficiency plays in our transition to a clean energy economy. and the importance of supporting energy efficiency efforts with strong Federal policy. Today. Senators CARDIN. FEINSTEIN. and I introduced comprehensive legislation. called the Energy Efficiency Tax Incentives Act of 2014. to reform. improve. and extend crucial tax incentives for energy efficiency. Our legislation focuses on three key sectors: commercial buildings. homes. and industry and manufacturing. My colleagues have spoken ably about the first two already today. and I would like to spend a few moments discussing the third title of this bill. This bill would create targeted. nonpermanent incentives to help the U.S. industrial sector become more globally competitive by employing smart technological improvements to reduce energy use and encourage water reuse. We have continually seen the eagerness of U.S. industries to innovate and improve the processes by which they produce countless highquality goods. This set of incentives will help U.S. manufacturers accelerate and expand cuttingedge ideas while also reducing costs. Industrial and manufacturing facilities have processes specific to each industry and even to each facility. Therefore. industrial efficiency improvements must be focused on these processes. not building retrofits like we see in commercial and residential efficiency measures. My colleagues and I have worked to develop incentives that target energyintensive processes common to the industrial sector. They include advanced motors. water reuse. combined heat and power and waste heat recovery. thermal biomass. and efficient chillers. I would like to take a few moments to describe the various sections of the industrial efficiency title of the bill. On average. motors account for over 65 percent of an industrial energy users electricity use. according to analysis by the International Energy Agency. This bill creates a credit for advanced industrial use motors. including variable speed motors. New advances in power electronics and controls over the past 5 years have advanced the potential for new smart motor technologies to provide a significant energy savings potential if these new motors are placed widely into service. According to the National Water Reuse Association. the U.S. currently reuses only 7.3 percent of its water. and there is significant potential for gains in this area. The industrial sector. which is responsible for 62.5 percent of domestic freshwater withdrawals. is an ideal place to introduce transformative water reuse and water saving technologies. The bill would create a technologyneutral. performancebased investment tax credit for reuse. recycling. and/or efficiency measures related to industrial water reuse in the manufacturing sector. A recent Department of Energy study estimates that achieving the Presidents goal of 40 gigawatts of Combined Heat and Power. also known as CHP. would save energy users $10 billion a year compared to current energy use. In 2008. Congress enacted a 10 percent investment tax credit for combined heat and power systems. The bill would expand that credits applicability. from the first 15 megawatts to the first 25 megawatts of system capacity. The bill would also remove the existing overall system size cap of 50 megawatts. allowing a greater number of combined heat and power projects to be financially viable and move forward. Finally. the bill would create two new tiers of the credit for CHP systems that achieve especially high efficiency levels. By encouraging adoption of CHP and waste heat recovery technologies. this bill is a commonsense set of incentives that will help manufacturers to become more efficient. reduce energy costs. create highly skilled jobs. and ensure the delivery of reliable power. New technologies have developed recently that can take advantage of lowgrade heat sources. Called Waste Heat to Power. these systems can achieve even greater levels of efficiency from industrial and manufacturing applications. Currently no incentives exist to promote thermalonly biomass use for commercial and industrial applications. Using biomass for thermal applications has numerous advantages over using biomass to produce electricity. Thermal use is significantly more efficient. less polluting. and more appropriatelyscaled to biomass resources. Finally. large watercooled chillers are the engines of airconditioning systems for almost all large buildings. This bill would establish a tax credit that incentivizes the replacement of older chillers that still use environmentally harmful CFC refrigerants with chillers that are both more efficient and use fewer harmful chemicals. Recent years have seen a resurgence in American industry and manufacturing. As we work to get our economy back on track. become more competitive globally. and fight climate change. we should consider robust efficiency incentives for our industrial sector as a crucial tool in achieving those goals. I would like to commend my colleagues Senator CARDIN and Senator FEINSTEIN for their hard work on this bill. It represents the latest thinking in terms of straightforward. performancebased technologyneutral. nonpermanent efficiency incentives. As we aim to improve efficiency in the industrial. commercial building. and residential sectors. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this critical bill. By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself.
1130090482,Mr. President. on the Senate floor we have been focusing on policies that give Americans a fair shot. bills that would help to reverse the growing trend of income inequality and create more opportunities to climb the economic ladder. the idea that if you work hard and plays by the rules. you can do well for your family and you can create a better opportunity for your children and their children. Making college more affordable and reducing student loan debt is central to these goals. In fact. I think it is the middleclass issue of our generation. It is hard to get ahead nowadays without a college degree. but the cost of college is growing faster than the cost of all other consumer goodstwice as fast as health care costs. The growing cost of college is preventing some from getting a degree in the first place and leaving others with unmanageable levels of debt. This is the middleclass issue of our time. Students have taken on more than $1 trillion in debt to cover the cost of college. Student debt is now the fastest growing and highest consumer debt burden behind mortgages. This debt burden is not sustainable. Saddled with this debt. young adults are delaying starting families. buying homes and cars. and starting new businesses. The rate at which students are failing to repay their loans is alarming. Over onethird of borrowers who are in repayment are delinquent on their loans by 90 days or more. Onethird of borrowers are delinquent. One of my constituents from Wahiawa. HI. took out a loan to help their son go to college. The loan was for $92.000 in 2006. Today they owe $143.000. This local resident says: The interest compounds. Its like a loan shark. pretty close. Theres no way out. No way to pay it. ever. We are hearing these stories far too often from many families in Hawaii and across the country. and they need our help. A college education is supposed to be a path to opportunity and the American dream. not a life of debt. It is clear our current system is not working. The Federal Government is giving $140 billion a year in financial aid to institutions of higher learning in Federal grants and loans. That is good. not bad. Higher education is the straightest line for us to develop the workforce we need and for people to move up the economic ladder. but with that $140 billion we should be making college more affordable for students. Instead. we are getting the opposite result for the $140 billion. Average Pell grant awards have increased by almost 20 percent in the past 10 years. In that same time period. Pell grants covered 25 percent less of the average public schools tuition and fees. We are paying more and we are getting less. There is a growing gap between the financial aid that is available to students and the cost of college. To fill that gap. students are loading up on debt. Last summer. Congress passed a bipartisan student loan compromise that lowered the student loan interest rate for new borrowers. but millions of student borrowers were left out of that deal and are paying much higher rates. I am proud to join Senator WARREN in introducing the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. This bill will allow students with outstanding student loan debt to refinance at the same low interest rates offered to new borrowers under the bipartisan student loan compromise. That is fair. Students struggling with student debt deserve to get the same deal Congress is giving to new borrowers. But when we talk about making colleges more affordable. we need to remember that lowering student loan interest rates is only part of the problem. It is not just the interest. it is the principal. We need a bold longterm plan to bring down the cost of college. That is why I introduced the College Affordability and Innovation Act with Senators CHRIS MURPHY. PATTY MURRAY. and BERNIE SANDERS. The bill is about holding schools accountable to taxpayers and students. We want to reward those schools that are focused on affordability and give incentives for the rest to make affordability part of their mission. If you are a college. you can have whatever mission you want. but you have no special right to Federal funding. Our bill says. very simply. if you receive Federal dollars. part of your mission must be about affordability and access. There are potentially billions of dollars that are not being used wisely. As we invest in higher educationand we should. through student loan subsidies and Federal financial aidwe should make sure schools are actually fulfilling our Federal public policy goals of making college more affordable and more accessible for all students. Lets work together to make sure a college education is a path of opportunity for all students and not a life of debt.
1130117936,Mr. President. September 22nd marks the beginning of National Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. GEAR UP. Week and I would like to take a moment to recognize the invaluable work of GEAR UP in Hawaii. For more than a decade. GEAR UP has provided lowincome students all over the country with the support and resources they need to go to college. GEAR UP helps these students. many of which are the first in their family to go to college. to overcome the challenges they face in their communities. GEAR UP Hawaii serves over 16.000 students each year from lowincome and underserved communities throughout the State in grades 7 through 12 and in their first year in college. The program provides a number of services to these students including: supporting academic preparation in high school. providing opportunities for early college options. increasing college access and financial aid information to students and families. and supporting students in their first year in college. GEAR UP Hawaii has gained national recognition for its success in closing the achievement gap and helping lowincome students prepare for college. Through its collaborative partnerships between Hawaiis State Department of Education. K12 schools. the University of Hawaii. businesses. and community organizations. GEAR UP Hawaii inspires students to see postsecondary education as something they can achieve. It also gives students the tools they need to succeed in college and their careers. The programs results demonstrate that GEAR UP Hawaii is making significant strides towards increasing the number of lowincome students who are prepared for and enroll in college. The first class of Step Up Scholars. a GEAR UP Hawaii program. graduated from high school in June 2013 and earned the collegeready Board of Education Recognition Diploma. BOERD. at nearly twice the rate of the statewide average and three times the rate of nonStep Up Scholars. In addition. across GEAR UP Hawaii schools this past year. there was a 14 percent increase in the number of students participating in dual enrollment programs who graduated high school with six or more college credits. Thanks to these programs. Hawaiis students graduate from high school better prepared for college and for their futures. A college education is a path to opportunity for our students. GEAR UP Hawaii plays a vital role in fulfilling our responsibility to ensure that every student has access to that path.*
1130119124,"Mr. President. I rise to commend the historic agreement reached yesterday between the United States and China. the worlds largest emitters of carbon pollution. This agreement is the latest and perhaps most consequential in a string of actions President Obama has taken to fight climate change. Today. we have hope. We have hope because this agreement puts the world on a path towards solving climate changehope because the worlds two largest emitters have found common cause in protecting public health and economic opportunity for their citizens and for the world and hope because we are once again reminded what American leadership and political will can accomplish. President Obama and President Xi of China recognize that climate change threatens our families. our jobs. our health. and our way of life. They deserve our thanks. as does Secretary Kerry. for their tireless work and dedication to this cause. We can solve this. We know what we need to do. and we know how to do it. Today we see what political will can accomplish. I am now more hopeful than ever that we can keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. This is the level scientists say is necessary to stay below in order to avoid catastrophic global consequences. Together our two countries account for about 40 percent of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions. We have a responsibility to act early and to act together. and this agreement puts us on that path. The agreement recognizes that the United States and China must take short- and longterm measures to reduce emissions and encourage the development of clean energy. This represents a major shift for China. which had struggled to balance economic growth with growing pollution and has now agreed to cap carbon pollution for the first time ever. It is difficult to overstate what an important achievement this is. especially a full year before the next round of international negotiations in Paris. As Secretary Kerry said today. this is a major signal to other countries that they should also put forth ambitious emissions reduction goals well before international negotiations start in 2015. In addition. China has agreed to get a full 20 percent of its energy from zero emission sources by 2030. This means China will have to deploy close to 1.000 gigawatts of new zero emission powerplants. This is the amount of electricity the entire United States currently generates and shows just how serious China is about addressing this problem. American leadership was crucial in forging these goals. It wouldnt have been possible without the Presidents Clean Power Plan. which will reduce emissions from the power sector by 30 percent relative to 2005 levels by the year 2030. This agreement goes beyond even those ambitious targets. and in the coming months and years. it will be important for this President and the next to maintain and strengthen the Environmental Protection Agencys ability to protect Americans from harmful pollution. Despite near universal consensus among climate scientists that the Clean Power Plan is part of the solution to fighting climate change. today that plan is under attack in Congress. Right after the President announced this historic agreement. climate deniers in Congress started rolling out every tired argument in the book. In fact. one of our colleagues here has already dubbed this plan ""unrealistic"" and called it an ""ideological war."" These claims are the last bastion of a hopeless cause that ignores what we see all around usfrom farmers to fishermen to smalltown mayors. Theirs is an untenable position. because poll after poll shows that Americans do care about this issue. They care about it deeply. Americans care because they know fighting climate change is really about protecting their childrens health. protecting economic opportunity. and leaving our children a world better than our own. We are seeing the deniers arguments collapse around them. One of their favorite tropes was to claim that U.S. actions are meaningless without action from China. Well. it looks as though that argument took a fairly big hit yesterday. In fact. the U.S. did act first by developing the Clean Power Plan. The rules havent even been finalized. but they are already giving us the leverage to reach major international agreements. As excuse after excuse fails. we will see climate deniers retreat to tired claims that anything we do to reduce pollution will hurt the economy. But remember that we have heard these claims before. They were wrong then. and they are wrong now. The list is long. so I will mention just a few. Taking the lead out of gasoline. putting catalytic converters in cars. reducing acid rain. all were met with panicky claims of economic devastation. But what we have learned is that keeping our air and our water clean actually helps our economy. This agreement between the United States and China is historic. It is a real breakthrough. and it gives us hope that we will be able to confront and resolve one of the greatest challenges of our time. But it is still just an agreement. We need to follow through with action. We must listen to the American people and amplify their voices as they call for action to preserve our health. our economy. and our way of life. Mr. President. I yield the floor."

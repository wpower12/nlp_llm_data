1130003838,"Mr. Speaker. when I go around in Kansas and talk to folks and talk to them about a business that supports 1.2 million American jobs and over $150 billion of wealth creation across the U.S. economy and ask. ""What do you think a President would do if they knew about an industry like that?"" theyd all say the same thing folks all across the country would say. Theyd say that the President ought to encourage that. ought to thank the people that work in that industry. and ought to promote that industry all across the world. a great Americanmanufactured product doing great things in America. Yet. that industry. the general aviation industry. is used by our President as a rhetorical punching bag. Everywhere he goes. he talks about corporate fatcat jet owners and those rich. wealthy people flying around in corporate airplanes. Well. I know what this industry does. I came from this industry. I know precisely who these people are. When you use language like that and you talk about an American manufacturing industry in that way. youre talking about welders. youre talking about union mechanics. and youre talking about all the support people that work at fixedbase operations all across the country. Youre talking about good. hardworking Americans. not corporate fatcat jet owners. Yet this President continues in the same way that he has. I had hoped that I wouldnt have to come back and talk about it again. but I anticipate that tonight. from this very Chamber. well hear about those same corporate fatcat jet owners yet again. The general aviation industry doesnt ask for a handout. and it doesnt need what Detroit received. It only asks that a President acknowledge and recognize the importance of this industry. It creates aircraft that are used by small businessowners all across the Nation to get to places they need to be. Every week. I fly on commercial aircraft from here back to Wichita. Kansas. Its no easy task. If you want to get to two or three of your suppliers or four or five of your customers in a day located all throughout the heartland. the most efficient tool to use to do that is a general aviation airplane. And. of course. we know the President understands that. Mr. Speaker. He flies around in the nicest personal aircraft in the history of the world. actually built in Wichita. Kansas. And government employees use general aviation aircraft to travel all around the country. They do so because it is an efficient means of conducting their business. Now. when the President talks about these corporate fatcat jet owners. hes doing so because he says he wants to close a loophole. he wants to generate more money coming to Washington. D.C.. and he talks about this subsidy. We looked long and hard to find out what subsidy it was he was referring to. Frankly. we think it is a depreciation schedulea depreciation schedulesomething that every asset in America is subject to. Yet. somehow. he has picked on this particular depreciation schedule as offensive and antithetical to the American way of life. Mr. President. the revenue that is generated in 1 year if we eliminated the provision about which we think youre speaking. Mr. Speaker. would generate enough revenue to run the government for a single day1 day. Yet. Mr. Speaker. the President continues to use this language of class warfare against an industry that has created so many tens of thousands of jobs all across our country. It is unexplainable why anyone would be critical of this industry. The President has also proposed a new tax. a general aviation fee. of $100 per flight segment. which would require an entire new bureaucracy to implement and to execute. It is incomprehensible to me why anyone would think that was the right approach. Mr. Speaker. I have invited the President of the United States to come to Wichita. Kansas. to see Beechcraft. to see Cessna. and to see Learjet and to see all the suppliers and all of the people who work so hard to make these airplanes. He has not taken me up on that yet. Mr. Speaker. I urge that he do so. But. sadly. if he continues to decline and continues to talk about this industry in the way that he does. he will not suffer. but tens of thousands of Americans who work on these airplanes all across the country will. I hope. Mr. Speaker. that the President will change his direction. change his course of action. and recognize the value of this important industry."
1130027561,"Mr. Speaker. its been just under 2 months since the attacks in Boston. and in those intervening weeks. the silence of Muslim leaders has been deafening. And that is sad. but perhaps most importantly. its dangerous. There have now been at least a dozen attacks by Muslim terrorists on U.S. soil since Ramzi Yousefs parked rental van exploded in the basement of the World Trade Center on February 26 of 1993. Some have caused death and injury. such as the 9111 attacks in 2001 and Nidal Hasans mass shooting at Fort Hood. Texas. Other attacks. such as Faisal Shahzads fizzled Times Square bombing. or the unsuccessful underwear bombing of a flight. were thwarted or aborted. But yet. fatal or not. all of these attacks were successful in scaring Americans. successful in reducing our freedom in the most freedomloving Nation on Earth. successful in slowing our economy. and successful in demonstrating that an open society can potentially be vulnerable. They were. in former Attorney General Mike Mukaseys words. ""crimes that are nonetheless meant to send a terrorist message."" When the most devastating terrorist attacks on America in the last 20 years come overwhelmingly from people of a single faith. and are performed in the name of that faith. a special obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith. Instead of responding. silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and. more importantly still. in those that may well follow. If a religion claims to be one of peace. Mr. Speaker. its leaders must reject violence that is perpetrated in its name. Some clerics today suggest that modern jihad is nonviolent. and is only about making oneself a better Muslim. Perhaps thats true for moderate Muslims. But extremists seek to revive the era when most Islamic clerics understood jihad to be holy war. Mr. Speaker. decades of Middle Eastern oil money have propounded this more extreme. violent interpretation in mosques around the world. Less than 2 months after the 9111 atrocities. an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood preacher. who is probably the most influential Sunni cleric today. declared suicide bombing to be legitimate. He said. ""these are heroic commando and martyrdom attacks and should not be called suicide."" So what is it that these Islamic leaders must say? First. that there is never any justification for terrorism. No political goal legitimizes terrorism. Terrorism is never excusable as resistance. Imams must state unequivocally that terrorists actions. killing and maiming. sully Islam. They must also publicly and repeatedly denounce radical clerics who seek to justify terrorism. There is a battle of interpretation within Islam. Its not enough to deny responsibility by saying ones own interpretation doesnt support terrorism. Moderate imams must strive to ensure that no Muslim finds solace for terrorism in the Koran. They must cite the Koran as evidence that the murder of innocents is not permitted by good. believing Muslims. and must immediately refute all claims to the contrary. Finally. Muslim leaders must say that there is no room for militant Islamism in the religion of peace. These statements must be made publicly. frequently and in the mosques. yes. in the mosques and in the madrassas. where many learn their Islamic religion. You know. we have to call evil by its name in order to stamp it out. Downplaying atrocities and rampages ensures more of them. Every Muslim leader must unequivocally proclaim that terror committed in the name of Islam violates the core tenets of the Prophet Mohammed. and they must do so repeatedly. period. My own faith has occasionally been hijacked in the name of violence and cruelty. including in Kansas. my home State. by Fred Phelps and his Westboro Baptist Church. In response. hundreds of Protestant ministers preach that Mr. Phelps actions violate the most fundamental Christian traditions. and they have denounced him and his churchs evil acts. Pope John Paul II similarly apologized. in 2000. for the Catholic Churchs failure to do more to speak out against the evils of Nazism. and to protect Jews from the Holocaust. Just as these religious leaders have called up those who have killed and acted brutally in the name of their faith. so too must Muslim religious leaders refute terrorist theology. Were now 2 decades into Islamic radicals attacking Americans on U.S. soil. I know that not every Muslim supports these actions. Dr. Zuhdi Jasser of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy has spoken out in a clear and consistent way. So has Zainab alSuwaij of the American Islamic Congress. But the silence in the face of extremism coming from the bestfunded Islamic advocacy organizations and many mosques across America is absolutely deafening. It casts doubt upon the commitment to peace by adherents of the Muslim faith. This is utterly unacceptable. it is dangerous. it must end."
1130037770,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the general aviation industry and ask my fellow Members to support the Small Aircraft Revitalization Act. This commonsense. broadly bipartisan regulatory reform bill will spur economic growth. improve aviation safety. and help strengthen the health of the lighter. entrylevel segment of the industry. Mr. Speaker. there is no better reason to support this legislation than it saves lives and improves lives. Think about that. We can do both in one fell swoop. Lets first talk about how the bill improves lives. I represent Wichita. Kansas. It is the Air Capital of the World. It is home to Cessna and Learjet and Beechcraft and dozens and dozens and dozens of suppliers to those great aviation businesses with such great aviation histories. Its the home of the National Institute for Aviation Research and the National Center for Aviation Training. There are engineers. machinists. researchers. flight instructors. fixed base operators. among others. that all depend on a healthy general aviation industry. And then there are the operators in the industry and general aviation. This vital productivity tool for both small and large companies is critically important. Sixteen years ago. I joined the Kansas general aviation industry. building a business with three of my colleagues. founding a company called Thayer Aerospace. a machine shop in Wichita. Kansas. We made parts for the thriving aircraft industry. but the downturn in 2008 was a tremendous blow to Wichita. in particular. and general aviation. more generally. We experienced thousands and thousands of layoffs and dramatic downsizing all across the region. The downturn exacerbated the unique challenges that the lighter. entrylevel segment of general aviation had been experiencing over the past several decades. Today. the average general aviation airplane is 40 years old. That means most of the new aircraft were built in the 1960s and 1970s. with designs of that same vintage. Current general aviation production represents less than 2 percent of the existing fleet. Weve had an over 10.000personperyear decline in active private pilots over this last decade. The steady decline in new pilots. flight activity. and the sales of new small general aviation airplanes that result from that are indicators of significant problems in the industry. To tackle this problem. this bill. the Small Aircraft Revitalization Act. requires the FAA to implement the FAAs part 23 certification process and modernize it no later than 2015. The FAA Part 23 Reorganization Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC). composed of aviation authorities and industry representatives from around the world. has worked over the last 18 months to create a regulatory environment that will contribute to revitalizing the health and safety of new and existing airplanes. These changes will remove lots and lots of barriers and it will improve lives. Let me tell you how it will save lives. The gentleman from Wisconsin talked about safety and innovation being retarded by the absence of a streamlined regulatory process. He spoke of this example of ""loss of control."" That creates more than three times the cause of aviation accidents than any other single cause. Since the dawn of aviation. weve taught pilots how to avoid that. but because they remain a significant safety problem. theres tremendous interest in technology and interventions to resolve it. And yet todays part 23 makes that more difficult. By putting these technologies into the new and existing fleet. its widely believed that the safety of light general aviation aircraft could see dramatic improvements. We need to cut this red tape. It will create savings for sure. but. more importantly. it will save lives. This is a commonsense and important reform. Americas general aviation industry is not asking for a single handout. not one subsidy. Its simply asking for a streamlined set of regulations that will permit them to get their airplanes. their designs to market more quickly. and still doing so safely. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER and Chairman LOBIONDO for their support. and my original cosponsors. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. and Mr. ROKITA. and all the folks of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on both sides of the aisle that have allowed this bill to get this far and make it to the floor. I urge support of all of my colleagues this evening and hope well have a unanimous vote on behalf of this bill."
1130040879,Mr. Chairman. the amendment I offer this evening clarifies and confirms the scope of two programs that Mr. Snowden illegally exposed while sitting in a hotel room in Communist China. First. the amendment clarifies that under section 702 no U.S. citizen or person in the U.S. can be targeted. period. I say again. no U.S. person under section 702 may be targeted in any way by the United States Government. While there are other specific authorities the U.S. person may be subject to an investigation. the U.S. Government may not do so under section 702. Thats what this amendment intends to clarify. The second part of the amendment clarifies section 215. also known as section 501 of FISA. The amendment clarifies that no content of communications can be stored or collected by the National Security Agencythats no emails. no video clips. no Skype. No record of the actual conversation or the contents thereof may be recorded or collected by the National Security Agency. I cant repeat that enough. Thats the intent of this amendment. I want to make clear to everyone that. contrary to the suggestions of some. the NSA has not been acting outside of the scope of its authorities. The MetaData program is carefully designed with program layers of oversight by all three branchs of government. This is precisely the way our government ought to operate. with input from Article I and Article II and Article III of the United States Constitution. It is. of course. our duty to ensure that the NSA stays within these legal bounds here in Congress. and this amendment makes those boundaries perfectly clear for everyone to know and understand. And we shouldnt mislead the American people into thinking that the NSA has been acting illegally. There is perhaps no program in the United States Government that is as carefully monitored and overseen as the programs this amendment attempts to clarify. To the extent that some in this Chamber wish to review or provide more protections and controls for these programs. we should proceed through a carefully considered and debated legislative process so that the full implications for our security are clearly understood. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130051639,"Thank you for yielding. I appreciate the time. I imagine. Ms. JENKINS. youre hearing some of the same things as I am as you return to Kansas and talk to our constituents. This is serious business. Were standing here tonight with a partial government shutdown. and I dont think anybody thinks thats the best outcome for America. I think we all want Americas essential vital services and systems to be functioning and up and running. but what were dealing with in the Affordable Care Act is also a very serious matter. Its very real. Its not a game. Ive heard some across the aisle suggest that by trying our best to fund the pieces of the government that matter and not fund the Affordable Care Act. were taking hostages. I find that language. in one sense. offensive. But most importantly. I find it inaccurate. It doesnt represent what were trying to do. Were not taking hostages. What were trying to do is take account of what our constituents are telling us. and I want to talk about that just a little bit. I tried to get online yesterday myself to enroll in the Affordable Care Act. I was met with a bit of a blank screen and a long pause. I did manage to get through to the 1800 phone number that was provided on the screen. I was told if I stayed on the line. 20 minutes later Id get a live voice. Some hour and 40 minutes later. I did manage to get a live voice. There was great music in the interim. And I got a live voice. It was a young lady who told me she was from Louisiana. She said. Why did you call? I said. Im calling to comply with the Federal law. She said. Im not going to be able to help you with that today. My system is down. too. She was a government contractor working out of Louisiana. I asked her how long shed been working on this. She said. Quite a while. In fact. yesterday wasnt the first day of the Affordable Care Act. Were now some 3 years into it. Its not the case that the bill was passed and there wasnt enough time to have this system ready. I imagine some of the kinks will get worked out. The President calls them hiccups. I hope the hiccups are the worst medical ailment that comes from the Affordable Care Act. but I fear that they wont be the worst ailment. In fact. Ive already heard countless stories. Ill recount just three of them. Just today. I received an email from a small employer with about 60 folks throughout Kansas. He indicated to me that he just received this week a letter indicating that his health insurance premiums for his businesshes the number two guy in the companywere going to be up somewhere between 30 and 40 percent. He reminded that his health care premiums had gone up before. but he said hed never seen anything like this. A real impact. there will be a real impact. Hes trying to figure out. what do you do? How much of that cost gets passed on in copays and deductibles to the employees? How much of that cost does the company eat. making them less competitive in the global environment in which theyre trying to compete. A real story from a real Kansas business impacting real lives. I spoke 3 weeks ago. when I was last back in Kansas. with a number of folks from some smaller hospitals in the rural part of south central Kansas. Those are called critical access care hospitals. They serve vital functions for less densely populated parts of our country. I was talking about the impact of the Affordable Care Act and they said. you know. things have been tough at some of these hospitals before. There are times when its difficult to make ends meet and to provide all the services that people need. Does come in from Wichita and from Kansas City and from other places to help parttime to provide these services in rural parts of the State. They said that after the Affordable Care Act it would be even more difficult. almost impossible. to keep these hospitals open and functioning and providing these valuable services. Real lives. real Kansans. real people with a real impact from the Affordable Care Act. Finally. I met with a young couple during that same trip home. Both of them work. They work at jobs where they were working for 40 hours a week and have now been told its likely that they wont. They were still working 40 hours a week at the time. Their employer had just put them on notice and had suggested then that they begin to look for second jobs. or that maybe one spouse should leave that company and go work someplace else. Of course the rationale that had been provided by these peoples employer was that if they continue to have fulltime employeeswhat America has always had. fulltime employees. 40hour workweeksthat there would be an enormous cost that would flow to that employer where they simply couldnt keep the business running with a fulltime work staff. So heres two folks that had pretty good health benefits. great jobs. 40houraweek jobs. jobs they were very happy with. jobs that permitted them to take care of their families. and their life is going to be changed. Real Kansans. real lives affected by the Affordable Care Act. Weve seen this kind of thing all too often. I suspect that some of these glitches at the beginning will probably get worked out. but you cant fix provisions like that without fundamental changes to the Affordable Care Act. I think thats pretty evident. The President had seen this all coming. The President chose to provide waivers for lots and lots of groups. Lots of folks who have come and said: This is harsh. this is penal. this is not working. and the President said: Heres a waiver. Here. you can have a change. Thats just not the American way. Its not the way that we operate here. where we try to provide health care systems that are the same and fair and equal for all American citizens and all American employers and everyone who is trying to make their way and take care of their own families. These are very real issues. I have seen this fight over these last few weeks. Its no different than the same discussions that have been taking place for 3 years. Ive been here almost that long in Congress where weve been talking about what we thought would happen when this day came. when. for the first time. people would have to begin to think about what real costs were. what it was really going to look like. And I wish. I truly wish that we had overblown the risk. we had overdramatized what was really going to happen. that we had falsely alerted the American people that the Affordable Care Act was going to be a train wreck or a disaster. but. sadly. I think the evidence. as it mounts. as it comes in. demonstrates that we may have underestimated the risk. We may have underestimated how badly this is going to impact the American economy. We may have underestimated how many primary care physicians are going to just say ""I cant make a go of this anymore"" and leave the practice. After all. right. its not about insurance. its not about having a piece of paper or a card that says youre entitled to health care. Its about receiving health care. Its about being fixed when youve got something broken. Its about being cured when youve got something thats made you sick. This isnt about paper. This isnt about politics. This is about real lives and kids who need treatment. Its not enough to say: Its wonderful. I have this thing called ObamaCare. but I cant find a physician who will treat me. These are the kind of things that we need to work on and need to try and fix. I will say this lastly. There has been some suggestion that this is partisan. this is about Democrats versus Republicans. For me. this is not it at all. The President made a statement yesterday. He said this bill was popular. this is why the system was overcrowded and you couldnt get on. Its not popular. its a law. These people didnt go on this health care system because they like it. They did so because they were required to do so on pain of penalty by the Federal Government. I saw today someone who had been told that if they didnt comply. they might end up with a tax lien because they didnt pay a penalty. This is not the American way. This is not a health care system thats going to work. I hope my colleagues will help us. I hope they will come to see that all were asking for at this point in time is not what wed really likeweve compromised already. What we would like to see at this point is we are happy to compromise and settle just for a short time. just for a delay. to try and make it better. to try and impact those real people. those real Kansans who are going to be really impacted by a law which wont do what it is the President promised it would do."
1130063478,"Mr. Chairman. I thank Chairman WHITFIELD and Chairman UPTON for helping me work this bill through our committee. It is great to have it on the floor today. We now have a bipartisan piece of legislation aimed at making simple. commonsense reforms to the natural gas pipeline permitting process. Rather than eliminating environmental regulations and permits. H.R. 1900 takes a very reasonable approach by requiring agencies involved in the permitting of natural gas pipelines. simply requesting that they finish their work in a timely manner. The legislation builds off reforms made in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. which placed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the lead agency for interstate natural gas pipelines. As we have heard this morning. natural gas is becoming a dominant force in the electricity generation and manufacturing sectors. It is critical that pipeline construction can take place through a modernized permitting process. and that is what this bill aims to do. The current interstate natural gas pipeline permitting process. established in 2005. is already in need of updating because of the enormous shale gas boom. H.R. 1900 makes changes to the interstate natural gas pipeline permitting process by simply putting in place statutory deadlines for each of the permitting agencies to complete their work. This is pretty reasonable. We are simply asking agencies to do what the law requires them to do. They can say ""yes"" to a permit. they can deny the permit. but they cant sit on it. They have to do their homework. They have to get the job done. FERC is already the lead agency for coordinating environmental review of interstate natural gas pipelines. and as FERC testified in front of the Energy and Commerce Committee earlier this year. the deadlines imposed by H.R. 1900 are reasonable. In fact. FERC asked for a couple of changes in the legislation. and in each case we made those changes at their request. If. after H.R. 1900 were to become law. an agency doesnt complete its work. the permit would automatically be approved by statute. I have heard others say this is unprecedented. but that is simply not the case. There are numbers of examples all throughout the Federal code where statutory approvals of environmental permits are deemed approved in the absence of the agency saying to the contrary. I cant imagine anyone saying that this legislation is radical or unprecedented. More importantly. I cant see that they could claim that it is unnecessary. To my left you can see the impact of the absence of natural gas infrastructure all across the country. Frankly. in Kansas. we are in pretty good shape. but on the east coast. here in the Northeast where I am standing today. and on the west coast. you see enormously high natural gas costs: 24 percent above the national average in New York. 20 percent above the national average in Arizona. 67 percent above the national average in Maine. and 68 percent above the national average for the cost of natural gas in the State of Florida. We are seeing these prices rise because we dont have infrastructure development adequate to meet the needs of manufacturers and consumers in these places. The New York Times. that bastion of conservatism. wrote the following. saying that FERC was ""concerned about increasing reliance on natural gasfuel generators at times when there is an increasingly tight availability of pipeline capacity to deliver natural gas from the south and the west to New England."" The Boston Globe. writing about pipeline projects in New England. said that the projects come ""as New England struggles to address growing demand for natural gas and supply constraints created by tight pipeline capacity. Those constraints have led to shortages and price spikes during the peak demand periods. such as extended winter cold snaps. helping to drive the regions already high energy costs even higher."" The New York Times and the Boston Globe recognize the need for H.R. 1900. This is not a manufactured crisis or bill in search of a problem. This is a real issue with real consequences for jobs in America and for average working families all across our country. The bill will give certainty to natural gas pipeline developers that invest in projects which could transport affordable energy to consumers all across the Nation. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1900 and address a very real issue impacting consumers and manufacturers all across the country."
1130063503,Mr. Chairman. a couple of points are worth noting to make sure that everybody understands exactly what we are up against. There has been some suggestion that this is unnecessary. and maybe in the eyes of some in Washington. some political officials. it is unnecessary. but the people who this matters toconsumers. manufacturers all across the countryknow that this is a necessary piece of legislation. The National Association of Manufacturers has said that this is something that would be important to creating manufacturing jobs for families all across the country. The Chamber of Commerce has similarly made this comment. It was earlier stated that some folks were unaware of union support for this legislation. I want to make sure that everyone is fully aware that the Laborers International Union of North America. the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters. and the operating engineers have all been supportive of H.R. 1900 and the importance of energy infrastructure expanding all across our country. Finally. there has been this idea that FERC approves 90 percent of the permits. It has been repeated time and time again. It is just factually incomplete. It is like. if you like your health insurance plan. you can keep it. Technically perhaps true in the most narrow sense. but in reality. it is not the case that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approves 90 percent of all permits or that they are all approved. FERC is but one of many. many agencies that has the authority to approve and deny permits. So this 90 percent number that continues to be thrown around is just false. We dont have 90 percent of all folks seeking to build pipelines being able to build those pipelines in a timely fashion. They are being delayed. There is real demand for this. There is demand from the New England Ratepayers Association. There is demand in States like Florida. where the natural gas rates are 60 percent higher than the national average. This is a real need. This is a real challenge. And if we do this. if we get H.R. 1900 passed. all we are simply saying is do your job. Finish the process. If you decide that the permit shouldnt be built. any of these agencies can deny that permit being built. That seems fine. We are not denying any agency the capacity to deny a permit. But do the work. Tell these folks that. No. you are not going to get it. and then allow the process to move forward. These unions. these associations. these real hardworking families need natural gas at an affordable price to be delivered to them. and H.R. 1900 will help achieve that objective.
1130063555,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to this amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan . which would strike the entire piece of legislation and replace it with a GAO study. The GAO back in February of this year issued a report detailing what they called the ""complex"" natural gas pipeline permitting process. This amendment would simply ask the GAO to duplicate many of those same findings that were done in a report issued less than a year ago. and there is simply no need for that. I understand the gentleman from Michigan thinks this legislation is unnecessary. but I respectfully disagree. I will give one example of where the claims regarding the approval timelines for natural gas permit pipelines have been dubious. It has been erroneously repeated by opponents of this legislation that FERC testified in front of the Energy and Commerce Committee that 90 percent of the permits are being done on time. This is simply not the case. This is not what FERC stated in their testimony. It stated that 90 percent of the certificates are being completed within 12 months. There is an awful lot of difference between a certificate and a permit. FERC is in control of only the certificate process. but they are at the mercy of other agencies with respect to the permit approval process. This is the main reason for the need for this legislation. because FERC has absolutely no enforcement authority over the other agencies to process permits on schedule. This brings accountability to other agencies. Even though 90 percent of certificates are being processed by FERC in the 12month period. it doesnt tell the full story. It would be talking about the bills that the House of Representatives passed and talking only about our naming of post offices and not talking about the substantive legislation. the important things. we do here in the House of Representatives. I would also remind the gentleman from Michigan that the need for this legislation is so great that it garners support not just from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. but also the major electricity trade associations across the country: Edison Electric Institute. the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. and the American Public Power Association. as well as the New England Ratepayers Association. whose members are experiencing skyrocketing natural gas prices. This amendment would gut the bill and ignore the core problem of stubbornly high natural gas prices in certain regions across the Nation. It dismisses the need for an improved permitting process for natural gas pipeline infrastructure completely. For that reason. I urge my colleagues to vote ""no"" on the gentlemans agreement. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130095001,"Madam Chairwoman. today. I rise to ask my fellow Members of Congress to take one small step towards fiscal sanity. Chairman WOLF has done very nice work on this bill. but we are all familiar with agencies that have outlived their usefulness and no longer can withstand budget scrutiny. In these times. if we dont set priorities. nothing is a priority. Here is one opportunity for all of us to make one tiny step towards getting rid of what is now over $17 trillion in debt. We often talk on our side of the aisle about having a spending problem. Here is a chance for all of us on both sides of the aisle to begin to attack that. We have an opportunity. Part of the Department of Commerce. the Economic Development Administration. was established in 1965 as an element of President Lyndon Johnsons Great Society. The current administration and. to be frank. many administrations. have used this for their own pork barrel projects and their own cookie jar. The EDA has spent over $3.2 billion in grants and does nothing more than pick amongst winners and losers by region. industry. and community. At its very core. the EDA is nothing more than the purest of wealth distribution programs. My amendment would eliminate funding for the EDA. totaling $247 million in fiscal year 2015. and send this money to the deficit reduction account. Based on current levels. eliminating EDA will save over $2.5 billion over the next decade. Even though I ran two small businesses for 16 years. I had never heard of the Economic Development Administration before coming to Congress. I suspect many of my colleagues are similarly situated. First. let me describe what the EDA does. It takes dollars from all across the country. That money comes to Washington where the EDA takes 20 percent of it off the top. That is the cost of the administrative burden of running the Economic Development Administration. They then ask companies and communities to apply for ""free money"" from the Federal Government to renovate a movie theater or to build a new industrial park. While many much these projects arent necessarily bad. some are just plain ridiculous. These are local projects that either have enough support from their local communities so they could certainly advance without Federal funding or they require Federal money because the local community wont support them. Either way. the Federal Government has no role in being involved. You might not be familiar with EDA projects. so let me just talk about a couple of them. In 2008. the Economic Development Administration provided $2 million to begin construction of the UNLV Harry Reid Research and Technology Park in Las Vegas. Nevada. Currently. this technology park features a paved road and a Web site claiming to be the first anticipated tenant moving in in 2010. No construction has even begun. In 2010. $25 million was spent by the EDA for a Global Climate Mitigation Incentive Fund and $2 million for a ""culinary amphitheater."" winetasting room. and gift shop in Washington State. The EDA then gave New Mexico $1.5 million to renovate a theater in 2012. In 2013 it gave Massachusetts $1.4 million to promote video games. Back in the 1980s. the EDA used taxpayer dollars to build replicas of the Great Wall of China and the Egyptian pyramids in the middle of Indiana. They were never completed. It is now a dumping ground for tires. After doling out your tax dollars. the Economic Development Administration often. along with a local Congressman or Senator. takes credit for these projects. They go to ribbon cuttings. The EDA is a frequent flyer. traveling all around the country. for just such ceremonies. I first heard about the EDA in one such project. I was sitting in a committee where the director of the EDA proudly took credit for the jobs created at a $1.6 billion new steel plant. There was a $1.4 million grant. less than onetenth of 1 percent of the project. My guess is that the companys CFO knew nothing of the EDA grant. Cutting the EDA. however. is not just a conservative idea. it is a good idea. and one that gets us closer to fiscal sanity here in America. Madam Chairwoman. my amendment is fairly modest given the amount of debt we are piling onto our children and grandchildren. But this is an important vote to show that Members of this body are serious about limiting the size and scope of our Federal Government. I urge passage of this amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time."

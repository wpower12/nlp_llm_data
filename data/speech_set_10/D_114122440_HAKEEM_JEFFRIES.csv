1140001893,I thank my good friend. the distinguished gentleman from Queens. for anchoring this Special Order hour and for yielding a few moments for me to reflect on the passing of our great Governor. Mario Cuomo. Mr. Speaker. like many other members of the New York delegation. I also served in the New York State Assembly. But unlike most. I didnt get the opportunity to serve alongside Governor Mario Cuomo. I arrived several years after he had completed his three terms in office. So I speak today not from the perspective of someone who served in government alongside Mario Cuomo. but as a young man who grew up in Mario Cuomos New York. What an opportunity to be able to come of age in the 1980s with a Governor. a leader. who articulated such an eloquent vision of equal protection under the law for everyone. What an opportunity to be able to come of age under a Governor who believed in opportunity for everyone. who recognized that New York States greatest strength was our diversity from every community. every perspective. and every religious background. It was great to be able to come of age and look up at a Governor who. notwithstanding the political potential pitfalls. stood on principle. was ahead of his time as it relates to his firm opposition to the death penalty at a time when that was not a popular position to take. He was a great leader. a charismatic intellectual. a wonderful family man. a tremendous lawyer. and a wonderful statesman and Governor. I can only imagine that when Mario Cuomo arrived up in Heaven he was prepared to get to work. But I think that there was probably a greeting committee that was there at the gates of Heaven. one of whom was FDR. a former Governor of the State of New York. the other of whom was FDRs cousin. Teddy Roosevelt. two former great Governors of the State of New York. And I think they probably ushered Mario Cuomo to a place in front of the throne of glory where Almighty God Himself may have said to Governor Cuomo: Listen. you can take your suit off and put this robe on. Governor Cuomo. you can rest now. You have been faithful over a few things. You can rest now. Well done. My good and faithful servant. well done.
1140007311,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in full support of President Obamas fiscal year 2016 budget. It is a budget that is firmly rooted in middle class economics. designed to benefit working families and middleincome Americans. It is a budget that will facilitate access to quality. affordable child care and will dramatically expand prekindergarten education in a way that will allow the children of middle class Americans to get off to a faster start in life. President Obamas budget. with the full support of House Democrats. will also address wage stagnation. It is designed to put more incomemore moneyin the pockets of middle class Americans and of those who aspire to be part of the middle class. It will address the fact that. since the early 1970s. the productivity of the American worker has increased consistently. yet middle class wages have remained stagnant. That is a systematic problem that President Obama. Leader PELOSI. and House Democrats are determined to address on behalf of the middle class. President Obamas budget is also designed to increase the affordability of a college education. We know that Americans right now are burdened with more than $1 trillion in student loan debt. That type of debt limits the ability of younger Americans to purchase a home. to start a family. to open up a new business. to take a chance. It limits their ability to robustly access the American Dream. President Obamas budget is designed to allow the sons and daughters of the middle class to pursue their dreams in a more meaningful fashion. When President Obama took office. he inherited an economic train wreck as a result of the Great Recession that was handed to him by the policies of the previous Republican administration. Through the leadership of President Obama. working closely with Democrats in the House and the Senate. we have turned the economy around. We have gotten it back on the right track. So the question that we in this Congress face today is: Will we continue the policies of middle class economics. which are designed to benefit working families and moderate income Americans. or are we going to regress to the policies of trickledown economics. which have failed middle class Americans time and time again? I am in my second term. When I first got to the Congress. I assumed that trickledown economics was dead. doomed by the fact that it has failed over and over again. Apparently. it has been revived. In its most recent incarnation. House Republicans would like to drop the top tax rate from 39.6 percent on the wealthiest Americans all the way down to 25 percent. Their argument is: ""Dont worry. everybody is going to benefit."" But that hasnt worked in the past. In fact. I am convinced that middle class economics is far more preferable to trickledown economics. which. as it relates to the middle class. simply means you may be lucky to get a trickle. but you are guaranteed to stay down. That is what the record says. Bill Clinton inherited a recession. The top tax rate on highincome earners was 31 percent. He raised it to 39.6 percent. and the purveyors of trickledown economics predicted economic doom and gloom. What happened when President Clinton focused on the middle class? More than 20 million jobs were created. He then handed over a budget surplus to President Bush and his coconspirators in the Congress. and like drunken sailors. they blew that budget surplus on failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and on a tax cut that disproportionately benefited the wealthy and the well off. Did trickledown economics work when they dropped the top tax rate to 35 percent? No. During the Bush Presidency. 650.000plus jobs were lost. President Obama inherited this economic mess. and in partnership with Democrats in the House and in the Senate. he renewed his focus on the middle class. He even raised the top tax rate back up to 39.6 percent. Doom and gloom was predicted. but what happened? The economy is humming. The stock market is way up. Gas prices are way down. The unemployment rate has come down. Economic growth is exceeding all of the competitors across the world. There is more to be done. but for us to be successful. we have got to abandon the focus on the wealthy and the well off and pursue middle class economics."
1140012092,I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois for yielding. and of course I want to thank Congresswoman KELLY and Congressman PAYNE for their wonderful leadership in creating this opportunity for members of the Congressional Black Caucus to speak directly to the American people on an issue of great significance. the justice system generally. but specifically. the urgent need to confirm Loretta Lynch as our next Attorney General. Let me say parenthetically that it feels good to be in the presence of my two classmates. R. KELLY and D. PAYNE. I feel like I am in the midst of celebrity. Certainly. they have done a tremendous job in calling us all together. We have got a serious issue that we need this Capitol to confront. In the midst of terrorists who are all across the world who want to strike at our homeland. not only are we dealing with a dynamic where some in the House of Representatives refuse to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security because of an unnecessary obsession with the Presidents executive action on immigrationlet me note. of course. though individuals may differ on its legality. every President since Dwight Eisenhower has taken executive action on immigration. It has occurred 39 times since the 1950s. President Eisenhower did it. President Nixon did it. President Ford did it. President Reagan did it. President George Herbert Walker Bush did it. and President George W. Bush did it. Every President since Eisenhower has taken executive action to provide some form of immigration relief. But. of course. when President Obama steps forward to deal with our Nations current problems. a constitutional crisis has been provoked. What also seems to be interesting. Mr. Speaker. is that the effort to address the issues that some may have with President Obamas executive action has crossed over into trying to stop. delay. and obstruct Loretta Lynch from becoming our Nations next Attorney General. Some over on the Senate side have even said as such: Well. we are concerned that she has got a supportive attitude as it relates to President Obamas executive action. Well. many of my good friends on the other side of the aisle are socalled strict constructionists. They believe in the sanctity of original intent as it relates to the Constitution. Well. the Constitution had an article I legislative branch. an article II executive branch. and an article III judicial branch. And the Founders suggested that if there are issues that need to be worked out. it is the courts job to do it. So there is a lawsuit right now pending in Texas challenging the legality and the constitutionality of the Presidents executive action on immigration. Let the courts do their job. Stop holding hostage our Nations safety and security. and stop holding hostage the confirmation of Loretta Lynch. If you take a look at her resume. no reasonable person could argue that she is not exquisitely qualified. Her resume reads like the American Dream: a Southern girl born in North Carolina. raised by a school librarian mother and a Baptist preacher father. She excelled in her elementary and high school studies so much so that she went off to college at Harvard University and then got a law degree from that same institution. one of the best law schools in the world. She then joined a highpowered litigation law firm in New York. excelled there. but then after several years took. I believe. what was a 75 percent cut in salary and left the private sector so she could go work as a Federal prosecutor and do some good. In that office. she quickly rose through the ranks. tried highprofile cases in the rough and tumble of New York City with grace and with dignity. always making sure that she was guided by the law and the factsnot politics. drama. and hyperbole. Loretta Lynch was confirmed twice. I believe. by the United States Senate unanimously. The American people recognize that this is a Congress that cant agree on basic things. yet unanimously Loretta Lynch has been confirmed twice as the lead prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York. By the way. she is a proud Brooklyn resident now. and I had the honor and privilege of representing Ms. Lynch when I was in the State legislature. She has excelled as the consummate law enforcement professional. She is fair. she is equitable. she is tough. and she is just. So we are here today simply to say it is time to confirm her. The President has made the observation: You cant stand Eric Holder. The easiest way to get rid of him is to confirm Loretta Lynch. What is the hold up? Allow her to take the helm over these final 20 or so months so that we have some stability at the allimportant Department of Justice. We need all hands on deck right now as it relates to the war on terror. We need the FBI. the CIA. the NSA. and the Department of Homeland Security. We have got to be correct 100 percent of the time. Terrorists only have to be right once. It seems to me that if you have a confirmation pending of a clearly qualified individual to head the Department of Justice. the responsible thing to do is to act. and to act now. Mr. Speaker. I just want to thank my good friends R. KELLY and D. PAYNE for giving me this opportunity to spend a few moments on behalf of a tremendous Brooklynite. by way of North Carolina. who is clearly qualified to be our Nations next Attorney General. It is time to bring the confirmation to the floor and to allow her to serve the American people.
1140018301,"I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from New Jersey for her very eloquent and passionate remarks. Mr. Speaker. one of the things that we clearly have to grapple with in this country is the fact that the criminal justice system is broken. and there are many components to that. We have got a situation in which far too often a police officer crosses the line. engages in unlawful conduct. and is not held accountable for that conduct. What kind of incentive does that create for good conduct to take place moving forward if. in the overwhelming majority of instances when police officers cross the line. such as in the Eric Garner case. a grand jury or a local prosecutor will often fail to hold them accountable? The other problem that we have got to address is of overcriminalization in America. of mass incarceration. If you look at some of these encounters that have taken place and that have gone wrong and that have resulted in tragedy. they often have begun with what was. really. overly aggressive. unnecessary policing strategy being deployed to tackle. at best. nuisancelike activity. Eric Garner is dead today because he was selling loose cigarettes. and someone at One Police Plaza gave the order to aggressively police this activity. Crime is down in New York. but there are still a couple hundred homicides committed every year. There is still some gang activity. There are still some assaults taking place. But we want to use police resources to aggressively go after someone who is selling loose. untaxed cigarettes? That is an overcriminalization problem connected to broken windows policing. Walter Scott is dead today because he had a broken taillight. Four children are without a father because Walter Scott had a broken taillight. We have got to evaluate this overly aggressive policing strategy connected to the phenomenon of mass incarceration. I am pleased to have had the opportunity in this Congress to have worked closely with someone who is one of the leaders in the House of Representatives and in the Capitol in dealing with our broken criminal justice system and who works closely with colleagues on the other side of the aisle. like TREY GOWDY and JASON CHAFFETZ and others. who are interested in trying to figure out. collectively. how we can make America a fairer. more efficient place in terms of our criminal justice system. Let me now yield to the distinguished gentleman from the great State of Louisiana. who represents the wonderful city of New Orleans. We refer to him. of course. as the ""franchise"" because of his prolific baseball abilities. but he is also one of the most talented legislators here in the Capitol. I yield to my good friend. the Honorable CEDRIC RICHMOND."
1140044860,Mr. Speaker. this is the final amendment to the bill. which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco was a national tragedy that certainly shocked the conscience of America. We must continue to mourn her passing. We must continue to stand behind her family. We must continue to make sure that her killer is prosecuted to the full extent of the law. but we should not respond with irresponsible public policy. Our Founders indicated that the House of Representatives is supposed to reflect the passions of the people. but the passions should be properly channeled into an appropriate legislative vehicle. On December 14. 2012. 20 children were brutally gunned down in Sandy Hook Elementary School. More than 30.000 additional Americans have died as a result of gun violence since that fateful day. Mr. Speaker. 952 days have passed. This House has done nothing. On June 27. 2013. the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill. 52 Democrats. 14 Republicans. 2 Independents. That bill would have secured our borders. That bill would have reduced the deficit by more than $850 billion over 20 years. That bill would have required undocumented immigrants to learn English. pay back taxes. pass a criminal background check. and then get at the back of the line. Mr. Speaker. 757 days have passed. This House has done nothing. Instead. we are here today considering a misguided legislative response to a terrible tragedy. That is why I offer this amendment. which will prevent the elimination or reduction of funds to State or local law enforcement organizations if the Attorney General determines that the elimination of funding would result in an overall increase in the crime rate. particularly with respect to domestic violence. sex trafficking. and crimes against children. or if it would result in a decrease in the number of trained law enforcement officers on American streets.
1140072253,"it is my honor to stand here today as we undertake an urgent dialogue on how we. as elected Representatives of the people. can work together to end gun violence. I look forward to engaging with Congressman JEFFRIES and our Congressional Black Caucus colleagues in scholarly debate on the issues plaguing African Americans. African American communities. and to develop solutions to the problems our constituents face. As the conscience of the Congress. the Congressional Black Caucus will remain on the forefront of issues that affect Black Americans in particular. and the Nation. in general. For tonight. our anchor. Congressman JEFFRIES. has pointed out the CBC will continue to shed light on the epidemic of gun violence. standing our ground. ending gun violence in America. Mr. Speaker. last week we opened the Second Session of the 114th Congress. Four hundred thirtyfive of us traveled back to Washington ready to serve our constituents and work for the betterment of our Nation. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. whatever spirit of bipartisanship may have been present at the end of 2015 as Republicans and Democrats worked together on key pieces of legislation has disappeared at the precise time our Nation is calling on Congress to pass commonsense legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. We find ourselves confronted with startling statistics that no Nation should endure. Let me just take a moment to share just a few. We know that the impact of gun violence affects every community and every congressional district. However. African American children and teens are 17 times more likely to die from gun homicide than White youth. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While African Americans make up 15 percent of youth in America. African Americans accounted for 45 percent of children and teen gun deaths in 2010. According to Everytown for Gun Safety. 88 Americans die every day from gun violence. Mr. Speaker. Roughly 50 percent of those killed are African American men. who comprise just 6 percent of the population. Homicide is the primary cause of death among African Americans ages 1524. Mr. Speaker. these numbers should be unthinkable. unimaginable. but they are the unfortunate reality in which African American communities live. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King. whose legacy we honor next Monday. he said: We find ourselves ""confronted with the fierce urgency of now."" And Mr. Speaker. it is now that our Nation is in an urgent crisis. yet we are trapped in congressional inaction. Shameful. So our President decided he would not stand by idly while Congress did nothing to prevent another Newtown. another Charleston. other Tucson. With tears in his eyes. he reflected on the senseless killings caused by gun violence over the course of his administration. President Obama announced new executive actions to confront the epidemic of gun violence in America. While mocked by some Republicans for showing emotion at the loss of so many lives. I am here to say I proudly stand with my President on the actions he has taken to prevent gun violence in America. These executive actions will save lives and make the country safer without infringing on lawabiding individuals rights to firearms. You will hear from our colleagues tonight talking about the Presidents actions. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and to address gun violence."
1140081555,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman. Representative BEATTY. from the great State of Ohio for her leadership and for moving us forward throughout the past several weeks as it relates to the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order. this hour of power. It is 60 minutes where we have the opportunity to speak to the American people about issues of importance to our country. to our economy. to the integrity of our democracy as we are doing tonight. It is an honor to share with you today. [ 2045 I also want to acknowledge and thank our colleague. JOHN LARSON from the great State of Connecticut. for his continuing leadership and for taking to the House floor today to highlight both the historic significance of the speech that President Johnson gave from this very Chamber 51 years ago. on March 15. 1965. about voting in America and ensuring that every single person. regardless of their race or their color or their background had an opportunity to exercise their franchise. and to point out to the American people that the Congress will pause tomorrow to honor two true American legends. Representative LEWIS and Representative JOHNSON. who served the American people before they arrived in the peoples House and through their service here in the House of Representatives. It is with great humility that I stand today to address a topic that I think is of particular significance at this moment in time that we face in America in terms of the turmoil that many may be feeling. watching. undergoing: the economic changes that have been experienced over the last few decades. We know that the middle class. in many ways. has been left behind. Wages have remained stagnant. notwithstanding the increased productivity of the American people over the last 40plus years. When the economy collapsed. many highincome earners were able to rebound in no small part as a result of the bailout that occurred. There are a lot of Americans who are still hoping. looking out for their opportunity to be brought back into the economic mainstream by the people they have sent to Congress to represent them. Notwithstanding all of the challenges that we have to confront. whether that is our broken criminal justice system or the economy that has still not completely recovered. we have made substantial progress under the leadership of Barack Obama. But of course there is more that needs to be done. and we could welcome some cooperation from folks on the other side of the aisle because all of our constituents were hit hard in 2008. yet President Obama has largely been left to his own devices. Notwithstanding all of these issues. central to how our government works is the fact that it is designed to be a government of the people. by the people. and for the people. Abraham Lincoln. of course. famously uttered those words in his Gettysburg Address. If we are going to have that type of government. then everybody needs the opportunity to be able to participate in choosing their representatives in government without obstacle or obstruction. We understand this is a great country. but it is also a country that has had a stain on its history as it relates to denying some the opportunity to participate fully in American democracy. That is the reason. after all. that. in the aftermath of the Civil War that threatened to tear this country apart. we had a Reconstruction amendment related to slavery and then a Reconstruction amendment related to the equal protection under the law and due process for all Americans. and lastly. of course. with the 15th Amendment designed to make sure that. in the Constitution. racial discrimination. as it relates to the exercise of the franchise. would be prohibited. But. unfortunately. notwithstanding the 15th Amendment being ratified and put into our Constitution. more than 100 years would pass by until this country really confronted the denial of the right to vote in a meaningful way. particularly in the Deep South. and it happened because of the efforts and sacrifice of a great many people: Dr. Martin Luther King. JOHN LEWIS. Andrew Young. the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. the NAACP. and those foot soldiers who were on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7. 1965. and almost lost their lives when they were attacked without provocation by Alabama State troopers as they endeavored to cross that bridge on the way from Selma to Montgomery. That. of course. then prompted President Johnson to deliver that address. where he so famously uttered the words upon his conclusion that ""we shall overcome."" The 1965 Voting Rights Act continues to be the most significant piece of civil rights legislation ever passed by this Congress. but unfortunately we know that it is currently under attack. It is under attack because the Supreme Court effectively. in the Shelby v. Holder case. eviscerated its impact by striking down section 4. socalled coverage clause. which effectively eliminated the Department of Justices ability to require States with a history of voting rights discrimination to have to preclear any changes that it makes. Now. what I have been struggling to figure out during my brief time here in the Congress is why voting rights has become such a controversial thing when. it seems to me. it is so central to the integrity of our democracy. For decades. in the aftermath of the passage of the Voting Rights Act. it was actually pretty bipartisan. this notion that in order for our democracy to work there should be no artificial obstacles erected to prevent peopleAfrican Americans. Latinos. immigrant families. and othersfrom being able to participate in what basically makes America great. what makes us unique: the ability to elect our representatives and for there to be peaceful transitions of power regardless of ideology. regardless of your region. regardless of what State a President may come from in order to keep the Republic going. When you look at the history of the Voting Rights Act. as I indicated. it has largely been. until recently. a bipartisan endeavor. In fact. every time the Voting Rights Act was reauthorizedand it has happened four timesnot only did it pass with bipartisan majorities in the Congress. but it was signed into law each and every time by a Republican President. In 1970. Richard Nixon signed into law the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. In 1975. Gerald Ford signed into law the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. In 1982. President Ronald Reagan signed into law the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Then in 2006. President George W. Bush signed into law the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. This significant piece of civil rights legislation was enacted into law and then reenacted on every single occasion with the signature of a Republican President. indicating that voting. participation in the franchise. having the American people in their full. gorgeous mosaic elect their representatives is an American thing. But all of a sudden. it has become controversial. Now. I dont know if the timing of the election of our current President has anything to do with that. Historians will make that analysis as they move forward. It is above my pay grade. I just find it interesting that this notion of voter fraud. which was always a fiction put forth by the defenders of the racebased Southern hierarchy to deny African Americans the right to voteand was not an issue when Richard Nixon was elected. it wasnt an issue when Reagan was elected. it wasnt an issue when George Herbert Walker Bush was elected. it wasnt an issue when George W. Bush was elected. notwithstanding the fact that I am still not convinced he won the State of Floridaall of a sudden. in the aftermath of the election of President Barack Obama. apparently there has been an outbreak of this fever that we have got to deal with socalled voter fraud. No evidence of the fraud. not a scintilla of evidence has been produced by a single proponent of this argument. but when people were elected in 2010. in the immediate aftermath of that election during President Barack Obamas first term. more than 180 different pieces of legislation in 41 States were introduced. all. in the opinion of many objective observers. designed to suppress the right to vote. And at the same time. this challenge was working its way through the Supreme Court from. of all groups of people. Shelby. Alabama. Now. the irony of that. JOHN LEWIS almost lost his life. as Representative LARSON indicated. on the Edmund Pettus Bridge down in Selma. Alabama. and yet the Supreme Court. in a 54 decision. in a case brought by the folks from Shelby County. apparently thinking that they were victims because of the oppressive nature of the preclearance provision. the Supreme Court. at least for the time being. bought that argument. So we find ourselves now in a situation here in the Congress where the Court has said to us: Fix it. update the coverage formula. So bipartisan legislation has been introduced. championed by folks like JIM SENSENBRENNER. the author of the 2006 reauthorization and a very distinguished and respected former Republican chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary. and. of course. JOHN CON-"
1140081561,Well. it is a great question. I look at it in two ways. First. when you think about mass incarceration as a phenomenon. one that. hopefully. in this Congress we will be able to do something about. in recognition of the fact that America imprisons more people than any other country in the world. increasingly. we have become a country that overincarcerates and undereducates. As a result. we have lost generations of young people. disproportionately. African Americans and Latinos. In 1971. President Richard Nixon declared publicly that drug abuse was public enemy number one. At the time. there were less than 350.000 people incarcerated in America. That was the starting point of the war on drugs. More than 40 years later we have now got 2.3 million people incarcerated in America. A significant number of those folksapproximately 50 percent at the Federal level and similar numbers at the State levelare there for nonviolent drug offenses. Yet. every single one of those people who have been incarcerated in America has lost the right to vote. some permanently. some temporarily with an opportunity to perhaps recover it. More than a million people are currently incarcerated from the African American community. So our system is broken. Our democracy is in need of adjustment. If there is not an understanding that the absence of refraining from participating in that democracy through exercising the franchise yields consequences that public policymakers will choose either intentionally or through benign neglect to allow things like mass incarceration to overwhelm a community. then we are going to continue to see things happen that are not in the best interest of America. Certainly. electoral participation matters to the African American community. The other thing that we have got to look at in the context of the right to voteand there is some bipartisan support because Senator RAND PAUL on the other side of the Capitol has been very visionary in this regardis that disenfranchising people who have been incarcerated in America. paid their debt to society. have moved on with their lifebut to permanently restrict them. even in some cases when the conviction is for a misdemeanor offense. is unAmerican. But some have used this type of disenfranchisement related to the prison industrial complex to overwhelm many communities because of mass incarceration to. again. set up obstacles to full participation in American democracy. So we have got to put everything on the table in terms of our effort to fix our broken criminal justice system. which I am pleased. to date. at least in the House on the Judiciary Committee. has been bipartisan in nature. But we have to take an expansive approach to repairing the damage that has been done over more than 40 years of a failed war on drugs. with millions upon millions upon millions of people stamped with a criminal record. I believe in excess of 65 million people during that time period. disproportionately African Americans and Latinos. It is one of many issues that is on the table that. hopefully. will result in folks understanding that the stakes are high as it relates to who represents you. And the vehicle is just to participate. That is the great majesty of our democracy as it was conceived by the Founders and those who came after: Government of the people. by the people. and for the people. through electoral participation.
1140086182,remind us. A concurrent resolution on the budget means it is supposed to pass both the Senate and the House. again. by April 15. At this date. neither Chamber has considered a budget resolution for 2017. Madam Speaker. I dont know about your constituents. but in my district. Ohios Third Congressional District. my constituents expect Congress to work. so lets take a look at it. What happens when people refuse to do their jobs? If postal workers dont deliver. you dont get your mail. If farmers dont farm. people dont eat. If teachers dont show up. our children dont learn. People all over America take their jobs seriously. and they expect us. as their elected officials. to also do that. It is time for House Republicans to get America off the road to ruin and back on the path to prosperity. When Speaker RYAN took officethis is worth repeating. and Congressman JEFFRIES mentioned this earlier. When Speaker RYAN took office. House Republicans stated that passing a budget was a basic function of government. However. the statutory deadline of passing a budget resolution by April 15 has come and gone. although House Republicans made passing a budget a top priority for this year. In the Republicans own words. they cant even accomplish the basic functions of governmenttheir job. Madam Speaker. why do we care that we dont have a budget? Let me give you the answer. The importance of setting a budget is that it lays out the blueprint for the appropriations process. It outlines government spending for the year. Without a budget. we have 12 appropriations bills that are working their way through Congress without there being guiding principles on overall spending. If we cannot as a Congress perform the basic functions of governing. how are we going to tackle the much more complicated issues. such as income inequality. education quality. tuition affordability. tax reform. and so many others? Once again. House Republicans have demonstrated the degree to which the sharp division within their Conference is impeding Congress ability to work for the American people. Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hardworking American families. they have just decided not to pass a budget. This decision was made despite the fact that President Obama submitted his budget request to Congress back in February. As you may remember. Madam Speaker. the Republican majority here in the House of Representatives and the Republicancontrolled Senate took the unprecedented step of refusing to receive the OMB Director for a formal hearing so as to present the Presidents budget. Madam Speaker. how did that turn out for us? We all know how it turned out. The Republican Conference failed the American people. and it set us on a road to ruin by not passing a budget.

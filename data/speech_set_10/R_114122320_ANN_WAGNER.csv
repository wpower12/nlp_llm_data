1140004937,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of packages of human trafficking legislation to be considered by the House of Representatives this week. 12 different pieces of legislation. I also rise today in support of all the good work done by my colleagues here in Congress on the issue of human trafficking. Mr. Speaker. as a former United States Ambassador. I was exposed firsthand to the horrors of human trafficking on an international level. I witnessed and reported on devastating consequences of human trafficking. where innocent women and children were dragged into the dark abyss of sex slavery. But never in my wildest dreams did I ever think human trafficking was so rampant right here in the United States of America. Americans are being forced into sexual slavery by ruthless human traffickers. Mr. Speaker. right now there are young women being forced into prostitution in virtually every district across this Nation. It is hiding in plain sight. In fact. I was shocked to learn that my own hometown of St. Louis. Missouri. has been identified as one of the top 20 areas for sex trafficking in the United States. Mr. Speaker. this problem is before our eyes. It is in our communities. it is in our neighborhoods. and it is in our culdesacs. It is right here before us. Every year. thousands of young Americans lives are impacted by this despicable crime. However. there is hope. I take hope from the work done by the law enforcement professionals who are on the front lines every day protecting our Nations children from those who would seek to exploit them. I take hope from those who work in victims services and their tireless efforts to help survivors recover. heal. and forge new lives out of the horrors of sexual enslavement. Most importantly. Mr. Speaker. I take hope from all the survivors. the survivors of this hideous crime. Their strength gives us strength. their resolve gives us inspiration. and their steadfast commitment to ending sex trafficking gives us all the courage to fight. Mr. Speaker. because of the efforts of many individuals and groups. I am happy to report that Congress has taken notice of this serious problem. Years of work by Representatives
1140026755,I thank the chairman very much for his leadership on this issue and so many others. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of S. 178. the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. and all of the Housepassed human trafficking legislation that was incorporated into this Senate bill. Mr. Speaker. today marks the culmination of a long journey for myself and many Members in both Chambers who have worked on this important issue. This legislation represents a significant step forward in the Federal Governments efforts to combat the scourge of modernday slavery. known as human trafficking. This bill makes enormous progress in the fight against trafficking by providing resources to law enforcement officials and collecting fees from sex traffickers that go into a new fund for victims. It also includes my signature legislation. the SAVE Act. which make it illegal to knowingly advertise the victims of human trafficking. especially on the Internet. I thank my friends and colleagues. Senator MARK KIRK and DIANNE FEINSTEIN. for offering the SAVE Act as an amendment to this very important legislation. Beyond the multiple tools and resources it gives to law enforcement and survivors. this legislation also serves an important symbolic purpose. This bill symbolizes the longstanding and steadfast commitment that Members of Congress have towards protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. No longer will the cruel exploitation of women and children be allowed to continue unchecked. No longer will sexual predators be allowed to torture. rape. and kill young Americans in the name of financial profit. Mr. Speaker. with this legislation. we are providing voice to the voiceless and advocating for those who cannot advocate for themselves. Mr. Speaker. I am so proud of all of the good. bipartisan work done by my colleagues here in Congress on this issue of human trafficking. Years of work by many of my colleagues. including Representatives POE. SMITH. NOEM. PAULSEN. BEATTY. MALONEY. and many. many others. Mr. Speaker. have laid the foundation for this long overdue action. I am grateful that many of my colleagues have held events in their home districts to raise awareness and educate the public about human trafficking. Awareness. training. and education are the key to preventing this horrible crime from happening in the first place. Young people must be warned about the devious and manipulative strategies employed by traffickers to ensnare them in the trap of sexual slavery. The children at risk are not just school students. Pimps or traffickers are known to prey on victims as young as 9 years old. Traffickers may target minor victims through social media Web sites. afterschool programs. shopping malls and clubs. and through friends or acquaintances who recruit students on school campuses. One of the best ways to combat human trafficking is through education. Many States have successful programs that train school personnel about how to identify the victims. We should work with schools to develop policies and protocols and partnerships to address and prevent the exploitation of children. Partnership between public and private sectors is the key to combating human trafficking. Many times. frontline employees in the transportation and hospitality industry are the ones best suited to identify trafficking victims or their predators. Increased awareness and training will lead to more victims being identified. which is the critical step in breaking the cycle of exploitation and victimization. Mr. Speaker. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation and all efforts to combat human trafficking. and I look forward to continuing this work in the House of Representatives. and this Congress as a whole. for years to come.
1140042044,"Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague. Mr. HURT. for yielding. I am glad that the House is taking up H.R. 1723. the Small Company Simple Registration Act. which will take a muchneeded step in helping remove financial barriers and make it more efficient for small businesses to go public. This bipartisan legislation. which I have sponsored with Ms. TERRI SEWELL from Alabama and which was approved by the House Financial Services Committee on a completely unanimous vote of 600. would make a simple change in the basic registration form for new securities offerings. the form S1. Specifically. it would allow smaller reporting companies to incorporate by reference any documents filed with the SEC after the effective date. which means that those companies will not have to go through the trouble of refiling the form S1 again and again. This will have a profound impact on these small companies by cutting compliance costs. as they will not have to file redundant paperwork and wait on the SEC to approve their filing in order to raise capital and grow their small business. Small companies are increasingly leading the way in terms of technological innovation and job creation but consistently struggle with finding adequate access to capital in order to grow their business. It is a fact that small businesses are the main driver of economic growth in our country. as they create more jobs than any other business sector in America. In fact. the Kauffman Foundation. which is a nonprofit economic resource organization based in Kansas City. Missouri. estimated in 2010 that startups create an average of 3 million jobs annually and stated: ""Without startups. there would be no net job growth in the U.S. economy."" It is clear that we must empower small businesses with every avenue to grow and. therefore. create jobs. For many small businesses looking to take the next step in expanding. going public is an attractive option that grants them access to the capital markets and allows them to issue stock to a wider range of investors. However. the ""price of admission"" for this avenue to raising capital is continually increasing through the amount of compliance and red tape required. For many. it simply is not worth it. Indeed. our securities laws are structured today in a way that favors large companies over small startups. which are struggling to gain market share. by increasingly requiring more legal compliance and providing exemptions for companies over certain revenue thresholds."
1140051212,Madam Speaker. today I speak in support of H.R. 3134. the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015. to terminate taxpayer support of this deplorable organization. Id like to thank my good friend. Congresswoman DIANE BLACK for her leadership on this issue and her unwavering support for the lives of the unborn. This summer. we have learned of the shocking nature of Planned Parenthoods practice of selling babies hearts. lungs. livers. brains and other organs. often for a profit. to the highest bidder. We were disturbed by what we learned about these practices. but perhaps even more so by the cold indifference in which countless employees dehumanized unborn children. effectively turning them into line item revenue sources. rather than human life in its most precious form. After discovering the grotesque nature of these practices. the U.S. House of Representatives responded to these abhorrent activities by launching investigative hearings. the first of which began in the House Judiciary Committee last week. Yet the very same week we began investigating the extent of the wrongdoing. the Executive Branch. through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. awarded Planned Parenthood of Missouri. Iowa and Montana with over $1 million in taxpayer support. The only response to this unthinkable action is for the U.S. House of Representatives. the legislative body with constitutional authority over federal funds. to pass legislation expressly prohibiting the federal government from supporting Planned Parenthood. Madam Speaker. it is not enough for the U.S. House of Representatives to deny funds from a single continuing resolution or omnibus spending package. Instead we must do so permanently and Congresswoman BLACKs legislation gives Congress an opportunity to continue our investigations into Planned Parenthood and work toward the day when we are no longer funding this abhorrent organization. In the short term. there is much work to be done. The U.S. House of Representatives is responsible for acting on behalf of the American people and investigating the extent to which Planned Parenthoods has profited from this activity. Furthermore we must make sure that Planned Parenthood has not been engaging in illegal partial birth abortions. We must determine whether or not Planned Parenthood has been breaking the law by altering abortion procedures to preserve certain organs for sale. We must protect women and unborn children from these dangerous procedures that are designed to increase revenue for this group and profit from the destruction innocent life. And perhaps most importantly. we must provide funding for other organizations that provide womens health care support and serviceswithout also offering abortions. And we must not continue taxpayer funding for groups like Planned Parenthood that believe they are above the laws of the United States. We have a duty. as elected Representatives to stand up for the most vulnerable among us. to lend a voice to the voiceless. and fight back against injustice. And so I lend my full support to H.R. 3134. so that we may defund Planned Parenthood and provide vulnerable women with better options for their health care needs.
1140051799,"Mr. Speaker. today I rise in honor of an American hero. On March 16. 2006. Missouris Second Congressional District lost a brave young soldier when United States Army Sergeant Amanda N. Pinson was killed in a mortar attack while serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom. I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this courageous young woman. Army Sergeant Amanda Pinson was a signals intelligence analyst assigned to the 101st Military Intelligence Detachment of the 101st Airborne Division. based in Fort Campbell. Kentucky. The Screaming Eagles are personal to me. My oldest son. Raymond. is presently serving as a captain in the 101st Airborne. Growing up in Lemay. Missouri. Amanda enlisted in the Army after graduating from Hancock Place High School. where she won several scholarships and was on the basketball and softball teams. Amanda was always concerned with helping others. In high school. she started her own group called the Hancock Environmental Leadership Program. and she enlisted all of her friends to join her in making a difference. Amanda and her group of dedicated volunteers planted trees at local parks and volunteered with local seniors. The group also planted and maintained flowers at the entrance of Jefferson Barracks Park. The park where she used to plant flowers is adjoined to Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery. where Amanda was laid to rest. A pink willow tree was also planted in her honor at her alma mater. Hancock High School. in 2006. Amanda clearly had the respect and the admiration of her fellow soldiers. She was described as a ""model soldier"" and ""a breath of fresh air"" by Lieutenant Colonel Lucinda Lane. who spoke at her service. Following her death. Sergeant Pinson was awarded a Bronze Star. a Good Conduct Medal. a Global War on Terrorism Medal. and a Purple Heart. Her impact on the people privileged to know her is evidenced by the several memorials that honor her life. In 2006. the U.S. Army honored Amanda by dedicating the building where she worked in Tikrit. Iraq. naming it Pinson Hall. Amanda is survived by her mother. Chris. her father. Tony. and her younger brother. Bryan. The Sgt. Amanda M. Pinson Post Office will join the other memorials in her honor as a testament to the bravery. valor. and kindness of this American hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for her country. It is my honor to sponsor H.R. 323. a bill that names the Affton Branch. Grasso Plaza Post Office after such a courageous young woman. immortalizing a hero who gave up her life in service to the Nation that she loved. May it bring comfort to her family and their friends and give witness to Sergeant Pinsons bravery and sacrifice. To quote the face that adorns so many tributes and memorials to Amanda: ""If love could have saved you. you would have lived forever."" So today on behalf of a grateful nation. I say: Thank you. Amanda. You are indeed loved."
1140051808,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman very. very much for his indulgence in these three post office namings. I thank the ranking member. also. Mr. Speaker. today I rise in honor of a brave young man from Missouris Second Congressional District. On June 23. 2007. Missouris Second Congressional District lost a true American hero when United States Army First Lieutenant Daniel Riordan made the ultimate sacrifice for his country while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Mr. Speaker. I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this young patriot. Daniel Patrick Riordan was born to Rick and Jeanine Riordan on February 17. 1983. He had a twin brother. Nick. and an older sister. Suzanne. After graduating from Vianney High School in Kirkwood. Missouri. Dan attended Southeast Missouri State. where he was in the Air Forces ROTC program. After graduation. Dan decided to follow his father into the military and joined the U.S. Army. quickly becoming known as Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant Dan became a tank commander. and in 2006 he was deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As a member of Demon Company in the 1st Cavalry Division. Dan served with courage and determination. Despite frequently being outnumbered in enemy territory. Dan was always out on point. leading his platoon into battle. Dan took his leadership responsibilities literally. As he put it: How can I order my men forward if I am not willing to go first? To those who knew Dan. his devotion to his country through service and sacrifice came as no surprise. He was both a fierce and dedicated warrior in the service of our country and a caring and loving gentleman who felt a duty to help those in need. From a very young age. Dan showed sensitivity beyond his years. At the age of 5 or 6. while attending a funeral. Dans mom found him sitting with an elderly woman. When she asked him why he was sitting with her. he said she looked sad and lonely. It was this kind of compassion that drew him to the United States military: his desire to serve. help. and protect those in need. While at home on leave from Operation Iraqi Freedom. Dan consistently reassured his family that our countrys military efforts were truly bringing empowerment and freedom to the people of Iraq. He believed in a cause greater than himself. that of freedom. democracy. and the dignity of all people. While in the Army. Dan wrote his mother a letter in case he didnt return. One thing that he said was: Dont mourn for me. Mom. Celebrate my life. Today we celebrate First Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordans life by designating the Sappington Branch Post Office in St. Louis. Missouri. as the Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan Post Office. The United States of America owes Dan a priceless debt that we will never be able to fully repay. but we can do our part to ensure that his memory lives on. Therefore. it is my honor to sponsor H.R. 324. a bill that names the Sappington Branch Post Office after such a courageous young man. immortalizing a hero who gave up his life in the service to the Nation that he loved. This legislation will serve as a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of First Lieutenant Daniel Riordan. standing as a physical reminder of the bravery of one American from Missouris Second Congressional District.
1140070933,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of life and in firm opposition to Planned Parenthoods unconscionable activities. But as I begin my remarks. I want to be very clear about one thing. The vote that the House will take today is a victory for womens health while also serving as a cry to end the monstrous actions of an organization that continually attacks our most vulnerable unborn children. There are more than 13.500 publicly supported alternatives for womens health care in the country and 588 in Missourialternatives that treat women without performing abortions. alternatives that will have more access to Federal money for womens health care. This means that in Missouri alone. there are 45 health clinics for every Planned Parenthood clinic in the State. So. please. please dont be distracted by political rhetoric. We are strengthening our support for womens health. and we are stripping Federal taxpayer dollars from an organization that performs more than 327.000 abortions a year. While I have long fought to stop this atrocious practice. I was especially shocked this summer by videos of Planned Parenthoods cold indifference and barbaric murder of the societys most vulnerable members. It is our duty as lawmakers. as citizens of a great nation. as friends. as neighbors. as family members to protect those who cannot protect themselves. It is a tragic shame to watch employees of Planned Parenthood so willing to sell the body parts of unborn babies. These are truly some of the most horrifying and heartbreaking videos I have ever seen. even throughout all my work in combating sex trafficking. sexual assault. and abuse. The United States is a nation that seeks to protect the least among us in numerous ways. from medical research assistance for the needy to elderly care. It is time that we do the same for our precious unborn children. Mr. Speaker. today is an historic day when we will finally stop taxpayer dollars from funding Planned Parenthoods abortions. Surely. no Member of Congress can. in good conscience. claim that we should fund these heinous activities with your hardearned dollars. After seeing these horrible videos. I was compelled to take action. I joined Congressman SEAN DUFFY and Congressman CHRIS SMITH in sending a letter to Chairmen UPTON and GOODLATTE. requesting an immediate investigation into Planned Parenthoods actions. I would like to thank House leadership and the committee chairmen for granting our request and for the work that they have done on their committees already. Planned Parenthood has shamelessly tried to defend the indefensible before these committees. They have shown no remorse for the actions described in these videos. apologizing only for the tone of them. In response. they have effectively dared Congress to act. And today we do. Today Congress says enough is enough. Today we pass legislation that will give the President a very stark choice: continue paying for acts that are so disturbing. so horrifying. and so disgusting that they require congressional investigation. or simply respect life and respect the taxpayers hardearned dollars. Mr. Speaker. the heart of my teams mission statement. which currently hangs in my office. reads: To confront injustice and serve as a voice for the most vulnerable in our society. Defunding Planned Parenthood is the right thing to do. Today I will give voice to the voiceless. I will proudly cast my vote for life. for these innocent angels. I will continue to fight for the day when abortion is not only illegal. but is unthinkable.
1140073966,I thank the gentlemen for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 515. the International Megans Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking. I would like to thank. like so many have. Congressman CHRIS SMITH for introducing this important legislation to protect innocent children from the evils of sexual predators in the United States and worldwide. As a mother who raised three beautiful children. I can tell you that the constant concern for their safety and protection never goes away. When they were young. I worried if they were safe at the playground down the street. if they were safe at the shopping mall or movie theater. Named after a young girl who was kidnapped. raped. and murdered at just 7 years old by her neighbor. Megans Law and public knowledge of predators in our communities have been critical tools in protecting our children and easing some of the many fears that parents feel every single day. I cannot fathom the anger and anguish felt by Megans parents and all parents whose children fall prey to such sick predators. I would do anything to protect my children and all children from sexual predators. and I feel blessed that I and my colleagues are in a position where we can make a difference. We will be able to better identify and scrutinize sex offenders activity. ensuring that they do not engage in the ghastly practice of sex tourism either in our own neighborhood or any neighborhood around the world. The U.S. must take a leading role as a global defender of children from sexual abuse. Often planning their trips around locations where the most vulnerable children can be found. sex offenders should not be allowed to use the anonymity provided by foreign travel to help hide their hideous crimes. A 2010 Government Accountability Office report showed that in a single year. at least 4.500 registered sex offenders received U.S. passports to travel internationally. This is absolutely unacceptable. Mr. Speaker. During my time as a United States ambassador. I was exposed firsthand to the horrors of sexual abuse and human trafficking on the international level.
1140111677,Mr. Chair. I thank the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. I am proud to sponsor the Accelerating Access to Capital Act. H.R. 2357. I would also like to thank and congratulate my colleagues. Representative EMMER and Chairman GARRETT. for their legislation as well. Regulatory burden is one of the reasons why we are still in the slowest recovery of our lifetime since the financial crisis. Small businesses are finding it more and more difficult to find financing in order to grow and expand their business. DoddFrank has made traditional bank lending for small businesses more scarce. Smaller companies that wish to go to the capital markets are finding compliance and regulatory requirements too extensive and far too costly. This legislation builds upon other efforts by this committee to provide simplified disclosure and reduce burdens for smaller companies in order to lower the cost of raising capital. Specifically. this would extend to smaller reporting companies the ability to utilize Form S3. a much more simplified registration for companies that have already met prior reporting requirements with the SEC. Allowing small companies to use this form would provide significant benefits with its shorter length. allowing forward incorporation by reference and the ability to offer securities off the shelf. which are all things that larger companies are currently able to enjoy. Streamlining disclosure will lower compliance costs associated with filing redundant paperwork. which will in turn allow companies to direct more resources to growing their business. Fuel Performance Solutions. which is a fantastic company based in my hometown of St. Louis. has spent the last 10 years working on exciting fuel products that could potentially save Americans money at the pump and reduce harmful emissions. In order to fund this research in breakthrough technology. Fuel Performance Solutions eventually decided to register with the SEC and go public to raise more capital and expand their business. The company conducted a study. Mr. Chair. and found that. instead of filling out a 100page registration form which takes about 4 to 6 weeks to complete. this legislation would allow them to fill out a 20page form which only takes 2 days to complete. As a result. they would have incurred less legal fees. less accounting. and less investment banking fees and saved close to $225.000. Additionally. under this job growth legislation. they could have received SEC approval in days. rather than months. and thereby obtain certainty in regard to funding their business. I am proud that the greater Metropolitan St. Louis region is the fastest growing startup scene in the country. But we must provide opportunities for these businesses and many others to grow and drive and thrive in the marketplace. Extending these costsaving provisions to smaller companies that large companies are currently able to enjoy is absolutely critical and can make the difference in their ability to issue an additional offering. expand their business. and create more jobs. The Accelerating Access to Capital Act will do just that. I urge the passage of this legislation.

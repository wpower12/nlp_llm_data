1130008721,Mr. Speaker. 1.636. thats how many days it has been since the application to build the Keystone XL pipeline was filed. It took Canada just 7 months to approve the pipeline. President Obama has taken 41/2 years. Study after study has shown that not only is the pipeline safe. but it will provide a means of transporting oil that is safer than using trains or trucks. It is also environmentally safe. In fact. when compared to other means of transportation. it is perhaps the most environmentally friendly way to transport oil across our country. It will create thousands of jobsat least 800 in my home State of Montanaand he still wont make a decision. Earlier this month. the U.S. State Department issued its Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL Presidential permit application. which confirmed what we already knew. The Keystone XL pipeline will have no significant impacts on the environment. In fact. this is the fourth environmental review of the Keystone pipelinewith a final report still to comeeven though report after report has stated that the pipeline will not have significant environmental effects. This report also comes after Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman approved a new route through his State for the Keystone XL pipeline project. Just this past January. I joined 150 other House Members in calling on President Obama to quickly approve the permits for Keystone in light of this new route. That was two months ago. and we have yet to hear anything back from the President. As a member of the House Energy Action Team. I understand how important this project is to our Nation and to my home State of Montana. Let me be clearthis project means jobs for Montanans. This project could directly create more than 800 goodpaying jobs in Montana and thousands more across the Nation. It means coming one step closer to North American energy independence. The Keystone XL would be able to move up to 830.000 barrels of oil per day. That is about half the amount that the U.S. presently imports from the Middle East. And of the oil moved each day. 100.000 barrels will come from the Bakken formation. which spreads across Montana and North Dakota. This isnt about politics. Republicans and Democrats alike support the pipeline. This is about our Nations security. This is about lowering energy costs for American families. This is about American jobs. Enough is enough. We cant afford to wait any longer. It has been 1.636 days. Its time for President Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.
1130020900,I thank my good friend from Indiana. Congressman LUKE MESSER. for organizing this Special Order in preparation for Thursdays vote to repeal the Presidents health care law. Earlier today I emailed my constituents a quick survey back home in Montana with one simple question: Do you support efforts to repeal President Obamas health care law? Weve seen already overwhelming response to our office here tonight from Montanans across our State. combined with letters. emails. the phone calls weve received. by three to one. Montanans want to repeal ObamaCare. Last week I had a teletownhall meeting so I could hear from the people of Montana about the issues that matter most to them. The last question I was asked at the very end of this hourlong teletownhall was from a woman from Florence. Montana. a small town on the western side of our State. She shared her heartfelt concerns about the health care law and how it was going to affect her small business. Between the costly new rules and regulations and rising health insurance premiums. she didnt know how she would be able to follow the law and keep her business afloat. And these challenges arent unique to this one small business owner from Montana. Families and small businesses across America are struggling under President Obamas health care overhaul. Rather than providing real solutions to increase access to affordable care. ObamaCare is driving costs up. its hurting small businesses. its raising taxes on Americans by more than $1 trillion over the next decade and. ultimately. puts the government directly between patients and their doctors. This law also hurts our seniors and their access to health care. The Presidents health care law took more than $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for new ObamaCare spending. and establishes IPAB. this unaccountable. unelected board of bureaucrats empowered to further undermine seniors access to medical care. And following this weeks troubling news from the IRS. it makes it very clear that the IRS should not be in charge of enforcing ObamaCares core provisions. We need to repeal ObamaCare to strip them of this authority. Furthermore. the Presidents health care overhaul sets in motion serious violations of Americas religious freedoms. Under ObamaCare. the Department of Health and Human Services has mandated health care coverage of products and services to which some Americans are morally opposed. Under this mandate. religious institutions and employers. as well as health care providers who hold religious and moral convictions. are stripped of their religious freedoms. This is a clear violation of Americans First Amendment rights. and it is of critical importance that the religious and moral convictions held by many Americans are protected. Thats why I recently joined more than 90 of my colleagues here in the House in calling for the upcoming House appropriations proposals to contain full protections for Americans religious liberties and conscience rights by including provisions found in the Health Care Conscience Rights Act. which I helped introduce in March. But we must continue fighting to repeal this failed law in its entirety. We know that our health care system is complex. it has major problems that need to be addressed. But ObamaCare only makes the matters worse. The Presidents health care law takes us in the wrong direction. At the end of the day. it will result in higher costs. higher premiums. and force millions of Americans to lose the coverage they currently have. And lets just remember something from 3 years ago. Remember in March of 2010. when ObamaCare passed the House. there was nothing bipartisan about ObamaCare. There was bipartisan opposition. In fact. 34 Democrats joined 178 Republicans in opposing ObamaCare. but not one single Republican voted for this. Theres nothing bipartisan about it. other than bipartisan opposition. I will vote to repeal this law on Thursday. I will continue to work with my colleagues in support of better. more effective solutions that give Americans the quality. affordable care they deserve.
1130021494,"Thanks much to my good friend from Kentucky. Mr. THOMAS MASSIE. for coordinating this Special Order here tonight. I appreciate it greatly. Were here tonight to share our strong opposition to the socalled Marketplace Fairness Act. This is a bill that mandates small businesses to collect sales tax on behalf of other cities and States when selling products over the Internet. The problem is this bill would fundamentally change how online purchases are taxed and would impose yet another burden on small businesses across the country. but especially like my home State of Montana. You see. in Montana we dont have a statewide sales tax. In fact. we often say you know youre a native Montanan if you voted against a sales tax twice. But I will have to say that in my home State we have a balanced budget requirement. And not only did our State balance its budget this year. were running a surplus. and weve done that without a sales tax. And Washington should do the same. They should learn how to balance their budget. and they dont have to impose a sales tax thats imposed on businesses across this country. But even though we dont have a sales tax. under this legislation. Montana small businesses would be forced to collect sales taxes for up to 9.600 cities and States. none of which would go back to the people of Montana. Let me be clear. This isnt just a bill that hurts no sales tax States like Montana. It hurts small businesses in every State. burdening businesses that depend on Internet sales with added costs and more paperwork and more regulations. Proponents of this bill say. well. its about fairness. They say that this bill will help prevent the supposedly widespread practice of ""showrooming."" where customers visit a physical store but then buy the goods online where customers can get a better price or avoid paying sales tax. According to proponents of this bill. this showrooming is destroying our brickandmortar businesses. Well. ladies and gentlemen. this is not only misleading. its wrong. As the National Journal reported. a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of 10.000 shoppers found this socalled widespread problem occurred less than 2 percent of the time. In fact. the survey found that 10 times as many consumers researched products online so they could go buy them at the local brickandmortar shop. Think about that. And weve all had that happen to us. You may go online and shop. but you may not want to pay the shipping costs. You may not want to have the time it takes to receive the goods. You may want to be buying that bike for your child. so you go downtown and buy at the brickandmortar store. Furthermore. the study states. and I quote. ""We also cant emphasize enough that the physical store remains the centerpiece of the purchase journey for many categories. In 9 out of 11 categories. in fact. the majority of consumers use physical stores for both researching and purchasing the products they want to buy."" I know that many times Id rather head downtown to my home of Bozeman. Montana. to talk to folks facetoface and purchase a product Ive researched online so I can avoid shipping fees and avoid the wait time. I know a lot of Montanans feel the same way. But then I also have to ask. what is fair about forcing a small business that relies on Internet sales to learn the ins and outs of 9.600 different tax jurisdictions or be subjected to tax audits. as the gentleman from Kentucky just mentioned. not just from one State but from all 46 States that collect sales tax? Imposing these unreasonable standards on online retail sales but not also on brick- andmortar retail stores is not only unfair. its unworkable. Ive heard from Montanas small businessowners who are deeply concerned about what this bill means for them and how it will affect their ability to remain profitable. Im concerned too. Ive spent nearly three decades in the private sector. In fact. prior to having served in Congress. the last elective office I held was student body president in high school. So Ive come from the business world. Ive been a job creator and somebody thats had to fight the regulations and pay taxes. I know that if youre a small business owner and youre forced to comply with more than 9.000 different tax codes. which. by the way. most small businessowners readily admit its next to impossible for any small business to do that. You are not going to be investing in your own business. Youre not going to be hiring new employees. youre not going to be growing your product base or promoting innovation. Youre now going to be spending more time and more capital dealing with regulations and mandates and more time with lawyers and accountants. We also cant forget the threat that this holds for principles that are the foundation of our Nations tax policy. and that is that States must not be allowed to extend their taxation and regulatory authorities beyond their borders. The Internet tax would do away with the physical presence standard which dictates that a State can only require a business to collect a sales tax if its physically present within its boundaries. Furthermore. the people dont want an online sales tax. A recent survey found that 84 percent of consumers were opposed to this bill and 75 percent of small online retailers are opposed. Those numbers send a clear message that the American people are strongly opposed to this proposal. So I would ask my colleagues thisremember this is the peoples House. Were here to represent our districts and our States and do what is best for them. The problem back in this town. in Washington. D.C.. is that the big businesses. the big corporations. have lobbyists here to be the voice here on the Hill. We need to be the voice tonight for the small business people who dont have lobbyists here in Washington. D.C.. because they cant afford them. Imposing a new tax burden in these precarious economic times is clearly not what our small businesses and consumers need. I know one of the fastest ways to slow down growth and innovation is to tax it and to regulate it. This bill is a $23 billion tax increase coming right out of the pockets of hardworking American families. So let me be clear. The socalled Marketplace Fairness Act is a jobkilling tax hike that hurts Americas small businesses. and it hurts Americas consumers. I promise I will continue to fight this bad piece of legislation."
1130033580,"Mr. Speaker. Im grateful for my good friend from North Dakota. KEVIN CRAMER. for this time to talk about what is really important to the people out in the heartland. which sometimes is a very different set of values than what we find right here in the beltway of Washington. I was also struck by my good friend from Kentucky. ANDY BARR. as he shared his comments. It reminds me that we are the party. we are the leaders back here standing for the working middle class in this country. standing for jobs. for revenues that go to our schools. and the tax base for lowcost energy. This President says one thing. but the consequence of this policy is something that will only ultimately benefit the elite and the wealthy in this country instead of the regular working families in this country. I want to thank my friends here today for organizing this Special Order and bringing attention to the importance of an American energy sector to our economy and to the daily lives of all Americans. In Montana. we know the importance of a robust energy sector. Whether its oil. gas. coal. wind. water. biomass. its all needed to create jobs and keep energy costs low for the people of our country. In fact. one of my priorities in Congress is to fight for the allofthe -above energy plan that helps grow American jobs. lowers energy costs. and helps us fight for North American energy independence. energy security. Unfortunately. President Obama does not seem to share this goal. In fact. yesterday. President Obama unveiled his latest energy plan. a jobkilling agenda that will hurt American jobs and American families and small businesses. After his announcement yesterday. President Obama made a commitment to waging war on American energy. which was made crystal clear. In fact. by imposing further barriers to the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and by working to severely hinder American coal production. President Obama has unveiled a misguided agenda that will only hurt Montana and American energy consumers and will cost goodpaying Montana jobs. Montanas energy sector is a huge driver for our States economy. Our coal mining industry employs over 1.200 workers across our State. Montana contains more coal reserves than any other State in America. and it ranks number six overall in coal production nationwide. Additionally. coal production provides critical funding for Montana schools. as much of our States coal is located on school trust lands. We forget about the contribution to our tax base. that of helping build schools and funding teachers. which comes from the energy industry. The development of our coal reserves produces millions of dollars for Montana public education every year. My daughter is a senior at Montana State University. preparing to graduate and go into elementary education in Montana. Energy production will be critical to funding our public schools in Montana as we look down the road. We have also seen tremendous growth from the booming development of the Bakken formation. as my friend from North Dakota alluded to. which spreads across eastern Montana and into western North Dakota. Oil production in our State has created thousands of goodpaying jobs. both in the oil fields and also in the service industries that are at the heart of many of our small towns. I would like to have the President come out to eastern Montana and see whats happening out there. Families are struggling. living month to month. but are seeing the benefits now of the energy industry as they are seeing paychecks they can count on as they look forward. It has also injected millions of dollars into our States economy. and. like coal. it has helped provide millions of dollars in muchneeded funding for Montanas schools. Recent reports show that Bakken oil production currently accounts for 11 percent of the total U.S. oil production and represents 40 percent of increased oil production nationwide. If the Keystone XL pipeline is built. it would be able to move up to 100.000 barrels of oil. Thats Montana and North Dakota oil per day from our very own Bakken formation. Mr. President. I am in favor of ""made in America"" energy. Montanas natural resources. like coal and oil. not only provide our State and Nation with quality American energy. but they are helping keep the utility costs low for hardworking American taxpayers. Montana gets more than half of its power from coal. That helps keep electric rates low. We see some electric cars driving down the highways today and in our towns. Im not opposed to electric cars. but if the truth be known. we ought to have a sticker on the back that reads: ""This electric car likely powered by coal."" The average retail price in Montana is currently 8.4 cents per kilowatt hour. which is among the lowest in the Nation. The construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. on the other hand. would also have a tremendous impact on energy prices for Montanans. In fact. not too long ago. I was traveling around our State. I am the only Member of Congress for the State of Montana. Its a privilege to represent an entire State. I was up in Glasgow. Montana. meeting with the NorVal Electric CoOp. I learned that the NorVal Electric CoOp is expected to supply power for one of the Keystone pump stations. If the Keystone pipeline is built. it will help NorVal keep its customers electric rates stable for the next 10 years. Think about that10 years of no increase. Contrast that to. if the pipeline is not built. NorVal expects that their rates will grow upwards of 40 percent over the next decade. Mr. President. these customers at NorVal live month to month. They live paycheck to paycheck. This is what is helping American middle class. hardworking taxpayers surviveexpanding our energy production. By declaring a war on energy right now. you are declaring a war on American families who are struggling every month to make ends meet. For most Montanans who live on tight budgets and who carefully track where their paychecks are going. unlike a lot of the folks around here in Washington. D.C.. a 40 percent increase in utility rates would be devastating. Unfortunately. under President Obamas agenda. that very well could happen. President Obamas war on coal would severely hinder coal production in Montana and the jobs that rely on this important industry. It would be a serious blow to Montana families and to small businesses that rely on coal as a reliable source of affordable electricity. Just as bad. this jobkilling agenda will be imposed through unilateral action. demonstrating that the President is more set on achieving his own political goals rather than on listening to the will of the American people or on working to create muchneeded jobs. Mr. President. the people of America are focused on paying their bills every month. Thats a higher priority to them than your priority. which is that of winning an election in 2014. By sidestepping Congress and public scrutiny. President Obama will set his agenda in motion through costly regulations and more and more red tape and bureaucratic hoops. These roadblocks wont just hurt the coal industry as we know President Obama and his advisers seek to do. these regulations will hurt hardworking American taxpayers who rely on American energy each and every day. Let me be clear: President Obamas agenda isnt just a war on coal. This is a war on Montana energy. on Montana families. on Montana small businesses. and on Montana jobsand it must be stopped. I will remain steadfast in this fight to stop the Presidents jobkilling agenda. and I look forward to working with my colleagues here today on commonsense policies that grow American energy and help create the goodpaying jobs that the American people desperately need."
1130040276,"Mr. Chairman. I stand in strong opposition to this amendment. which amounts to the unilateral reduction of our nuclear forces. Unilateral reductions of our nuclear forces are wrong for national securityperiod. These reductions have been directly and explicitly recommended against by the Joint Chiefs and senior DOD civilian officials. all who have said that reductions must be made bilaterally in concert with Russia. I am deeply concerned that not only is this proposal to unilaterally disarm unwise. it is also shortsighted. It could seriously diminish the longterm security of our Nation. We face a world today in which nuclear threats to the United States are increasing and our conventional military capabilities face dramatic reductions. Given this. our nuclear deterrent is becoming more important. not less. Malmstrom Air Force Base. in my home State of Montana. is home to 150 of our Nations intercontinental ballistic missiles. Earlier this year. I visited Malmstrom and I met with the leaders of the 341st Missile Wing to discuss the importance of our ICBM mission to our national security. Colonel Robert W. Stanley. the commander at Malmstrom. gave me this commanders coin. which bears a motto that truly sums up why our defense strategy is effective. It says this: ""Scaring the hell out of Americas enemies since 1962."" This motto clearly demonstrates the importance of our peacethroughstrength strategy. We cannot underestimate the role that our strong nuclear defenses have played in keeping America secure and maintaining peace not only with Russia. but throughout the world. In fact. some say we have never had to use our ICBMs. I would argue we use them every day to ensure that the world is a safer place. That is why I urge my colleagues to also support the amendment that Ive introduced. alongside Congressman LAMBORN. Congresswoman LUMMIS. and Congressman CRAMER. Our amendment will help keep America safe by maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent and preventing the Obama administration from pursuing efforts to unilaterally reduce our nuclear arsenal. The Obama administration requested funds in their 2014 budget proposal to do environmental impact studies of our ICBMs. which is widely seen as a back door to attempting to reduce our ICBM fleet. Our amendment simply prohibits this study. Now is not the time to reduce our ICBM fleet. which is why I would urge all of my colleagues to oppose Mr. QUIGLEYs amendment and to support the DainesLambornLummisCramer amendment. I yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlewoman from Wyoming ."
1130077207,"Mr. Speaker. I want to give my thanks to the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee for his support and leadership in moving this bill through the House. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to proudly offer H.R. 2259. the North Fork Watershed Protection Act. for consideration in the full House. This bill is special to Montana for many reasons. The Flathead River is one of the most cherished waterways in our great State. and our country. for trout fishing. In fact. it is considered a ""red ribbon"" stream. That is Montanas version of a blue ribbon trout stream. The Flathead is an area beloved by the local community for recreation and supporting the regions forestbased economy. Last but not least. this watershed is a gateway to one of the crown jewels of the National Park system. Glacier National Park. Protecting the watershed and ensuring its value extends for future generations has been a task shared by Governors and legislatures of both parties. our neighboring Canadian Province of British Columbia. as well as our local Chambers of Commerce. It is also supported by Montana Senators Max Baucus and JOHN TESTER. and myself. We all support protecting this area for future generations. It makes this bill the first lands legislation supported by the entire Montana delegation in nearly 30 years. The North Fork Watershed Protection Act protects 430.000 acres along the North and Middle Forks of the Flathead River from mineral development. Eighty percent of leases in this area have already been voluntarily relinquished. The bill explicitly protects the rights of existing leaseholders. and there is no loss in production. The North Fork Watershed Protection Act represents commonsense resource management. It is the kind of common sense Montanans understand and Washington. D.C.. needs more of. The North Fork Watershed Protection Act ensures the regions current usesforest management. hunting. fishing. outdoor recreation. quality water supply for local communities. access to gravel for infrastructure maintenance. and livestock grazingwill continue for many generations to come because that is our way of life in Montana. The North Fork Watershed Protection Act is a key to international agreement between the State of Montana and British Columbia. In fact. in February of 2010. the Province of British Columbia and the State of Montana signed a Memorandum of Understanding to preclude mineral development along the Flathead. British Columbia completed prohibition of mineral development along the Flathead River in 2011. The North Fork Watershed Protection Act is necessary to hold up the U.S. end of the bargain and to be a good neighbor. The Canadian province has expended significant resources for the sake of upholding this agreement and strongly supports passage of this legislation so their efforts will be solidified. The bill also has an unprecedented mix of supporters. from ConocoPhillips. Anadarko. and Chevron. to Ducks Unlimited. Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. and local chambers of commerce. This unity across diverse stakeholders is reflective of the bills strong support among Montanans. It is time we get this done. Montanans have been working toward protecting the Flathead for decades. Senator Max Baucus began work to protect this watershed in his very first year in Congress. That was back in 1974. when he was Montanas Congressman in the House. I am proud to be part of the effort to get it done and across the finish line. Passage of the North Fork Watershed Protection Act is a major stop towards a commonsense goal that Montanans have worked toward together for decades. Though Senator Bachus has now retired and is serving in China. the passage of the North Fork Watershed Protection Act will send a strong message to the Senate to get it done. I urge passage of H.R. 2259. the North Fork Watershed Protection Act."
1130108660,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Hearing that water services delivery could be in jeopardy for 60.000 acres of some of the most productive farmland in my home State of Montana. I was happy to introduce this legislation that ensures that irrigation in southwest Montana is protected. H.R. 4508 protects irrigation and water supplies in the Beaverhead Valley by extending the districts contract while an updated contract is pending approval by the Montana Water Court. This contract extension is necessary since the Montana court system is in the middle of conducting a necessary Staterequired review of the new contract between the irrigation district and the United States. This bill does not prejudice the outcome of that examination but keeps in place the existing 1958 contract so area farmers and ranchers in the Beaverhead Valley of Montana have water supply certainty for nearly 60.000 acres. The legislation has no cost to the Federal Government and is based on congressional precedent. In fact. Congress has extended this 1958 contract a number of times. since an extension provides an irrigation district with an absolute right under Federal law to negotiate a new contract with the Bureau of Reclamation. This bill simply adds 6 additional years to the last extension. thereby extending the 1958 contract until December 31. 2019. or until a new contract is executed. This bill is the result of hard work that is being done in Montana. I especially want to thank Mr. Bill Hritsco and the East Bench Irrigation District for their leadership and for working with me on this legislation to provide Montana farmers and Montana ranchers with muchneeded certainty about their water supply. Mr. Hritsco. the Dillon. Montanabased attorney representing the Irrigation District. provided expert testimony on this bill before the House Natural Resources Committee earlier this year. The Irrigation Districts work with me on this bill represents how Montanans can roll up their sleeves and get good things done. As a result. water will continue to flow in the Beaverhead Valleys fields for years to come if this legislation is enacted. I urge adoption of the bill. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130110212,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for her leadership on this important issue of this donothing Senate. The President likes to refer to us as the donothing Congress. Well. tonight. we are presenting 332 reasons why it is actually the donothing Senate. as seen by the stack of the bills here on the gentlewomans desk. This has made it the least productive Congress in history. 332 bills have passed the House and are sitting on HARRY REIDs desk. These are not just Republican bills. 178 of these bills passed the House with no opposition at all. In fact. nearly 70 percent of these bills passed with twothirds support or more. Fiftyfive of these House bills were introduced by Democratsstill. HARRY REID refuses to bring these bills up for a vote. While House Republicans are focused on building up Americas middle class. the Senate Democrats are content to let dust gather on hundreds of bills that would grow the economy. reduce the size and scope of an overbearing Federal Government and. importantly. help create jobs in America. Take the Keystone XL pipeline. for example. This is truly one of those shovelready projects that would create more than 42.000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide. Across the political spectrum. there is overwhelmingly support for this project. yet HARRY REID refuses to bring it up for a vote. I have got that bill right here. It is H.R. 3. This is a bill that we passed with bipartisan support. yet HARRY REID refuses to bring it up for a vote. The Keystone pipeline enters Montana. It is the first State that the pipeline enters after it comes to us from Canada. I was out in eastern Montana recently. and I was meeting with the NorVal Electric CoOp. This is a small coop in Montana that provides electricity to a few thousand Montana families. They told me that if the Keystone pipeline is approved. they will be able to keep electric rates for these Montana families flat for the next 10 years. If the Keystone pipeline is not approved. the electric rates for these Montana families will go up about 40 percent over the course of the next 10 years because this coop supplies electricity to one of the pump stations on the Keystone pipeline. and that extra volume will lower the rates for all users. Sometimes. I wish the President would get out of the White House and come to a place like Montana and talk to those families and have him explain to them why he continues to block the Keystone pipeline. I would like HARRY REID to come out to Montana and explain to these Montana families why the Senate refuses to take up a vote and approve the Keystone pipeline. The House. we are going to continue enacting solutions to help create jobs and build a healthy economy because that leads to greater freedom and opportunity. We are not going to stop doing our job simply because Senator Majority Leader HARRY REID has stopped doing his. It is time for the Senate to get back to work. It is interesting. it has been quoted here tonight that SHEILA JACKSON LEE. the Democratic congresswoman. who we serve with here in the House. has had 18 rollcall votes on her amendments in the House in the past year. That is more than all the Republicans in the Senate combined. When asked about those amendments in a recent interview. she said. ""I want to thank the Republicans for their generosity."" It is time for the Senate to act. The Obama recovery. economic recovery. is 5 years old. and what have we seen? We shared this week the share of adults who are working is back to 1984 levels. That is the year I graduated from Montana State University. with a degree in engineering. Far more adults have left the workforce than have found new jobs. and it has been said this is the worst recovery ever for longterm employed Americans. The House has passed dozens of bills to create goodpaying jobs and build a healthy economy. bills like the Americas Small Business Tax Relief Act. which would lower costs for small businesses to allow them to hire more workers. or the Veterans Economic Opportunity Act. which improves programs that promote economic opportunity and ensures our Nations vets have the tools and resources they need to find jobs they deserve. Let me conclude by saying this: it is a shame that HARRY REID and the Senate Democrats wont take up more of these 40plus bills of these over 300 bills that we have passed that will get our economy moving because it is clear that the Presidents policies arent working. House Republicans have a plan to get America back to work and get our economy moving in the right direction once again. Senate Majority Leader HARRY REID. he doesnt have to agree with our ideas. That is the nature of democracy. That is the nature of having the Senate and the House. We are not expecting him to agree on our ideas. but he does owe them a simple upordown vote. If he doesnt owe it to us. he certainly owes it to the American people."
1130118253,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2. the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act. New technology has fueled a 21st century energy boom. but Americans are still paying way too much for everyday expenses like gas. groceries. and electricity. That is why the House has passed dozens of bills to lower energy costs and create jobs. like a bill that I introducedand passedcalled the Bureau of Reclamation Conduit Hydropower Development Equity and Jobs Act. It passed unanimously last year. This is commonsense legislation. It would expand hydropower production in a number of Western States. It creates jobs while lowering electric prices for thousands of families. Whether it is from approving the Keystone XL pipeline to stopping these outoftouch regulations on our coal industry. the House is fighting to protect and grow American energy and the jobs it supports. In fact. in Montana alone. more than 5.000 jobs depend on coal. and thousands of middle class families rely on coalfired power for an affordable source of energy. Fiftyone percent of the electric supply in Montana comes from coal. Construction of the Keystone pipeline will not only create thousands of good jobs. it is going to help keep energy prices low for Montana families. Let me tell you why. I was out traveling in eastern Montana in my pickup. I visited the NorVal Electric Coop in Glasgow. Montana. It will provide power for a future Keystone pump station on the pipeline. If Keystone is built. NorVal will be able to keep their consumers electric rates flat for the next 10 years. but. if it isnt. they expect that rates will grow upwards of 40 percent for those ratepayers over the course of the next decade. These are hardworking Montana families. many of them living paycheck to paycheck. many on fixed incomes. that we will help with the Keystone pipeline. Unfortunately. tomorrow marks the 6year anniversary from the time the first permit to build the Keystone pipeline was filed. It took the Canadians 7 months to approve it. We are now at 6 years and waiting with this President. The American people have waited far too long. That is why the House has passed legislation to approve its construction. but the Senate refuses to act. It is time for the Senate and the President to join us in fighting for solutions to create jobs. lower energy costs. and protect middle class American families.

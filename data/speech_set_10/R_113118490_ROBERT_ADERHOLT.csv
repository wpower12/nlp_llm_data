1130048084,Thank you. Chairman ROGERS. for giving me the opportunity to speak in support of H.J. Res. 59. which is the FY14 continuing resolution. Of course I think its very obvious by the comments that the Republicans have made on our side this morning that we do need to keep the government open at its current sequestered funding level and continue to provide the vital services that our constituents have grown to expect from government. and certainly make sure that we dont have a government shutdown. As Chairman ROGERS had mentioned. I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture. Some may ask. why is it so important that we keep the government open? Cant we just go with another yearlong CR? Id like to provide some reasons why the FY14 Ag Approps bill that passed the committee provides great benefits to the taxpayer and why we dont need to go to a yearlong CR. and certainly why we dont need to do a government shutdown. In the Ag Appropriations bill. we direct the States to be in full compliance with WIC and SNAP eligibility standards. and we increase oversight of vendors to rein in the costs. We require the USDA to report on strategies that are being implemented to help weed out fraud. waste. and abuse in the SNAP program. One thing that I hear a lot about is the new school meal regulation. We want to provide more flexibility for local school districts as they implement these new school regulations for meals for the students. We require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to develop costbenefit analysis of several DoddFrank provisions that are deemed to be duplicative and also very costly. We encourage the USDA to finalize an inspection rule that has proven to decrease illnesscausing pathogens in poultry operations at a reduced Federal cost. I can tell you. representing a district that grows a lot of poultry and produces a lot of poultry. that is very important. So. in closing. Madam Speaker. let me just say I fully support H. Res. 59 and ask for my colleagues to do the same.
1130052617,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I rise this afternoon in support of H.J. Res. 75. which would continue funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women. Infants. and Children. or commonly known as the WIC program. The fiscal year 2013 Agriculture appropriations bill provided sufficient funding. even after sequestration. totaling $6.5 billion. to ensure that all participants receive both nutritious food and the nutrition services that are necessary for their health and their wellbeing. Before the United States Department of Agriculture completely shut down its Web site. information could be found on their Web site stating that shortterm funding was available for WIC through the contingency reserve fund. carryover funds. and other available resources. While some States have indicated they have sufficient funds to at least work several more weeks. other States are not so fortunate. Many of us have seen headlines. perhaps received phone calls into our offices from constituents who have reported that their appointment at their local WIC clinic has been canceled or that clinics are being closed. Numerous times we have heard our colleagues across the aisle mention that WIC cannot continue without an appropriation for fiscal year 2014. and this will leave millions of women. infants. and children without proper nutrition. Now is a chance. Madam Speaker. for my colleagues to join us in keeping this important program fully functioning and operational. By passing the resolution that we have on the floor this afternoon. we will help 8.7 million lowincome women. infants. and children who are nutritionally at risk to continue to receive the nutrition they need. This resolution will keep WIC clinics across the Nation open. No more appointments will have to be canceled. I believe that every Member of this House of Representatives believes that WIC participants need and should get the participation they need. and I would ask my colleagues to support this resolution. that we supply adequate nutrition for women. infants. and children as we move forward. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130053334,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 77. which would continue the funding for the Food and Drug Administration. I think everyone here in the House agrees that funding for the FDA is necessary to this critical operation in order to support our Nations public health and the millions of jobs associated with FDA activities. Most Members of this body may not realize it. but FDAregulated industries account for almost 25 percent of the consumer spending in the United States of America. Fiscal year 2013 ag appropriation included total funding of $4.2 billion. $2.5 billion came from discretionary funds and $1.7 billion from user fees. Of greatest importance is the need to ensure that our constituents continue to consume safe foods and use safe and effective drugs and medical devices. Despite reduced funding levels overall for FY 2013. we were able to provide a strategic increase of $12.5 million for food safety activities and $10 million for food and drug safety inspections in China. These funding increases will continue under a CR. In addition to the funds appropriated for the FDA. this resolution that we are debating this afternoon would allow FDA to collect and spend drug and medical product user fees. Of course. the fees are charged to the industry to support such lifesaving activities for the review and approval of new and generic drugs as well as medical devices. This House has already passed a resolution to fund the public health activities at the NIH. and it awaits the Senates approval. Also. USDA meat and poultry inspectors were deemed critical to our Nations food supply and have stayed on duty during this temporary delay in funding. It is now time for this body to continue funding one more critical component of our public health infrastructure. The Food and Drug Administration touches every Member of this House. either directly or indirectly. and we need the entire Agency back at work. We need to also limit any damage to the millions of jobs impacted by FDAs work in the food and bioscience industries. Now is the chance for my colleagues here in the House to join me in keeping this important program fully operational. I would ask that my colleagues support this resolution that were debating this afternoon. It will ensure that all critical elements of our Nations food and drug supply will be protected. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130053377,I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I would hope that all of my colleagues would join me tonight in supporting House Joint Resolution 77 that has been discussed here over the last hour. I understand that many of my friends across the aisle would disagree with the majoritys decision to immediately fund the most critical function of government during the delay that we have in current funding. I recognize your preferences for a vote on all the government at one time. but you must recognize the truth of the matter is we dont have consensus in the House. Until the White House and the Senate are willing to sit down and negotiate a quick solution to this stalemate. I ask that my friends across the aisle join me in supporting the Food and Drug Administration. an agency that is on the front lines for our public health on a daytoday basis. There are a number of us who would question why nearly half of the FDA is furloughed when nearly all of their work impacts the safety and protection of human life. However. the administration has chosen to cease activities related to food. to medical devices. and to human drug establishment inspections. infant formula notifications. and to laboratory research that are tied to public health decisionmaking. Most importantly. I would want to think that the administration is not playing politics with the safety of our Nations food supply. but why is it that 87 percent of the Food Safety and Inspection Service is on the job while only about half of FDAs food safety staff are actually working. especially when FDA is responsible for 80 percent of the food supply? As I noted in my opening remarks a few minutes ago. I would speculate that many of our colleagues dont realize how the FDA impacts every single one of our constituents in one way or the other. From formula fed to babies. to blood transfusions needed during emergencies and routine surgeries. to drugs that extend the lives of the sick. to the domestic or imported foods we feed to our families. on every occasion. the FDA is there. Just 2 days ago. this body voted 4070 to approve a measure that will provide backpay to furloughed Federal workers. This vote did not impact the critical needs of public health. yet an important vote. nonetheless. I would ask that each of the 407 Members who voted on Saturday for the backpay for Federal workers to now vote in favor of a bill that provides for urgent needs for our public safety and our welfare across the United States of America. Again. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution. and I yield back the balance of my time.
1130098496,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to begin consideration of H.R. 4800. making appropriations for FY 2015 for Agriculture. Rural Development. Food and Drug Administration. and Related Agencies. The bill before us is unique in that the programs supported in this bill will impact every American every day of the year. We support Americas farmers and ranchers. who are very vital to our Nations economy and our health and wellbeing. We support those at home in need with food and housing and provide rural businesses with lowinterest loans and grants to help them sustain local economies. We help others around the world that face starvation and malnutrition. We support research and development in agriculture to improve productivity and stability. We support the oversight of commodity markets. providing confidence for businesses. traders. investors. and the public. We support a safe food supply and safe and effective drugs and devices. We are fortunate this Nation can and does support these vital programs. The bill before us this afternoon reflects a delicate balance of needs and requirements. We have drafted what I consider a responsible bill for FY 2015 spending levels for the departments and agencies that are under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. We have had to carefully prioritize the funding in this bill. We have had to make some hard choices about how to limit spending. I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky. Chairman ROGERS. for supporting us with a very fair allocation for this bill and for helping us move this bill forward. I also want to thank the gentleman from California . the subcommittee ranking member. He has been a valuable partner and colleague as we have moved forward with this legislation. I appreciate his commitment. I appreciate his understanding as we have moved forward on a wide variety of programs in this bill. and I sincerely thank him for his help. While I and the other subcommittee members have a wide array of agriculture in our districts. Mr. FARR represents an area sometimes referred to as the ""salad bowl of the world."" I want to thank all of the members of the subcommittee for their help. and I also thank the gentlewoman from New York . who is the ranking member for the full committee. I also thank the majority staff for their hard work: Tom OBrien. Betsy Bina. Pam Miller. Andrew Cooper. and Karen Ratzow. I also appreciate the professionalism and the cooperation of the minority staff. In particular. I want to thank Martha Foley and Hogan Medlin for their help during all of the long hours spent putting this bill and report together. as well as Rochelle Dornatt. Troy Phillips. and Caitie Whelan of Mr. FARRS staff. When the subcommittee began the FY15 appropriations process. I asked my colleagues to keep in mind three guiding principles. They were: to ensure the proper use of funds through robust oversight. ensuring the appropriate level of regulation to protect producers and the public. and to ensure funding is targeted to vital programs. These three principles guided us from the time the Presidents budget request was first submitted to the subcommittee until this bill was put before the House today. This basic framework helped us set principles and priorities during the 10 budget hearings and oversight hearings that we had throughout the spring. which covered all of USDAs mission area. as well as the Food and Drug Administration. and also included the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They also formed a framework for us to consider the many requests we received from our colleagues on this bill. In particular. we received more than 3.900 requests from 326 Members to support. reduce. or amend funding levels in the numerous accounts of this bill. Of course we could not meet every request. but we tried to address these requests in a bipartisan manner and in a way that was under the House rules. As such. there are no earmarks included in this bill. The total funding for this bill is $142.5 billion. This is $1.5 billion below the Presidents request and $3 billion below the FY14enacted level. The bill includes $20.88 billion in discretionary budget authority. which is the same as the FY14enacted level. Mandatory spending totals $122 billion. or $3 billion below the FY14 level. These mandatory funds support USDAs farm. conservation. crop insurance. and nutrition programs. I would like to briefly mention a few highlights that are in this bill. We provide $2.8 billion for agricultural research. We have received many. many letters requesting support for the landgrant colleges and universities. We were able to provide level funding for them. We also provided $325 million. as requested. for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. which is USDAs premier competitive research grants program. We provide $870 million for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This agency works to eradicate plant and animal diseases and keeps the bad bugs out of the country. I am pleased to say that we were able to increase funding to combat citrus greening disease and the viral epidemic affecting the hog producers. This funding will supplement the emergency funding that the administration announced last week for research and surveillance purposes. The bill also includes more than $1 billion for the Food Safety and Inspection Service. This is approximately the same as the FY14 level. but $3.8 million above the request. It will maintain more than 8.000 inspectors at more than 6.400 meat. poultry. and egg product facilities across the Nation. The bill provides $1.5 billion for the Farm Service Agency. and it does not allow the closure of any county offices. This proposal made no sense when the 2014 farm bill is still being implemented in county offices across the Nation. We also fully fund the various farm loan programs in this bill. For the Natural Resources Conservation Service. we provide $869 million to help farmers. ranchers. and private forest land owners conserve and protect their land and increase funding to help rehabilitate small dams. This bill is the only one of the 12 appropriations bills that truly focuses on rural America. It provides $2.6 billion for the rural development programs. That includes funding to support $881 million in business and industry loans. $1.3 billion in loans for rural water and waste programs. and $6.2 billion for rural electric and telephone infrastructure. We also provide more than $1 billion for the singlefamily direct loan program. $1.1 billion for rental assistance. and $30 million for the Mutual and SelfHelp program. This bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding for USDAs food and nutrition programs. In particular. it provides $6.6 billion for the Women. Infants. and Children program. This is $93 million below the FY14 enacted level. and it is actually $200 million below the budget request. But I want to be clear about the decreased funding because a declining caseload and large carryover balances from the previous year is why we are doing this. And let me stress that every person who is eligible for the program will be able to receive funding under this funding level in this bill. The bill includes $20.5 billion in required mandatory funding for child nutrition programs and $82.3 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. sometimes referred to as SNAP. This funding level helps support more than 47 million Americans each month. To support those in time of need in places like Syria. South Sudan. and the Central African Republic. the bill provides $1.7 billion for overseas food aid. We were able to provide a $66 million increase for Food for Peace grants. and $13 million for the McGovernDole Education and Child Nutrition Program offset from savings that we found elsewhere in the bill. The Food and Drug Administration receives $2.6 billion in discretionary funding in this bill. This is an increase of $23 million over the FY14 level. When the user fees are included. FDA will receive $4.5 billion in FY15. Within the total. the committee provides a $25 million increase of the full amount requested for food safety activities in the Presidents budget. and drug safety activities are increased by $12 million. Furthermore. the bill includes $218 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This is an increase of $3 million above last years level and is intended to address information technology needs. Before I close. I do want to address one issue that has opened up a necessary dialogue in local cafeterias and schools across the Nation. It is the provision that would allow schools to seek a temporaryand let me stress that it is a temporarywaiver from the current school lunch standards if a school district has lost money over the last 6month period as a result of trying to implement the new regulations. I have had a constant stream of letters. I have talked to people. received emails. and I have had meetings over the past year with school nutritionists. with the teachers. and the school administrators. I have talked to parents. and I have talked to students. all concerned about the rising cost. the increased waste. and the declining participation in the school lunch program. To tell the truth. the students have been concerned about the taste. they have been concerned about the variety and the quality of the meals. But. again. we have gone to the school nutritionists. to the teachers. and the administrators who have identified where the real problem is. This is a real problem in many school districts across the country. Some school districts may not be experiencing this problem. but many. many are across the country. This bill acknowledges the concerns of schools and responds to their requests for a certain amount of flexibility. It only allows schools more time if they need it. In fact. it provides something very similar to the flexibility that USDA recently announced for the whole grain requirements. The benefits to farmers. ranchers. consumers. businesses. and patients provided in this bill far outweigh any one or two objections a Member may have about this bill. The bill represents our best take on matching needs with limited resources. We have tried to work hard to produce the best bill we possibly can within the resources that we have had to work with in this appropriations process. I thank the Members for their attention. and I would urge all the Members to support this bipartisan legislation. I floor as we move forward. and I reserve look forward to passing this bill on the the balance of my time."

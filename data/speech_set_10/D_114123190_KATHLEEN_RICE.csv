1140002307,Mr. Speaker. this is the final amendment to the bill. which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. Like many of you. especially my fellow freshman Members. I told my constituents of New York Citys Fourth Congressional District that I wanted to come to Washington to offer commonsense solutions. As you heard. the amendment does important things that my friends on the other side of the aisle also find important. such as saving tax dollars and providing regulatory relief for small businesses. The amendment also ensures that H.R. 185 would not stymie protections of workers wages. especially those of women. or weaken protections against workplace discrimination. But the most important provision in this amendment. in light of current events. would ensure that H.R. 185 wont apply to actions that prevent terrorism and crime. As the former District Attorney of Nassau County. just outside of New York City. terrorism is not abstract for me and my constituents. It is very real and it is very personal. Thousands of Long Island residents commute to the city every single day. We all remember too clearly the September 11 attacks. and we all live with the reality that such a day could come again if we are not vigilant in our efforts to prevent terrorism. The horrendous attacks in France last week serve as a tragic and chilling reminder that we must be on high alert here at home. and the best way to do that is to ensure that those who protect us have the resources they need to do their jobs. That is our jobto make sure they have the resources they need to do theirs. Mr. Speaker. I will make one final point. A number of freshman Members. myself included. came to Congress with a mandate to find compromise and to govern. Passing H.R. 185 will not demonstrate such priorities. We should be working together to actually solve problems. We should be working to find new ideas and new solutions to our Nations problems and creating legislation that will make our government work more effectively. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140008288,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 719. the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker. as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security. I have a responsibility to ensure that the Transportation Security Administration operates effectively and efficiently. Part of this responsibility includes working to ensure that not a single taxpayer dollar is wasted so that resources are properly expended to protect our Nations airports and the traveling public. Regrettably. we have learned from the Department of Homeland Securitys inspector general that the TSAs Office of Inspection is not operating effectively and efficiently. Specifically. we have learned that taxpayer dollars have been wasted in a manner that may well be undermining the effectiveness and integrity of internal investigations and inspections within the TSA. According to a report issued by the inspector general in September of 2013. some employees in the Office of Inspection were designated ""criminal investigators"" and have received the premium pay and early retirement benefits commensurate with that position. despite the fact that they perform little to no investigative duties. Apparently. the Office of Inspection knowingly made these improper designations and knowingly conferred better pay and benefits to employees who did not do the work required to justify such compensation. If no changes are made to the number of criminal investigator positions. the inspector general estimates that it will result in the wasting of as much as $17.5 million over 5 years. H.R. 719 seeks to put an end to this wasteful practice and prevent it from happening in the future. Mr. Speaker. this bill would require TSA to certify that all persons designated as criminal investigators are working on criminal investigations at least 50 percent of their time. If the TSA wants to provide an employee with the enhanced pay and benefits that criminal investigators receive. then they should have to certify that the employee is actually performing the duties of a criminal investigator. That is just common sense. This measure would not affect individuals in that office who legitimately hold the criminal investigator title and would not impede efforts to thwart terror plots and other criminal enterprises that threaten our national security. Again. this legislation is common sense. It reflects a commitment to good government and the careful stewardship of taxpayer dollars. The House unanimously approved identical legislation in the last Congress. and I urge my colleagues to do the same with this bill. This is an opportunity for bipartisan action to solve a problem and demonstrate the strength of our commitment to eliminate wasteful spending. Mr. Speaker. in closing. I would like to commend Chairman KATKO. as well as the gentleman from South Carolina. Representative SANFORD. for their work on this legislation. If enacted. H.R. 719 will bring greater accountability to TSAs Office of Inspection and ensure taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and that past abuses are not being repeated. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140008302,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 720. the Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015. and yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the bill before us today is named in honor of Officer Gerardo Hernandez. a Transportation Security Administration officer who was tragically shot and killed in the line of duty on November 1. 2013. at Los Angeles International Airport. Officer Hernandez was the first TSA employee ever to be killed in the line of duty. and this bill that bears his name seeks to better prepare our Nations airports to respond to such security incidents in hopes that we can prevent another TSA officer. airport employee. or passenger from suffering the same fate. That morning in November 2013. a man entered LAX with a semiautomatic rifle. a bagful of ammunition. and the intent to target TSA officers. After killing Officer Hernandez at the TSA checkpoint. the man proceeded into the secure area of the terminal where he shot and wounded two more TSA officers and a civilian. Those two TSA officers heroically continued to help passengers escape to safety while the shooter made it as far as the food court at the end of the terminal before he was shot and wounded by LAX police officers. The men and women of the Los Angeles World Airports Police Department and all emergency responders who arrived on the scene that morning acted bravely and swiftly prevented further loss of life despite tremendous communications challenges. It is with those men and women and all emergency responders in mind that I rise to support this bill because this incident exposed serious deficiencies in planning. preparedness. and communication that must be corrected for the safety of emergency responders and all who use and work in our airports. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 720 would implement commonsense security measures to ensure that our Nations airports have in place individualized strategies for responding to a security incident such as an active shooter scenario or an act of terrorism. This bill also specifically requires TSA to provide information to airports on best practices for responding to a security incident at checkpoints. provide Transportation Security officers with practical training for responding to active shooter scenarios. and conduct a nationwide assessment of the interoperable communications capabilities of the law enforcement. fire. and medical personnel responsible for responding to an active shooter event at an airport. These requirements are informed by postincident reviews conducted by TSA and LAX. as well as hearings and oversight work conducted by the Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security. Mr. Speaker. prior to my time here in Congress. I understand that the Subcommittee on Transportation Security also visited LAX to see firsthand how the tragedy unfolded and hear from TSA airport officials and the American Federation of Government Employees about how the response to a similar incident can be improved going forward. I hope that we can continue that productive dialogue with LAX and our other airports and work together to better prepare for such violence in the airport environment. We will never forget what happened at LAX on November 1. 2013. nor can we afford to forget the lessons to be learned from that tragic day. The threats to our Nations airports are ceaseless and constantly evolving. There could be another attack on any given day at any given airport. We must assume that it will happen. We must be more prepared. We must do better. We owe it to Officer Hernandez and his family. That is why I rise today in support of H.R. 720. and I urge all of my colleagues to pass this important bill. With that. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140020227,Mr. Speaker. this is the final amendment to the bill. which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. Mr. Speaker. the most important job we have is to protect the American homeland and the American people. The threats against our country are ceaseless and constantly evolving. and we too must evolve and adapt in our efforts to maintain the domestic security that the American people have entrusted us to uphold. Passing H.R. 1560 will be a significant step forward in that effort. Our Nations cyber infrastructure is under attack every single day from hackers. from foreign nations. and from terrorists. I believe H.R. 1560 will strengthen our governments ability to coordinate with companies in the private sector. share intelligence. and respond to these threats. but I also believe the legislation should be stronger. We know that foreign nations and terrorist organizations are actively seeking to steal American military intelligence and technology. and we know that terrorists are using the Internet to spread their poisonous ideology. recruit American citizens to join their ranks. and encourage attacks here in America. Just this week. six Minnesota men were arrested after trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. Last week. authorities arrested an Ohio man who actually trained with a terrorist group in Syria and returned to the U.S.. intent on carrying out an attack on our soil. Earlier this month. two women in my home State of New York were arrested for planning to detonate a bomb in New York City. Mr. Speaker. this amendment will help prevent a domestic terror attack by allowing Federal agencies to coordinate and prioritize the sharing of cyber threat intelligence regarding known terrorist organizations like the Islamic State. Boko Haram. al Shabaab. and al Qaeda and its affiliates. groups that use the Internet and social media as a weapon in their efforts to attack the United States and the American people. Likewise. this amendment will direct Federal agencies to prioritize the sharing of intelligence regarding attempts by terrorists and foreign nations to steal American military technology. This amendment will help protect our Nation and the people we serve. I have no doubt that that is the highest priority for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. so we must also make it a priority to neutralize these threats and do all that we can to thwart the violent ambitions of those who want to do us harm. Again. Mr. Speaker. I believe H.R. 1560 is important legislation that deserves bipartisan support. but I believe this amendment deserves the same. It will make the legislation stronger. make the American people safer. and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140026702,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of my legislation. H.R. 1382. the Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act. I doubt there is a single Member of this body who would disagree that American veteransmen and women who have stepped up to protect our country and preserve the freedom that we cherishdeserve our full support when they have completed their service. They deserve the opportunity to find a good job. to support themselves and their families. They deserve the opportunity to succeed in civilian life. to adapt their extraordinary skills. training. and experience in order to thrive in a civilian workforce. and to continue making a meaningful contribution to our economy. We have seen real progress in adding veterans to the workforce. but we cannot be satisfied with that progress while so many men and women still struggle to find the good jobs they deserve. We cannot be satisfied when the unemployment rate among post9/11 veterans remains higher than the national average. We cannot be satisfied if even a single American veteran who wants to work is not given the opportunity to do sois left jobless. homeless. forgotten. and abandoned by the country he or she served. Unemployment among veterans is not only a stain on the character of our country. it is not only a dereliction of the promise we make to the people who risk their lives to protect us. it is a missed opportunity. Veterans have received the most advanced and sophisticated training the world has to offer. They have unique skills and experience. They know how to work as members of a team. They know how to succeed in the most difficult conditions. They know how to get the job done. whatever that job may be. They received that training. they developed those skills. and gained that experience because we invested in them as servicemembers. and we would be foolish not to double down on that investment. We would be foolish not to invest in them as veteransinvest in their potential to adapt their training and skills and experience so they may use it to thrive in a civilian workforce and contribute to our economy. We need businesses in the private sector to recognize the benefit of having veterans in their workforces. We need businesses to recognize that it is in their selfinterest to actively seek out and employ veterans. not as an act of charity. but because they are excellent workers who know how to get the job done and how to bring out the best in their fellow employees. That is why it is so important that we pass H.R. This legislation will make the kind of investment that Members of both parties can be pleased to supportthe kind that costs no money. The Department of Veterans Affairs is already authorized for $19 billion in total procurement and contracting spending. This legislation will simply ensure that. when the Secretary of the VA is awarding those contracts. he has the authority to give preference to businesses with high concentrations of fulltime veteran employees. businesses that make it a priority to actively seek out veterans and provide them with meaningful fulltime employment. As has been noted. the VA can already give such preference to veteranowned businesses. as it should. We should give that same advantage to contractors who actively invest in veterans. who recognize their value and their potential to thrive in the civilian workforce. Such companies do exist. and this legislation will reward them for their commitment to giving veterans the opportunities they have earned. But in doing so. in creating such an advantage. this legislation will also create an incentive for other contractors to do the same. to be proactive. to make it a priority to seek out veterans who are looking for employment. In time. I have no doubt that they will recognize the value of investing in veterans as they will find themselves with a more productive. efficient. and effective workforce. Mr. Speaker. I want to give a special thanks to my colead sponsor on the other side of the aisle. Congressman PAUL COOK. a combat veteran who served 26 years and retired as a colonel from the United States Marine Corps. I also think it is important to note that this bill has the support of several major veteran service organizations. including the Veterans of Foreign Wars. the American Legion. and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Finally. Mr. Speaker. I would like to express my support for another bill that I am proud to cosponsor. Dr. WENSTRUPS legislationH.R. 474. the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act.
1140045520,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2750. the Improved Security Vetting for Aviation Workers Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker. a recent review by the Department of Homeland Securitys inspector general found that. although TSAs multilayered process for vetting airport workers is generally effective. there were instances where the process did not detect airport workers with potential links to terrorism. In total. the inspector general identified 73 aviation workers with possible links to terrorism after running data against the socalled TIDE database. which is maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center. TSA does not have access to this database under current interagency watch listing policies. Chairman KATKO introduced H.R. 2750 to rectify this situation. and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bipartisan bill. H.R. 2750 will put TSA on a path to accessing terrorismrelated data in order to more effectively vet employees who work in our Nations airports. In addition. this bill will require TSA to conduct an annual review of the procedures for issuing security credentials to employees seeking to work in highly sensitive. secure areas of our airports. Lastly. under H.R. 2750. TSA is authorized to pilot the FBIs Rap Back Service. which provides near realtime information about changes in an airport workers criminal history. The possibility of someone with ties to terrorism getting a job in an American airport is a very real threat. one of many that we live with every day and one that we must do everything in our power to prevent. H.R. 2750 will help neutralize that threat. I urge my colleagues to give it their full support. Mr. Speaker. in closing. together with Chairman KATKO. I am proud of the work that we have done on the Subcommittee on Transportation Security to address this and other pressing transportation security issues within TSA in a constructive. bipartisan way. The four bipartisan TSA bills that we are considering today are a testament to that effort and to what we can accomplish when we work together to solve real problems. I hope that we will continue to make progress together. and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2750. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140045530,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. and I rise in strong support of H.R. 2770. the Keeping Our Travelers Safe and Secure Act. Mr. Speaker. last May. the Department of Homeland Security inspector general released a report with a blunt and revealing title: ""The Transportation Security Administration Does Not Properly Manage Its Airport Screening Equipment Maintenance Program."" The report revealed that TSA lacks strict policies and procedures for maintaining critical screening technology. including xray machines and explosive detection equipment. The consequences of this deficiency could be severe. First. as the inspector generals report noted. the lack of regular maintenance reduces the life of screening equipment. which means TSA would have to incur the cost of new equipment. That is a problem for American taxpayers. Even more importantly. the inspector general also noted that. if screening equipment becomes less than fully operational. TSA will be forced to rely on alternative screening measures that may not be as effective at detecting dangerous items. That creates serious risks for passengers. risks that we can and must eliminate. As threats to our homeland evolve. particularly threats to our commercial aviation sector. we cannot afford to be complacent about maintaining screening equipment. This legislation. which I introduced with Ranking Member THOMPSON. Chairman KATKO. and Representative PAYNE. requires TSA to get serious about maintaining securityrelated technology in our Nations airports. Specifically. it requires TSA. within 180 days of enactment. to develop and implement a comprehensive preventive maintenance validation process. This process must include strict maintenance schedules. clear guidance for TSA personnel and contractors on how to conduct and document maintenance actions. mechanisms to ensure compliance. and penalties for noncompliance. These measures are common sense. This is a threat that we can neutralize. I urge my colleagues to do so by supporting this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker. in closing. I would like to thank members of the Committee on Homeland Security for supporting this legislation. There was truly a constructive bipartisan effort to make this legislation what it is today. and because of it. the commercial aviation sector will be more secure. I once again urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I thank Chairman KATKO for his support. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140045542,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2843. the TSA PreCheck Expansion Act. A decade after Congress directed the establishment of a trusted passenger program. TSA announced its PreCheck pilot program in 2011. Initially. PreCheck participants were frequent flyers of major airlines. Active Duty military members. and participants in other Department of Homeland Security known traveler programs. Over the past 4 years. PreCheck participation has expanded significantly and now encompasses over 1 million Americans who submitted biographic and biometric information and paid a fee to participate in the program. While I am pleased that TSA has reached the milestone of enrolling 1 million people. there are 650 million people who fly in the U.S. every year. and we must keep working to bring more of them into the program. Enrolling in PreCheck is a winwin for passengers and for airport security. Passengers get the benefit of expedited screening. and we get the benefit of an expanded universe of passengers who have undergone extensive vetting and are known to be low risk. and that allows TSA to focus its limited resources on passengers who are unknown and may be higher risk. We can expand PreCheck participation by streamlining the enrollment process to make it more convenient and more accessible. H.R. 2843 seeks to do just that by requiring enrollment standards to include secure technologies such as kiosks and tablets that can collect biographic and biomettic information. Additionally. this bills directs TSA to more aggressively market the PreCheck program. Getting the word out about the merits of PreCheck is vital to ensuring that the program continues to grow. To keep Congress engaged in its progress. this bill requires that TSA report any fees in excess of administration costs. This is also an opportunity for the private sector to work together with the Federal Government to expand PreCheck participation. and this partnership will continue to push the program in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1140060345,Madam Chairwoman. over the course of my career. one issue that has taken on tremendous importance to me is reducing the number of traffic fatalities that occur on our roads and highways. One of the ways we can keep making progress in this area is by focusing on young drivers. As any parent with a teenaged child can tell you. young people do not have the knowledge. experience. and maturity to drive safely 100 percent of the time. and that can have deadly consequences for themselves and for others. In 2013. more than 4.000 people were killed in crashes involving teen drivers. For drivers aged 16 to 19. the fatal crash risk is three times higher than for drivers over age 20. My amendment will help reduce those risks by encouraging all 50 States to adopt core graduated drivers license requirements that we know will help keep teens safe as they learn to drive. This amendment encourages States to enact meaningful requirements to help keep everyone safe on our roads. The amendment would require young drivers to go through two stages of licensing. a learners permit followed by an intermediate stage. Drivers must have a learners permit for at least 6 months. They have to pass vision and knowledge tests. They have to be supervised when they drive. They have to gain 50 hours of experience behind the wheel. with 10 of those hours at night. They must be strictly prohibited from using a cell phone or other device while driving. as all drivers should be. regardless of age. because even the most experienced driver in the world becomes dangerous when they are texting or taking selfies behind the wheel of a car. A learner who passes a driving test advances to the intermediate stage. which lasts at least another 6 months. The cell phone ban remains in place. and violating that restriction must be a primary offense. Intermediate drivers cannot drive after 10 p.m.. with reasonable exceptions. Eighty percent of crashes involving 16- and 17yearold drivers happen between 9 oclock at night and midnight. and this restriction reduces crashes by up to 60 percent during the overnight hours. Intermediate drivers cannot have any drunk driving violations. fake ID violations. reckless driving. failure to wear a seat belt. speeding. or other violations. These are some of the very basic requirements that we know are necessary to help keep young people safe as they learn how to drive. This should be the law in every American State. My amendment helps move us toward that goal by providing grant funding to States that adopt and implement these requirements in full. I want to note that this amendment is supported by the National Safety Council. as well as AAA. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. the Governors Highway Safety Association. Mothers Against Drunk Driving. and Safe Kids Worldwide. The language in this amendment is the same as the language in the DRIVE Act. which passed in the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. I believe it deserves the same bipartisan support in the House. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.

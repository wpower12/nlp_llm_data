1140005248,Mr. Speaker. just last summer. Delta launched The Blue Lightning Initiative with the help of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Blue Lighting Initiative is a computer based training program that provides airlines with the added tools to help ID and report suspected instances of human trafficking. According to Delta. it is among some of the first airlines to adopt this expansive type of human trafficking detection training. Delta and others taking on similar initiatives should be applauded for taking the initiative to end Human Trafficking. one of the greatest challenges we face. As horrific as Human Trafficking is. it is even more troubling that the United States Government is not taking the steps necessary to properly train DHS employees. such as TSA officers. who have the potential to identify cases of trafficking and help save lives. This type of training is what Rep. MARK WALKERs bill H.R. 460. the Human Trafficking Detection Act. aims to achieve. Awareness is key and it is essential to ending the human trafficking epidemic that is stealing the freedom of nearly 27 million people worldwide. Requires DHS to establish a human trafficking training program to be given in classroom or virtually. and to ensure DHS personnel receive this training within 180 days. This training must include: Methods to effectively deter. detect. and disrupt human trafficking. and be relevant for each federal employees particular location or professional environment. This will help to ensure that DHS doesnt simply establish a generic. onesizefitsall approach for all employees. and is able to provide thorough training specific to each employees particular job setting. Other topics determined to be appropriate by the Secretary. A posttraining evaluation for personnel receiving such training. H.R. 460 also allows DHS to provide the human trafficking training curricula to State. local or tribal government. or private organization at the entitys request. This will help these government and private entities establish their own training programs. CBO: Does not expect H.R. 460 to increase federal spending.
1140005347,"Thank you so much for your leadership on this critical evening to express the will of so many Members of Congress that hopefully is the will of the American people. I thank you for your service not only here in Congress. but also for serving the people of King County as sheriff. Mr. Speaker. when we get to call out some of our dear friends who are sheriffs or police chiefs. many times we dont even refer to them by name. It is ""sheriff"" or ""chief."" But tonight. I want to talk a little bit about what I call most of my law enforcement colleagues in western North Carolina. I call them friends. I want to tell a few personal stories. Before I do that. I want to share a little bit about the gentleman from Washington who is leading this tonight. because it is real easy to see the professional side of a Member who serves with distinction here in this body. but sometimes the people back home miss the personal side. Today. we were discussing a number of bills on human trafficking and the unbelievable blight that is on our Nation and on our world where we have more people today in modernday slavery than at the height of the slave trade. But it is personal for this gentleman to my left because time and time again. in meetings. he has brought up the plight of those young girls. their being trafficked at the hands of so many that are out there. It is that personal side that we can applaud tonight. not only for my colleague. but for many of the sheriffs and chiefs that I have the honor of knowing because of being in this position. Mr. Speaker. I can tell story after story. but there is one police chief in my area who shared a story about one of his officers who was working for him who puts his life on the line every single day. and he does it for a little over $12 an hour. When I heard that. I could hardly believe it. because as we start to see the dedication with which our law enforcement officers truly put themselves out each and every day. not only them. but their familiesand we expect them to come home. Mr. Speaker. as has been shared previously. sometimes. they dont come home. so we must do a better job of standing by our law enforcement officers each and every day to thank them. to go out of our way. to make sure that we thank them for their service. thank their families for their sacrifice. There are birthday parties that are missed. anniversaries that are missed. dinner engagements that are missed because when the phone rings or when the call goes off or when the beeper is alert. they are always there. Not answering that call is not an option for them. They are always available. Yet in my district back in North Carolina. we have sheriffs who are getting involved to make sure that the homeless have a place. a warm bed. and a hot meal. a sheriff that has actually gone out in his community in one of my counties that makes sure that those that are in need have a place on Halloween night to come and celebrate in a safe environment. dedicated volunteers over and over. a sheriff back home who really works tirelessly to make sure that the needs of those that are most needy in his community are taken care ofstory upon story. Mr. Speaker. of people who put politics aside and put the interests of their community first. Whether it is a Democrat or Republican. they all work together to make sure that what happens is that their community is safe. Mr. Speaker. they have my back. and I think it is time that the American people stand up and have their back. We need to make sure that we stand with them. I thank the gentleman for his time. for his leadership on this issue. and for his service."
1140018798,"I thank the chairman for his leadership on this particular issue. Mr. Speaker. I think it is important to talk about what this bill is and what it is not. When we talk about tax compliance. it becomes very easy to focus on those hardship cases. very easy to focus. as the gentleman opposite just talked about. on that 3 to 5 percent. depending on which agency you are talking about. This bill is really not about those with hardship cases. as there is already an exemption there. This bill is not about trying to penalize Federal workers. It is really about fairness. Mr. Speaker. Why is it fair that 97 percent in some agency94 and 95 in otherspay their taxes on time. and yet we continue to give others a free pass? My friend opposite would many times suggest. Oh. well. they are complying better than this group and that group. but we need to look no further than the IRS because the IRS implemented a different standard within their agency. Guess what happened. Mr. Speaker? Their compliance went way up. They have one of the best records. that we get to oversee. with the Federal employees. When we started to look at this. the chairman was very careful to make sure that hardship casesthe ones that all of our hearts go out to when people have family situations that preclude them from being able to pay their taxes on a timely basisare an exemption. Yet I would say. whether it is Congress or whether it is the Federal employees. we are held to a different standard because we are paid with the hardworking American taxpayers dollars. It is a higher standard than the private sectors. It is difficult for us to acknowledge that. but we are under the scrutiny that we should be because we have the authority to tax and spend. When you have both of those authorities. Mr. Speaker. it is a different standard. I. for one. can tell you that. from the Federal employees standpoint. it is all about making sure that we are fair to them. What happens is. when the headline is ""Federal employees are not paying their taxes."" for whatever reason it may be. it paints in a bad light the hundreds of thousands of Federal workers who do everything right and on time. Mr. Speaker. I think that what we must do is not only address this for the integrity of the American people but address it for the integrity and the spirit of those Federal workers as well."
1140025731,Madam Speaker. I thank the chairman for his kind words and for his leadership because we would not be here today without the great work of the chairman. the ranking member. Mr. ELIOT ENGEL. and my good friend from Florida. TED DEUTCH. who has dropped everything to try to make sure that we address this critical issue. Because of the incredible Department of Defense and the military men and women that we have serving the great American interests. many Americans believe that the terrorist organizations are poorly organized. they are rogue operations. and some. most of them believe that they are just thousands of miles away. yet terrorist organizations have been thriving for decades and have killed thousands of Americans. These terrorists will be stopped one day. and hopefully today is the beginning of what we do to make sure that that happens. With the growth of technology and globalization. Hezbollah has become illusive and has found ways to raise millions of dollars. You would think that it is just in some faraway place. but we find them as close as our own borders in this hemisphere and. indeed. in my home State of North Carolina. We must do all that we can to cripple Hezbollah and send a message to other terrorist organizations that the United States will not back down. We will protect our people and our allies. We can do this today by enacting the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act. This is more important today than ever before because. as we discuss this particular potential deal with Iran. what we do know is that. as sanctions are relieved. that money will flow. And because the real leader and founder of this vicious terrorist organization is really the Iranian regime. we must act today. Madam Speaker. because we will save American lives. we will save allied lives. and we will stand with our greatest ally in the Middle East. Israel. So I want to close by. indeed. thanking Chairman ED ROYCE for his willingness to engage with our leadership and for their decision to bring this to the floor in a very expeditious manner. I thank Chairman TOM PRICE of Georgia.
1140035421,"I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his leadership and truly for being willing to be the voice of the American people. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to really highlight what so many Americans have a hard time understanding. and that is why we as the American people can continue to allow a government to overreach its true authority and not be reined in. Mr. Speaker. So tonight I want to highlight just a few things. Before I do that. I think it is important that we talk about the Federal workers here that work for the American people. the vast majority of whichI would say almost 99 percent of whichare dedicated public servants who each and every day give their utmost for their fellow man. truly. to serve this great country. So tonight. Mr. Speaker. I rise to really highlight some of those that give the rest of those great Federal workers a bad name. For many of us. they also give us a reason to pause and say: Wait just a minute. How can that happen in this great land? So tonight I feel like it is important that we identify some of these workers who truly have displaced the trust of the American people. They have taken Federal tax dollars. they have continued to take a salary. and yet what we find is they did not uphold their constitutional duty to do what is right on behalf of the American people. We know one example is with the EPA. the gentleman who worked to define the Clean Air Act. We found that. over time. he was not even showing up for work. that he would continue to be paid for years and years and years. that he was paid without showing up. Now. certainly his colleagues would have to know that there was an empty cubicle next to them. but yet. for over a decade. we have an EPA employee who pretended to be a CIA agent. Now. when we start to look at this. here he was not showing up for work. He was traveling all over the world at taxpayers expense. Indeed. what he was continuing to do is pretend like he was an employee of the Federal Government. but not showing up. So my question is really more about accountability. Mr. Speaker. Where was the management team? Where was the accountability? We can understand one bad apple. but where was the management? Well. let me tell you where they were. This particular EPA employee decides that they are going to go and they are going to retire. and so all the management comes together. They give him a great retirement party. He retires and he says: But wait just a minute. You need to continue to pay me because I am still working for the CIA. Now. the sad part about it is they continued to pay him for another 18 months. And. Mr. Speaker. I dont know about you. but that is just hard to believe. It is the thing that novels are made of. but yet this is not fictitious. it is the truth. We have got other EPA employees that are there that are watching porn on their government computer over 6 hours a day for 4 years. Where is the oversight there? And yet. when people are willing to blow the whistle and say. ""This is not right with some of my colleagues."" what do they meet with? Well. we heard at a hearing just this last week that a whistleblower for the Department of Homeland Security in their EB5 program was punished because she dared to speak up. Well. Mr. Speaker. I think it is time that the American people start to hold the management of Federal workers accountable because they are entrusted with that trust that needs to be carried out each and every day. And so tonight I am here to call out Mr. Mayorkas. Recently. an IG report identified Mr. Mayorkas as doing special favors for political operativesallegedly. the Governor of Virginia. allegedly. the brother of our former Secretary of State. What the American people will not stand for. Mr. Speaker. is a double standard. If political favors are going to be given out. the people who give them out should be held accountable. And I appreciate the gentleman from North Carolina. his leadership. because not only is this service on Oversight and Government Reform designed to make sure that we get to the truth of it. but he is unrelenting in his willingness to go after those who live by a double standard. With that. Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina."
1140095982,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his eloquent words. As we look at this particular bill. there is a lot that has been said about what home rule is and what it is not. There is a lot that has been said about what the law is and what it is not. and yet it is undeniable that the Constitution actually reserved for this esteemed body the power to legislate over all affairs within the District. going back to Article I. section 8 of our Constitution. And yet in 1973. Mr. Speaker. this body took on a law. debated it in both the House and the Senate. to actually take some of those authorities granted by the Constitution and allow the District to actually put forth laws with regard to local issues. Now. specifically reserved in that 1973 law was the whole issue of the budget and appropriations. As we started to look at this particular functionmy good friend. the Delegate from the District. obviously has talked very seriously about the law. Well. the law was very clear in 1973 on what we passed. Actually. Charles DiggsChairman Diggshad what they called the Diggs Compromise that specifically was spelled out in a dear colleague letter on the fact that budgetary control would remain with this body and. indeed. with the appropriators. Yet somehow we see a decision by a superior court as having the effect of law? Well. we know from our civics class that it is this body that is putting forth Federal law. It cannot be a local jurisdiction that comes in and usurps the power of the Federal law with its local mandates. So. Mr. Speaker. while my good friend and I will disagree perhaps on a number of issues. what we should agree on is the fact that the Constitution reserved this right for Congress. The Constitution and. indeed. those relegated and delegated powers in 1973 were specific in keeping the appropriations and budgetary process within this body. To ignore that would be. honestly. ignoring the debate that happened then. debate that happens now. and sworn testimony in hearings that. indeed. those who crafted this particular law are all in agreement that this was the intent of Congress. So. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to ask my colleagues to not only support this. but reaffirm the role that Congress has and make sure that we keep it within this body.
1140096115,Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the gentleman from Utah. Chairman CHAFFETZ. for his strong statement in support of H.R. 5233. the Clarifying Congressional Intent in Providing for DC Home Rule Act of 2016. As we begin debate on this important bill. I would like to first take the opportunity to reiterate that I firmly believe that the Local Budget Autonomy Act is. indeed. unlawful and null and void. The Home Rule Act clearly provides that the Districts budget shall pass through the Federal appropriations process. preserving Congress role in the passage of that budget. However. because of the precedent that allowing the District to usurp the congressional authority may set. and the potential negative consequences that the District government employees may face for enforcing the Local Budget Autonomy Act. I have introduced H.R. 5233. I would further say that my good friend. the Delegate from the District of Columbia. Ms. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. indeed is a friend. and I appreciate her passionate way that she always represents her constituency. While we disagree on the debate and the merits of that debate. I cant help but acknowledge my friendship with her and. truly. her passion for the people who she serves. H.R. 5233 will repeal the Local Budget Autonomy Act and reinforce Congress intended role in the budgetary process. As many of you know. Congress was granted that exclusive legislative authority over the District in Article 1. section 8. clause 17. This exclusive authority was explained further in the Federalist 43 as being a crucial component in keeping the Federal Government free from potential influence by any State housing the governments seat. There was a distinct worry that placing the seat of the Federal Government in a territory where Congress was not the sole sovereign would. indeed. impact its integrity. Therefore. the Founding Fathers saw fit to authorize Congress to create the District and act as the sole legislative authority for the District. As seen in Federalist 43. the Founding Fathers believed that Congress would delegate some of those exclusive authorities to the District. specifically the power to deal with solely local matters. In 1973. Congress made a decision to enact such legislation when they passed the Home Rule Act. [ 1615 In that act. Congress provided the District with the authority to have the jurisdiction over legislative matters on a limited basis. Butand this is a critically important pointCongress reserved for itself. and prohibited the District from altering. the role of Congress in the budgetary process. There can be little doubt that Congress intended to reserve that power for itself. The language of the Home Rule Act itself is clear. Both the former and the current attorney general for the District. as well as the former Mayor. believe the Local Budget Autonomy Act to be unlawful and contrary to the Home Rule Act. Mr. Irvin Nathan. the former attorney general. testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that numerous sections of the Home Rule Act prohibit the Districts action. Mr. Nathan. who supports the policy. as my good friend acknowledged. who actually supports the policy of budget autonomy. even stated that he believed the Federal District Courts opinion invalidating the Local Budget Autonomy Act was. indeed. a correct opinion. Beyond the clear language. the legislative history makes it clear. Mr. Speaker. that Congress had no intent to delegate to the District the authority for the budgetary process. In fact. Mr. Jacques DePuy. who participated in the drafting of the Home Rule Act itself. made it clear in testimony before Congress that. indeed. Congress did not intend to delegate the appropriations powers to the District. The legislative record of the Home Rule Act supports Mr. DePuy. One such piece of the record is. indeed. the Diggs letter. which the chairman referenced earlier. that was issued by Chairman Charles Diggs. The letter describes how it was clarifying the intent of Congress by making several changes. including reserving Congress role in the budgetary process. The Diggs letter highlighted a pivotal aspect of the congressional intent in the Home Rule Act. It represents a compromise in response to the Senates Home Rule Act. which actually included a form of budget autonomy. The compromise does not indicate that Congress intended to grant the District budget autonomy. To the contrary. what the Diggs compromise represents is that there could be no Home Rule Act. absent an express reservation of the role of Congress in the Districts budget process. I believe there can be no stronger statement that Congress intended to reserve its appropriation role than the fact that the Home Rule Act would have failed. absent that reservation. Importantly. both of these men. Mr. Irvin and Mr. DePuy. who support budget autonomy further believe that the Districts action is illegal and. therefore. null and void. I want to be clear on this. We are not here today to make a power grab against the District. as some would suggest. We are here. Mr. Speaker. to uphold the rule of law. At the committees hearing. even the chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia was forced to acknowledge that it was clear that the majority of the Members of Congress who passed the Home Rule Act intended to reserve the complete appropriations for Congress. Again. another individual who supports budget autonomy recognizes the intent of Congress. So. in moving ahead with the Local Budget Autonomy Act. the District government is usurping congressional authority. and inaction would undermine not only this institution. but all organs of government across this Nation. To suggest that any city councils action. whether it be here in the District or in any other city in the country. could unilaterally overturn the intent of Congress would set a bad precedent. Regardless of the precedent. however. such action by local government is a blatant violation of the Supremacy Clause and. therefore. unconstitutional. Moreover. as a result of the unlawful way in which the budget autonomy is purported to have been achieved. District government employees are now at risk of the Antideficiency Act and the sanctions therein. Under the Antideficiency Act. absent a congressional appropriation. the District may not expend or obligate funds. Doing so will result in potential criminal or administrative penalties for not only the Districts elected officials. but the line level employees charged with purchasing items for the District. The GAO testified that they maintain that the Local Budget Autonomy Act violates the Home Rule Act and the Antideficiency Act. despite the superior courts decision. H.R. 5233 would repeal the Local Budget Autonomy Act and prevent the District government employees from having to worry that the purchases they make on behalf of the District may indeed violate the law. H.R. 5233 will also augment the already clear prohibitions on the District in altering the role of Congress in the budget process. ensuring that Congress intent and constitutional authority. Mr. Speaker. remains in place.
1140096155,Mr. Speaker. my friend oppositeand I say that in the most authentic and complete terms because. indeed. the gentleman is my friendraises a point of debate about the Constitution and the fact that explicitly in the Constitution. our Founding Fathers reserved this particular authority in Article I. section 8. clause 17. which shows the wisdom of our Founding Fathers to anticipate what. indeed. we are debating here today. For many of the other arguments that my good friend has made in terms of what we need to change. there is the appropriate place for those changes to be made. and that is exactly what this debate has been about. It is about the rule of law. it is about the Constitution. and it is about this institution being the proper place to make those determinations on behalf of the will of We the People. Now. the motion to recommit talks about Zika funding. And I might remind the gentleman that. indeed. in this very body within the last few days. we have already passed funding to address the Zika virus potential healthcare concern. and. indeed. this is the correct body for us to do that. It is not the District of Columbia or any other municipality across the country. It is. indeed. this body. the role for this particular body that has been reserved constitutionally. and it has been that way since the very founding of this great country we all call home. I would also add that. as we start to look at this. the debate has been over local control. And when we start to see the debate that continues to play out. this particular issue was reserved in the Constitution. and it was solely that of Congress to have all legislative power over the District. Now. is that somehow inconsistent with the fact that we want to make sure that all control is local? It is not. Because as we look at that. we must. indeed. make sure that we stand up. And I would ask all of my colleagues to look at the very foundation of who we are as an institution. as Members of Congress. To allow the Budget Autonomy Act to stand in place would not only usurp the authoritythe congressional authoritythat has been given to us in our Constitution but. indeed. it would undermine it for future Congresses to come. So it is with great humility. but also with great passion. that I would urge my colleagues to defeat the motion to recommit. knowing that we have already addressed the particular funding requirement that the gentleman from Virginia brings updefeat the motion to recommit. and support the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140102425,I thank Chairman HURD for his leadership not only on this. but on so many important topics here in this body. He certainly is looking after transparency and oversight on behalf of the American people. I just would like to applaud his leadership there. [ 1630 I am proud today. Mr. Speaker. to rise in support of S. 2133. the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015. S. 2133 is a bipartisan bill that will provide agencies a critically important measure for defeating fraud and protecting taxpayer dollars. In fiscal year 2014. the GAO reported that a significant portion of the $124 billion in improper payments were related to fraud. To make matters worse. all the improper payments increased by a total of $19 billionthat is billion with a Bfrom the previous fiscal year. Given the cost of these improper payments to agencies and. as a result. to the taxpayers. something must be done to block the flow of these fraudulent and improper payments. S. 2133 will provide the necessary framework around which agencies can build a strong antifraud defense system. Currently. agencies have been overreliant on an afterthefact antifraud detection measure which requires the agency to review payments after they have been made and then make an attempt to recoup them. S. 2113 actually would require these agencies to develop proactive measures to identify risk. to analyze known cases of fraud. and then to develop strategies to prevent future fraud. It will also protect the American taxpayer dollars from fraud by requiring agencies to better share data that can be used to fight fraud. This bill will create a working group of agencies where best practices and fraud detection and prevention strategies can be shared throughout the government. By combating fraud. agencies will not only protect taxpayer dollars. but also increase the trust and confidence in the administration of government programs. I would like to thank Senator CARPER and Senator TILLIS for introducing this important. goodgovernment legislation. and I urge my colleagues to support this bill and help better protect the American taxpayer dollars by voting in favor of S. 2133.

1140030204,Mr. Chairman. I plan to withdraw this amendment. but I would like the opportunity to briefly explain. The SaltonstallKennedy Act of 1954 imposed a special duty on fish and fish products imported into the United States and required that 30 percent of the money collected by NOAA would go toward supporting fisheries and research and development on the industrys longterm sustainability. However. NOAA has not been properly paying into its regional fishing grant programs and is using these tariffs as part of its operational expenses. To ensure a thriving fishing industry. we must invest in initiatives that increase the stock of our Nations fisheries by providing grants to research and monitor them as well as management programs. During my first term. I introduced legislation that would ensure that key programs critical to sustainably managing ocean fish populations and the fishermen and communities that depend on them would receive increased and sustained funding. I sincerely thank Chairman CULBERSON for considering my appropriations letter and including the transfer of $130 million in existing funds to be used exclusively on SaltonstallKennedy fishing activity. particularly the SK regional fisheries investment grant program. This transfer of funds will directly provide grants to regional fishery management councils that would work with area fishermen to identify investment priorities. These investment priorities include disaster assistance. improving shoreside infrastructure. seafood promotion. and managing highly migratory species. The transfer of these funds will help. however. it is a temporary fix to a much larger issue. This year. I. along with my friend Congressman BILL KEATING. have introduced the same legislation that would ensure that NOAA follow the requirement laid out in the SaltonstallKennedy Act of 1954. Again. I want to thank Chairman CULBERSON for taking my letter and thoughts into consideration. I appreciate the hard work of the committee on this issue and the bill. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140063514,for bringing this bill forward. Mr. Chairman. ever since the CFPB introduced its 2013 bulletin on indirect auto lending. the need for this legislation has been clear. First. the CFPB issued its bulletin in order to get around the rulemaking process for indirect auto lending. This kind of guidance is traditionally used as a mere restatement of law or to provide further explanation of rulemaking. It is not traditionally used to make a major policy like fundamentally altering the auto loan market. Second. it is clear that the CFPB is unwilling to publish online all of the data and assumptions it has relied upon for this guidance. Providing these details should be an obvious and easy step to implement for any credible government agency. Unfortunately. because the CFPB is not subject to the appropriations process. they seem unwilling to comply with even the most commonsense oversight by Congress. Therefore. H.R. 1737 is necessary to require the CFPB to provide for a notice and comment period before it can reissue any related guidance. Mr. Chairman. this compromise legislation represents fair and reasonable adjustments to the CFPBs regulatory guidance process intended to promote transparency and accountability for regulators. This legislation is truly a bipartisan effort that was supported in committee by 13 Members on the minority side of the aisle. I am also glad to see widespread support for this legislation from a range of groups. including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. the National Automobile Dealers Association. the national RV Dealers Association. the Independent Community Bankers Association. and the Credit Union National Association. Mr. Chairman. last year I was proud to introduce legislation similar to Mr. GUINTAs after hearing from so many auto dealers in my State the frustrations they had with this particular rule. I am proud to support this legislation. and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help us promote greater transparency and accountability and bring common sense back to the marketplace. Again. I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire .
1140071330,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to join bipartisan Members. Republicans and Democrats from around the country. to talk about heroin use. an increasingly deadly public health crisis. I welcome Kriss and Mark from New Hampshire. who are here today to honor the life of Marks daughter. A special thankyou to Congresswoman ANN KUSTER. my fellow Granite Stater and partner on our Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. We formed this task force last year to bring attention to opiate addiction and overdose spreading nationwide. Now over 40 House Members have joined our task force and this cause. We aim to inform not just members of the public. but the Nation about the tragedies and the challenges that face our families. our communities. our States. our loved ones. and our friends. We are here not just to combat this epidemic. but bring solutions not just to this body. but to every area of the Nation. Congresswoman KUSTER and I have held a roundtable with addiction and law enforcement experts in Concord. New Hampshire. our home State. We held a subsequent policy briefing in Washington. D.C.. featuring officials from the Drug Enforcement Agency. Centers for Disease Control. and other Federal agencies. They are providing a fuller picture of the scope of the problem. which in New Hampshire has claimed 400 lives in 2015. To put that figure in perspective. 1 out of every 3.000 people have died of a heroin overdose just last year. The CDC reports that. nationally. overdose deaths have tripled over the last 10 years. These numbers. unfortunately. are likely to rise. But numbers dont tell the whole story. To truly illustrate the dangers of heroin use. we need to hear from fathers like Doug Griffin of Newton in New Hampshires First Congressional District. At a forum yesterday in Manchester. New Hampshire. where I proudly served as mayor. he told the audience about his daughter Courtney. who fell victim to heroin at just 20 years young. Doug remembers his daughter as an exuberant young girl who had a great sense of humor and a passion for life until a mix of prescription pills. fentanyl. and street heroin ensnared Courtneylike millions of other Americansin a fatal web of addiction. Before the drugs overcame her. she played music and she loved smores. She wanted to be a marine and trained for it. But just 3 years later. Courtney was lost on the streets. in and out of rehab facilities. She no longer had the will to live. Because Courtneys situation was so dire. because it seemed like they had so few options. Doug said he and his family hid the truth from the outside world. Bravely. Doug is now telling everyone he knows about the warning signs of heroin addiction and deficiencies in our public response. Tonight is about telling the truth in order to build momentum towards better solutions. It is about putting political disagreements aside. because the heroin epidemic crosses party lines. It crosses every congressional district in the United States. The truth is addiction strikes every demographic and every geographic region. There are too many stories like Courtneys. However. we also have a wealth of ideas to combat this problem. Congresswoman KUSTER and I formed the Bipartisan Task Force to gather those stories and ideas and assemble them into effective legislation. We introduced the STOP ABUSE Act as the first order of business to coordinate law enforcement and public health agencies at the Federal. State. and local levels. The bill targets highintensity drug trafficking areas for special attention. Newton. New Hampshire. where Doug Griffins daughter died of an overdose. lies on such a route just north of the Massachusetts border.
1140090153,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of this legislation. the Good Samaritan Assessment Act of This legislation simply directs the GAO to study State and local Good Samaritan laws that protect caregivers. law enforcement personnel. and first responders who administer opioid overdose reversal drugs or devices. as well as those who contact emergency service providers in response to an overdose from civil or criminal liability. A Good Samaritan law offers legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are or who they believe to be injured. ill. or otherwise incapacitated. These laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally they prevent an individual who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued or prosecuted for wrongdoing. Their purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help an individual in need for fear of legal repercussions. This legislation is crucial toward understanding which Good Samaritan laws are working well to provide a framework for others to follow. In my home State of New Hampshire. last year we had 430 people die from a drugrelated overdose. The number continues to climb because the coroners office has not concluded the autopsies from last year. Imagine a family member who is trying to grieve over their loved one who had the illness of addiction and somebody stood over that body and was afraid to help. I think that this legislation is important. and I am glad that it is striking a bipartisan tone. because this is about saving lives. This is about providing assistance to those who are in moments of deepest despair in their life. I work on this issue not just on behalf of my constituents and the 50.000 people across the country who have passed due to this sickness. but I also do it in the name of my friend. Abi Lizotte. who is a survivor. who is 8 months clean. with a 6month old child. who testified at a hearing in New Hampshire about the possibility of success because she had somebody who assisted her. This addiction has ripped the country apart. We have an obligation as a Congress to act. and I am so pleased with the leadership of Chairman GOODLATTE and so many Republicans and Democrats who have shared the same hope and understanding that life is worth fighting for. So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I appreciate the committees work. the chairmans work. the bipartisan work.
1140090251,Mr. Speaker. I thank Congresswoman CLARK for yielding. and I extend my gratitude to her for joining me tonight in this Special Order. I am also grateful for the opportunity to join bipartisan membersRepublican and Democratfrom around the country to talk about heroin abuse. an increasingly deadly public health crisis. Last year I joined with my colleague from New Hampshire. Congresswoman KUSTER. to create The Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. We strive to fight the tragedy of opioid addiction and fatal overdose from around the Nation. Since its creation last October. our task force has grown to 80 members. Our growth and impact is a testament to the depth of the crisis and the focus of the Members of this body. In my home State of New Hampshire. abuse and overdose claimed the lives of 430 people in 2015. To put that number in perspective. that is 1 out of every 3.000 residents died of an overdose last year. The CDC reports that. nationally. overdose deaths have tripled over the last 10 years. I am proud of the work we have done so far to combat this epidemic. But as many struggling families and ailing communities know. there is much more work to be done. A few weeks ago the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic proposed a legislative agenda. Our bills would assist law enforcement. treatment providers. and recovery personnel in their battle against the epidemic. During this Heroin and Opioid Awareness Week. we will see our legislation come to the floor for a vote. I am pleased that my colleagues have tirelessly worked to protect our loved ones from this epidemic. and I am proud to cosponsor many bills coming to the floor this week. including the House response to the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. To address the comprehensive nature of this epidemic. we must provide a comprehensive legislative package to bolster the efforts of those helping our communities. I have filed several amendments to this package for this week. They will increase grants for medicationassisted treatments and longterm recovery. I also have filed legislation that would reauthorize recovery court programs for 3 years. and I am grateful that my bill. the Good Samaritan Assessment Act of 2016. passed by suspension in the House earlier today. I hope this provision will be included in the conference report. Very simply. these provisions are absolutely crucial to aiding those in need. My colleagues and I have committed to seeing the House of Representatives pass the strongest and most comprehensive plan possible. I believe we will do our due diligence to pass this plan. go to conference with the Senate. and put a bill on the Presidents desk before June. Our plan is urgently needed. Nearly 129 people die every day from an opioid overdose. In my district and around the country. I hear from families and friends who know someone coping with substance use disorder. We will only make a dent in this great challenge by listening to its victims. We need to hear fathers like Doug Griffin of Newton in New Hampshires First District. His daughter. Courtney. fell victim to heroin abuse at just 20 years old. Doug remembers Courtney as a bright. lively girl with a great sense of humor and a deep passion for life. She played music. She loved smores. Courtney told Doug she planned to become a marine and serve her country. But 3 years later she was lost on the streets. in and out of rehab facilities. Prescription pills. fentanyl. and street heroin ensnared Courtney into a fatal web of addiction. She lost the will to live. Because Courtneys pain was so great and because she had so few options for treatment. Doug says he and his family hid the truth from the outside world. To help others. they are speaking out now. just as this body is this evening. Doug is courageously telling everyone he knows about the warning signs of heroin abuse and the deficiencies in our public response. Millions of Americans share Courtneys story and Dougs anguish. It is only by speaking out and sharing grief that we will remove the stigma preventing far too many from seeking help. Tonight it is about telling the truth. It is about finding the solutions we need and why we need them. It is about putting political disagreements aside and cooperating for the common good. for the common good not just of our constituents. but our country. As the House considers this vital legislation. I encourage my colleagues to listen to their constituents. hear their stories. share their struggles. and help them fight back. We could win this public emergency. and it starts this week with the comprehensive CARA legislation. I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for working so judiciously and in a manner that I think puts people ahead of anything else that this body is doing. I commend my colleagues. and I am honored to work with them on this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I thank the congresswoman from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to the south of my district.
1140090298,"for his leadership and to everyone who participated tonight. The idea behind a Special Order to put a face on this terrible heroin epidemic and addiction. generally. is to create compassion and empathy both among our colleagues and for those of you who may be watching at home. We need a societal change in the way we approach substance use disorder. We need to understand that this is a disease. I say at home. frequently. every time you hear the word ""addict."" think of the word ""diabetic."" We dont say to someone: We cant treat you because you have just eaten cake. Essentially. we say: That is a really hard disease for you to live with. and we want to help you. That is the message that we want to convey tonight to families in New Hampshire and all across this country. We want to be a part of the solution. and that is going to include prevention. education. treatment. access to treatment. expanding access to treatment. and then lifelong recovery. We know that the brain changes under the misuse of prescription drugs or opiates or heroin. and we need to have the patience to help people get through not just the treatment itself. but the recovery period. We need homes where people can live in a substancefree environment. and we need supports and mental health supports. We have learned that four out of five heroin users have a cooccurring mental health issue typically untreated and typically not getting any kind of help with that. So in a sense. what you have are people that are selfmedicating. We also know that four out of five heroin users are coming to this through prescription medication. so we need to reach out and work with our healthcare providers. I am very proud that both the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association are supporting many of the bills that we have coming forward on the floor this week. So this is the beginning. Our work is not done. but the message tonight is that Congress is coming together in a bipartisan way to tackle this headon. to help these families. to help people get treatment. and to put an end to this terrible. terrible disease. I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire."
1140090299,I want to thank the gentlewoman. my colleague from our State of New Hampshire. where. unfortunately. last year. 430 people perished due to opioid abuse and addiction. That is 1 out of every 3.000 of our residents. It is a significant challenge in our State. in the Northeast. and New England. but all across the country. Almost 50.000 people. last year. died of this epidemic. It is not just an epidemic. but an emergency. one that I believe this Congress is firmly standing strong in a bipartisan way to find solutions. to do our part at the Federal level to make sure that we have every opportunity not just to help those who seek treatment and recovery. but also to strengthen law enforcement. to focus on those individuals who are selling these drugs across the country. from California to New Hampshire. but also being proactive in prevention and in education. We often speak of our friends and constituents in New Hampshire that continue to suffer. but we also talk about our children. I have a 12yearold and an 11yearold that I hope will live lives without and free from drugs. I want to make sure that every seventhand eighthgrader in the State of New Hampshire understands the severity of the problem and understands that this is something that is deadly that we cannot even take once. As you mentioned. the challenge of fentanyl. lacing a pill of heroin with as many as three small pieces of fentanyl the size of grains of sand can kill a person. Most people dont realize that. This is a deadly. deadly epidemic. [ 2100 This week the House of Representatives takes up a whole host of bills. After the Senate passed their CARA Act 941. we have had four committees of jurisdiction work and try to improve that piece of legislation. I look forward to sharing a very strong bipartisan vote this week on a whole host of bills. going to conference with the Senate. and getting this bill to the Presidents desk. It is a mark of bipartisanship and it is a mark of leadership. something that the country needs to see from this institution and from this city. I want to thank all of my colleagues who participated in this Special Order tonight to kick off Heroin and Opioid Awareness Week. We have heard stories of success and difficulty come in equal measure from every corner of the country. I commend the House for passing a comprehensive bipartisan bill for the relief of the vulnerable. the victimized. and distressed in my district. in your district. and throughout the Nation. Any measure we take to lighten even slightly the burden of suffering patients and families can make the difference between fatal despair and renewal. The House is scheduled to take up several similar measures this week. It is my hope that. when combined. our efforts will begin to form a solution to this harrowing and tragic national crisis. We will continue to work for safe communities and effective evidencebased treatments. But I want to end this evening on a favorable note. I want to share the story of my friend. Abi Lizotte. who the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Congresswoman KUSTER. knows all too well. Abi Lizotte last year had been addicted to heroin for an extended period of time and had nowhere left to turn. Her family wouldnt help her. Her friends wouldnt help her. Even the people she bought drugs from wouldnt help her. She was 8 months pregnant. She finally called a nurse. a nurse that had helped her earlier in the year. and asked for assistance. She went to the hospital and thankfully was able to see a physician. That physician told her that she was days away from dying while she was carrying her child. Thankfully. through the grace of God and the help of people in New Hampshire. she was able to start the process of recovery. Today my friend Abiand I am proud to call her my friendhas testified in front of our committee hearings in New Hampshire. has testified about the experience that she had and the loneliness and despair that she experienced. She is now 6 months clean with an 8monthold son named Parker. It is a story of success. She continues each and every day to strive for that success for others. She actually goes to schools in New Hampshire and speaks to kids about her experience in the hope that other people will not fall to the same experience she had over the last several years. I count her as a friend. but I focus our work in her name. just as you focus your work in the name of Kriss Soterians stepdaughter. Amber. because these are people we know. These are people that we dont just represent. They are people that we want to try to save. I am very. very happy to see our leadership. the bipartisanship this week in the legislation that will come to this floor. and I pray that next year we dont see the same number of deaths. that we start to see a decline. But. regardless. this is just the beginning of this process where we will continue to fight for every life. to fight for every person who is dealing with the disease of addiction. and will continue to work in a bipartisan way because people of our Nation deserve it. I want to thank my colleague again. ANN KUSTER from New Hampshire. my cochair of the bipartisan task force. for her leadership. I thank the speakers this evening. I look forward to a productive week and a productive year. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140090541,Mr. Speaker. I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 5046. the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act. and H.R. 4641. which will establish an interagency task force to review. modify. and update best practices for pain management and prescription pain medication. Overprescription of opioids is leading to addiction. shattering lives. and creating death around our country. In my home State of New Hampshire. deadly overdoses following the abuse of heroin and opioids claimed the lives of over 430 people last year alone. That is about 1 in every 3.000 people from my State falling victim to an epidemic. succumbing to a preventable problem. According to the CDC. overdose deaths have tripled over the last 10 years. Desperate families. too long. are crying out for help. I commend my colleagues for rising to the occasion in this legislative response. tackling this issue in a bipartisan way. and making the proper commitment to fund an adequate response to help those who are in need. These two pieces of legislation are designed to assist those battling the epidemic on the front lines. from law enforcement officers to underfunded recovery systems and personnel. and everyone in between. I am moved time and time again by the painful stories of the victims and courageous individuals coming to their aid. and I urge the House to offer its support in this struggle. I was pleased that just last night the Committee on Rules accepted my amendment. allowing prevention and recovery programs to accept grant money authorized by the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act. and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when it comes to the House floor tomorrow. As the House response to the Senatepassed Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. these bills are a joint step toward progress and safety. I am a proud sponsor of many of these bills coming to the floor this week. and I hope for their swift and timely passage as urgent relief for those who are suffering around our Nation. We must provide a thorough and wideranging plan to meet the enormity of this terrible epidemic. which invades every corner of the United States. takes lives across traditional divides. and manifests itself in ways to which we are not accustomed. My colleagues and I are committed to seeing the House of Representatives answer this challenge by passing the most vigorous and inclusive plan possible. I am confident we will do all that we can to pass this plan this week. go to conference with the Senate. and put a bill on the Presidents desk before June. Our plan is urgently needed. Almost 130 people die every day from opioid overdoses. Eighty percent of the opioids prescribed worldwide are prescribed here in the United States. In my district and around the country. I hear from families and friends who know someone coping with substance use disorder. We will only make a dent in this great challenge by listening to its victims. We need to listen to fathers like Doug Griffin of Newton. New Hampshire. His daughter Courtney fell victim to heroin abuse at 20 years old. Doug remembers Courtney as a vivacious girl. funny. passionate. and charming. She loved music and smores and told Doug she planned to become a marine. a beautiful young woman prepared to sacrifice for her country in one of its greatest and most honorable services. That was Courtney. But 3 years later. she was lost on the streets. overwhelmed by the sorrow and confusion this epidemic instills. moving from rehab facility to rehab facility. Prescription pills. fentanyl. and street heroin ensnared Courtney in a fatal web of addiction. and she lost the will to live. Courtney was a 20yearold girl20 years olda neighbor. a friend. a daughter. How can we begin to comprehend the depth of that kind of tragedy? Because Courtneys pain was so great and because she had so few options for treatment. Doug says he and his family hid the truth from the outside world. To help others. they are speaking out now. and by speaking out and listening. we start to understand this tragedy. Doug is courageously telling everyone he knows the warning signs of heroin abuse and the deficiencies in our public response. Millions of Americans share Courtneys story and Dougs anguish. It is only by speaking out and sharing grief that we will remove the stigma preventing far too many from seeking help. This week. during Heroin and Opioid Abuse Awareness Week. we have an opportunity to hear. learn. share. and fight back. We can hear the stories of grieving and resolute families. the stories of resilient victims. We can learn of the intensity of their experiences and glean from them the lessons we need to fight back. We can share their lessons and bring them to bear in our discourse and through our legislation. and we can start to turn the tide. As the House considers this vital legislation. I encourage my colleagues to listen to their constituents. hear their stories. share their struggles. and help them fight back.
1140091260,Mr. Chairman. I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 5046. the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act. which will provide more effective cooperation between our law enforcement and treatment agencies. grow our treatment capabilities. and strengthen programs for training and veterans. This bill is an important step in combating the growing costs of the terrible opioid epidemic. Just last year. in my home State of New Hampshire. deadly overdoses following the abuse of heroin killed over 430 people. That staggering figure marks the rising toll of this epidemic. I commend my colleagues for offering this legislation as part of the response to the epidemic and as part of a wider plan moving through the House this week. This bill aims to bring sorely needed resources to different groups and agencies working to help families and individuals in need. sometimes in desperate need. For too long. too many of those helping our sons and daughters and our veterans have been underfunded in their efforts. This week we have heard and shared stories of people suffering from this epidemic all over the country. These stories help us draft and pass effective response to the needs of our communities. We know that no one bill or amendment on its own is equal to the massive scale of this epidemic. but together they can begin to address some of its worst effects and harshest consequences. We need to incorporate the best practices that have emerged across disciplines and different agencies. and we need to ensure cooperation between actors on the ground. As part of the House response to the Senatepassed Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. this bill represents our commitment to restoring hope in shattered communities. I have been a proud sponsor of many of the bills coming forward this week. and I am pleased that so many have passed and many more are expected to pass today. We provide a cohesive. unified. and farreaching legislative package to meet the enormity of this epidemic. and I believe we have begun to move in that direction. I thank my colleagues for their dedication and tireless work to support this effort. I particularly want to commend Chairman GOODLATTE on his leadership and his efforts as we continue to help and provide hope for people not just in New Hampshire. but all across the country.

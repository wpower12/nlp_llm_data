1140044780,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3009. the Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act. This thoroughly flawed measure is a blatant attempt by most of the majority to insert its antiimmigrant status agenda into local policing initiatives. It does this by prohibiting State and local governments from receiving critical criminal justice funds if they have policies that prioritize public safety and community policing over Federal immigration enforcement. The bill absolutely makes no sense because. rather than improving public safety. it will achieve the complete opposite. and that is not just my conclusion. Law enforcement agencies from across the United States and numerous organizationssuch as the Major County Sheriffs Association. the Fraternal Order of Police. the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force. the United States Conference of Mayors. and the National League of Citiesall oppose this bill. In effect. this bill would punish law enforcement officers by withholding the funds they need to do their jobs. and it would require States and localities to prioritize Federal immigration enforcement ahead of enhancing public safety. Reactionary proposals such as this legislation will only make our communities less safe because immigrants will not report crimes or otherwise cooperate with the police if they fear they or their family members may be asked for their immigration status. As a result. crimes will go unsolved and unpunished while criminals are free to victimize more people. In addition. withholding crucial United States Department of Justice funds from local communities will not lower crime. Studies have demonstrated that these programs. particularly the COPS and Byrne JAG funds. provide crucial support services to fight criminal activity. but a vote for H.R. 3009 is a vote to take these funds away and to risk making communities less safe. All of us. on both sides of the aisle. are opposed to violent crime. There is simply no debate about that. Not one of us would condone what happened to Kate Steinle in San Francisco. but H.R. 3009 is simply the wrong approach. I agree with the Major Cities Chiefs Association that the best way to reduce crime in their cities is to gain the communitys trust and cooperation. I also believe that the majority of immigrants in this country are hardworking. lawabiding residents. and comprehensive immigration reform would allow these lawabiding individuals to come out of the shadows and get right with the law. Such legislative reform would enable Immigration and Customs Enforcement to focus its limited resources on deporting the worst elements. while ensuring that our entire community. citizens and immigrants alike. are protected from harm. Instead of considering this commonsense solution. the majoritymost of themhave repeatedly voted to deport DREAMers. to deport the parents of United States citizens. and to deport vulnerable children from fleeing persecution. violence. and trafficking. Now. the majority. in the form of H.R. 3009. asks us to override the public safety mission of State and local enforcement agencies to increase deportations. I strenuously urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous legislation. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140050663,"Mr. Speaker. I oppose H.R. 758. the ""Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2015."" This bill is substantially identical to bills that we considered in the 112th and 113th Congresses. and we have considered even earlier versions of this bill going back at least a decade. H.R. 758. like its predecessors. is a solution in search of a problem that would threaten to do more harm than good if enacted. H.R. 758 would restore the 1983 version of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by making sanctions for Rule 11 violations mandatory and by eliminating the current safeharbor provision that allows a party to withdraw or correct any allegedly offending submission to the court within 21 days after service of such submission. Moreover. the bill would go beyond the 1983 Rule by requiring a court to award reasonable attorneys fees and costs related to Rule 11 litigation. Current Rule 11 makes such awards entirely discretionary. Yet no empirical evidence suggests any need for a change to the current Rule 11. In fact. there were good reasons why the Judicial Conference of the United States amended the 1983 version of Rule 11. For these same reasons. H.R. 758 is illadvised. The 1983 Rule caused excessive litigation. Many civil cases had a parallel track of litigationreferred to as ""satellite litigation""-over Rule 11 violations because having mandatory sanctions and no safeharbor provision caused parties on both sides of a Rule 11 motion to litigate the Rule 11 matter to the bitter end. The dramatic increase in litigation spawned by the 1983 Rule not only resulted in delays in resolving the underlying case and increased costs for the litigants. but also strained judicial resources. In light of this history. it is clear that H.R. 758 will result in more. not less. litigation and will impose a great burden on the federal judiciary. Ultimately. the type of Rule 11 sanctions regime that H.R. 758 envisions will only favor those with the money and resources to fight expensive and drawn out litigation battles. H.R. 758 also threatens judicial independence by removing the discretion that Rule 11 currently gives judges in determining whether to impose sanctions and what type of sanctions would be most appropriate. It also circumvents the painstakingly thorough Rules Enabling Act process. recklessly attempting to amend the rules directly. even over the Judicial Conferences objections. Finally. we know that the 1983 Rule had a disproportionately chilling impact on civil rights cases. and there is no reason to think H.R. 758 would not have a similar chilling effect if it is enacted. Civil rights cases in particular depend on novel arguments for the extension. modification. or reversal of existing law. Not surprisingly. a Federal Judicial Center study found that the incidence of Rule 11 motions was higher in civil rights cases than some other types of cases when the 1983 Rule was in place. notwithstanding the fact that the 1983 Rule was neutral on its face. Even the decision in Brown v. Board of Education arguably may have been delayed or stopped had H.R. 758s changes to Rule 11 been in effect at the time. given the novel nature of the plaintiffs arguments in that case. At a minimum. the defendants could have used Rule 11. as amended by H.R. 758. as a weapon to dissuade the plaintiffs or weaken their resolve. H.R. 758 is a flawed bill for many reasons. I would urge my colleagues to oppose it."
1140074068,"Mr. Speaker. the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther Kings vision of ending inequality through providing jobs. justice. and peace to all Americans is a vision that many have fought and died to make a reality. As the Civil Rights Movement battled against discrimination and inequality in the 1960s. I adopted Dr. Kings vision of jobs. justice. and peace when I ran for Congress in 1964. I remember the Jim Crow era. poll taxes. and institutionalized segregation when I arrived in Congress. Yet. for all of these institutional scars and discriminatory impediments. the work we did in Congress aided in fulfilling the promises of equality enshrined in our Constitution. After a historic effort. the Civil Rights Act was passed. the Voting Rights Act was adopted. and a new era of federal protections around equality was ushered in the 20th Century. Some fifty years later. this era has yet to be fully realized. While the initial challenges of recognizing and upholding civil rights have been met. many of the original problems persist. but in an evolved form. Fifty plus years later. the American people confront issues of voter suppression. gender and sexual orientation discrimination. Many communities feel under siege from those sworn to protect their liberty. Hate crimes and religious intolerance are on the rise as reported nightly on the news. And women contend with a pay inequity hampering their standing with men in the workplace. In spite of all of these shortcomings. strides have been made: reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act in 2006. the passage of legislation expanding access to healthcare. the introduction of legislation combating voter caging and deceptive practices. and the passage of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. signed into law by the first AfricanAmerican President of the United States. himself emblematic of civil rights progress. These issues were all. at one point in time. deemed radical. Womens suffrage. racial equality. and now gay and lesbian rights: for each. the civil rights movement has expanded until true justice is achieved. Many problems persist and more are certain to arrive. but through renewed determination to tackle these deepseated problems. we can one day live up to the beloved community envision by Dr. King. While our struggle for equality stems from being afforded the basic human rights associated with a free society. the ideal of achieving economic justice. with employment for all who seek it. remains out of reach for many. The aftermath of the financial crisis has brought crippling unemployment. wage stagnation. and rising income inequality. Yet. the Great Recession has only exacerbated a decadeslong decline in the fortunes of the working and middle classes. As finances continue to deteriorate. basic social and public services have often been the first to go. In the realm of healthcare. a basic safety net was only recently afforded to the underserved in the United States with passage of the Affordable Care Act. yet millions of lowincome and unemployed individuals remain uninsured. Housing remains a continued blight. as massforeclosures following the aftermath of the Great Recession tear apart communities and destabilizes families. Even after fifty years of promoting Dr. Kings cause for peace. our country is enmeshed in gun violence. which tragically produced the shootings in Newtown. Aurora. Tucson. and Wisconsin. and daily on the streets of Americas most populated cities. These horrific occurrences are unacceptable for our nation. which is why catapulting peace to the forefront of our nations agenda will save lives and protect our most vital right under the Constitution: life. I am hopeful that by strengthening our gun laws we can remove military style weapons out of our communities. prohibit the sale of deadly gun clips. and close loopholes on the sale of guns. Our rate of incarceration and length of sentences are unjust and unsustainable. The United States incarcerates 25 percent of the worlds prisoners. while we have only five percent of the worlds population. And we disproportionately prosecute and incarcerate African Americans more than any other race. This is the result of what President Obama has called a ""huge explosion"" in our incarceration rates. with 500.000 people imprisoned in America in 1980 growing to 2.2 million today. We must change our prosecution policies and sentencing laws to address this crisis. and I am working with my colleagues to do that. The profiling of racial and religious minorities is also a terrible reality that threatens peace in our nation. Profiling is an archaic form of discrimination that subjects individuals to criminal indictments or investigations based on their race or religion. Although profiling cannot be found in any form of written law. the practice is real in America and threatens the trust and peace that is essential in the relationship between citizens and their law enforcement. Our nations leaders can work to pass legislation. such as the End Racial Profiling Act. to prohibit this practice in any law enforcement agency and the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act to provide real standards for the operation of police departments. As we press forward to address inequality in the 21st Century. the outstanding question is whether or not Congress will rise to tackle these issues. The American people have already witnessed how politics can transform our legislative body into a body producing nothing but dysfunction. However. the erosion of Congresss focus on protecting civil rights and civil liberties can be reversed. This Congress has the opportunity to answer these present injustices by assuming the unwavering commitment to jobs. justice. and peace that was displayed so valiantly by Dr. Martin Luther King. Ending inequality in America is a battle that can be won. and although the enemy is still the same. our approach in the 21st century must not lack the strength and courage of those who have fought so bravely before us."
1140083602,"Mr. Speaker. H.R. 2745. the ""Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015"" or SMARTER Act. would require the Federal Trade Commission to use the same merger enforcement procedures as the Justice Departments Antitrust Division for proposed mergers. acquisitions. joint ventures. and other similar transactions. I oppose this flawed bill for several reasons. Most importantly. H.R. 2745by weakening the Commissions independenceundermines Congresss original intent in creating the Federal Trade Commission in the first place. For good reasons that are still relevant today. Congress established the Commission to be an independent administrative agency. Although the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 empowered the Justice Department to enforce antitrust laws. Congress determined that more needed to be done to address the wave of mergers and anticompetitive corporate abuses that continued notwithstanding the enactment of that Act. Accordingly. Congress created the Commission in 1914 as an independent body of experts charged with developing antitrust law and policy free from political influence. and particularly executive branch interference. To this end. Congress specifically gave the Commission broad administrative powers to investigate and enforce laws to stop unfair methods of competition as well as the authority to use an administrative adjudication process to develop policy expertise. rather than requiring the Commission to try cases before a generalist federal judge. Yet. rather than strengthening the Commissions independence and enforcement authority. the SMARTER Act does the opposite. Of greatest concern is the bills elimination of the administrative adjudication process for merger cases under section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. By doing so. the SMARTER Act would effectively transform the Commission from an independent administrative agency into just another competition enforcement agency indistinguishable from the Justice Department and. thereby. arguable redundant. The Commissions administrative authority is key to its distinctive role as an independent administrative agency. But the SMARTER Actby eliminating the Commissions administrative authorityopens the door for the ultimate elimination of the Commission. And. you do not just have to take my word for it. Former Republican Commission Chairman William Kovacic. while expressing support for the bills harmonization of preliminary injunction standards. says that the ""rest of the SMARTER Act is rubbish."" He continued. ""Let me put it this way: behind the rest of [the SMARTER Act] is the fundamental question of whether you want the Federal Trade Commission involved in competition law."" Similarly. current Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez observes that the bill would have ""farreaching immediate effects"" and ""fundamentally alter the nature and function of the Commission. as well as the potential for significant unintended consequences."" Consumers Union also opposes the SMARTER Act not only because it is completely unnecessary. but also because the bill could ""create unintended hurdles to effective and sound enforcement"" and ""set the stage for further tinkeringboth of which risk undermining what is now a coherent. consistent. wellestablished. familiar enforcement procedure within the"" Commission. Finally. the SMARTER Act is problematic because it may apply to conduct wellbeyond large mergers. which could further hinder the Commissions effectiveness. In particular. the SMARTER Act would eliminate the Commissions authority to use administrative adjudications not just for the largest mergers. but for nonmerger activity. like a ""joint venture"" or ""similar transaction."" I recognize that the bills authors have tried in good faith to respond to some of the concerns expressed by me and by the Commission during the last Congress and I appreciate those efforts. Moreover. I recognize that the Commission itself last year changed its procedural rules to make it easier to end the use of administrative litigation where it loses a preliminary injunction proceeding in court. I continue to have concerns. however. about the bills prohibition against the Commissions administrative litigation authority with respect to all merger cases. Accordingly. I must oppose the SMARTER Act. even in its rewritten form. and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to H.R."
1140086520,Madam Speaker. I rise to implore the Senate to fulfill its responsibility and give fair consideration to President Obamas nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. During my tenure in this honorable body. I have witnessed no comparable examples of partisan politics and complete obstructionism with respect to the consideration of a Supreme Court nominee. I introduced H. Res. 661. together with my Democratic colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee. This resolution calls on the Senate to hold hearings and an upordown vote on the Presidents nomination of Judge Garland. The Senate majoritys flatout refusal to consider President Obamas nominee. regardless of the nominees qualifications. is historically unprecedented and is part of a longstanding pattern of disrespect shown to this administration in particular. Our Constitution relies on a system of checks and balances. yet the Senate majoritys continued stonewalling of the Presidents nominee threatens to throw the system into an imbalance. The President. of course. has the constitutional authority and obligation to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court. pursuant to Article II. section 2. and he has fulfilled his duty with his nomination of Judge Garland. The Senate has both the authority and the duty to provide advice and consent on the Presidents nominee. yet the Senate has. thus far. refused to do its job. which is simply unacceptable. It is clear the Constitution requires that both the President and the Senate fulfill their respective roles in the Supreme Court nomination process in order for the Supreme Court to be able to fully perform its constitutional role. Otherwise. what is to stop the Senate from grinding the Courta coequal branch of government. I remind youto a halt by simply refusing to consider any nominees to fill any vacancies on the Court? There is no merit to their argument that we have to wait until we elect a new President. After all. the American people twice elected President Obama to fulfill the duties of President. including the duty to appoint Supreme Court Justices. A strong and independent judiciary is a prerequisite for a strong democracy. This remains as true in the last year of a Presidency as it does in the first. Moreover. there is ample precedent for Presidents nominating and the Senate confirming Supreme Court nominees in a Presidential election year. For example. in 1988. during the last full year of Ronald Reagans Presidency. the Democraticcontrolled Senate confirmed the nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy by President Reagan by a vote of 970. There are 9 months left in President Obamas term. The President has nominated an eminently qualified jurist in Judge Garland. and the Senate has more than enough time to consider and vote on his nomination. It is vital that the Supreme Court have a full complement of Justices so that the critical constitutional and legal questions before the Court can be given the full attention they need. Already. we have seen a number of 44 decisions that have left much uncertainty in place for the lower courts. for the litigants. and for Americans generally. The Senate should do its job: comply with regular order. hold hearings on Judge Garlands nomination. and then have an upordown vote on the nomination. Now it is with great pleasure that I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
1140088714,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. In 2014. in a unanimous ruling delivered by Chief Justice Roberts. the Supreme Court concluded that the police may not search a cell phone without first demonstrating probable cause. Citing an obvious Fourth Amendment interest in the vast amount of data we store on our personal devices. the Court wrote: ""The fact that technology now allows an individual to carry such information in his hand does not make the information any less worthy of the protection for which the Founders fought. Our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simpleget a warrant."" With that decision. the Court took a bold step toward reconciling the Fourth Amendment with the advent of modern communications technology. Today. the House takes a similar step to reconcile our interests in privacy and due process with the realities of modern computing. H.R. 699. the Email Privacy Act. recognizes that the content of our communications. although often stored in digital format. remains worthy of Fourth Amendment protection. And to the investigators and government agents who seek access to our email. our advice is accordingly simple: Get a warrant. It is an idea whose time has long since come. This bill will allow us to move to a clear. uniform standard for law enforcement agencies to access the content of our communications. namely. a warrant based on probable cause. H.R. 699 also codifies the right of the providers to give notice of this intrusion to their customers. except in certain exigent circumstances that must also be validated by the court. We should note the absence of a special carveout from the warrant requirement for the civil agencies. like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. In the House Judiciary Committee. we reached quick consensus that a civil carveout of any kind is unworkable. unconstitutional. or both. I would have preferred to have kept the notice provisions of the original bill. which are absent from the version we reported from committee. In the digital world. no amount of due diligence necessarily tells us that the government has accessed our electronic communications. The government should have an obligation to provide us with some form of notice when intruding on a record of our most private conversations. but I understand that not everyone shares this view. and I am willing to compromise. for now. in order to advance the important reforms that we will adopt today. I am proud of the work we have done. This legislation is several years in the making. and it should not be delayed any further. I compliment our colleague Mr. POLIS. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 699. the Email Privacy Act. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140090149,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 5048. the Good Samaritan Assessment Act. This legislation is part of a series of bills the House is considering this week in an effort to address the growing public health crisis in our Nation that is being caused by a surge in heroin use and abuse of other opioid drugs. Without question. abuse of opioid drugs can have serious longterm effects. including physical and functional changes to the brain affecting impulse. reward. and motivation. But opioid abuse can have a more immediate and serious consequence. An overdose can threaten the life of the victim. In recent years. heroin and prescription opioid drug overdoses have risen sharply in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. drug overdose deaths more than doubled between 1999 and 2014. In 2014 alone. more than 47.000 people died from drug overdoses. the highest of any previous year. Fortunately. many of these tragic deaths can be prevented through the administration of an opioid reversal drug such as naloxone. But to be effective in saving lives. these drugs must be administered on an emergency basis. First responders answering emergency calls or caregivers who are treating drug users are frequently in the best position to administer a lifesaving reversal drug in time to be effective. An overdose victims family and friends as well as other drug users are often the first people to be aware that an individual is suffering a drug overdose. Nevertheless. these individuals can hesitate or even fail to call 911 out of fear that they may be prosecuted or otherwise held liable if something goes wrong. [ 1700 Similarly. first responders and other potential caregivers may hesitate or fail to administer emergency medical treatment for fear of possible adverse consequences. To alleviate such concerns and help ensure that overdose victims receive timely medical treatment. the Office of National Drug Control Policy has been working with States and municipalities to enact socalled Good Samaritan laws. These laws are intended to protect from civil or criminal liability first responders. caregivers. and others who call for emergency assistance in overdose cases or administer opioid reversal drugs. Currently. 35 States and the District of Columbia now have at least some form of a Good Samaritan or a 911 drug immunity law. but the protections afforded by these laws vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. H.R. 5048 directs the Government Accountability Office to study and report to the appropriate committees of Congress on the efforts of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to expand Good Samaritan protections. In addition. the study would examine any law that exempts from civil or criminal liability individuals who contact emergency service providers in response to a drug overdose or who administer opioid reversal drugs to overdose victims. The report must also include a compilation of Good Samaritan laws currently in effect. The analysis and data required to be generated by H.R. 5048 will greatly assist Congress in understanding the various policies adopted by the States. Accordingly. I sincerely urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5048. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140090197,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Members of the House. I rise in support of H.R. 2137. the Federal Law Enforcement SelfDefense and Protection Act. This bill would authorize Federal law enforcement officers to carry their governmentissued firearms during government shutdowns and administrative furloughs that result from lapses in appropriations. Essentially. this measure would help ensure that those who protect us are able to continue to do so even during an official furlough. The ability of our Federal law enforcement officers to respond to critical incidents should not be impeded. particularly when violent crimes are committed in their presence. H.R. 2137 does not expand Federal law enforcement officers authority to carry firearms. The bill merely authorizes these officers to continue to carry their federally issued firearms as if a furlough had not occurred. This legislation recognizes the very real threat of harm that many of our officers face. particularly special agents. on a regular basisa threat that does not simply disappear because of a government shutdown. In 2012. for example. more than 1.800 Federal law enforcement officers were assaulted and. of those. approximately 200 sustained serious injuries. Even when off duty. Federal law enforcement officers remain the target of assault. For example. between 2011 and 2014. 27 law enforcement officers were killed while they were off duty. Although this legislation only concerns Federal officers. I want to take a moment to recognize the State. local. and Federal officers who have sacrificed their lives in serving our communities. This week. law enforcement officers throughout the United States have come to Washington to show their support for our fallen officers during National Police Week. In the spirit of National Police Week. it is vitally important that our Federal officers are able to protect people in our communities. themselves. and their family members from the continuing threats they encounter. Given the fact that H.R. 2137 facilitates this critical goal. I am eager to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140112163,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank my colleague from New York. a senior member of the committee with whom I have worked for many years. for yielding. Mr. Speaker. the September 11. 2001. terrorist attack on the United States was the deadliest foreign attack on American soil in our Nations history. Its impact has been immeasurable. as evidenced by the fact that we are still grappling with the cultural and policy implications stemming from the events of that day. And. 15 years on. most Americans continue to feel its searing emotional impact. particularly as the anniversary date approaches this Sunday. This is especially true for those who lost loved ones or were injured as a result of this horrific attack. They deserve our deepest sympathy and our help. So it is in this vein that we consider S. 2040. the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. which. among other things. amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to create a new exception to the acts general grant of foreign sovereign immunity. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this bill last July. at which the bills supporters presented compelling and sympathetic arguments in favor of ensuring that the 9111 families have access to a welldeserved day in court. At the same time. however. the administration and others raised a number of concerns about the bills potential impact that we should keep in mind. First. the administration. some allied nations. and others. assert that the enactment of S. 2040 may lead to retaliation by other countries against the United States. given the breadth of our interests and the expansive reach of our global activities. Secondly. they assert that the bill will hamper cooperation from other nations because they may become more reluctant to share sensitive intelligence. in light of the greater risk that such information may be revealed in litigation. Moreover. they raise the concern that the bill. effectively. would allow private litigants rather than the government to determine foreign and national security policy questions like which states are sponsors of terrorism. Because of the moral imperative of enacting legislation and the seriousness of the concerns raised. I remain hopeful that we can continue to work with the administration to resolve these issues so that legislation can be signed into law by the President. I also want to acknowledge Representatives PETER KING and. particularly. JERROLD NADLER. and Senators JOHN CORNYN and CHARLES SCHUMER for their tireless leadership and efforts to achieve congressional passage of this measure. There is no doubt as to the passion they bring for advocating for victims of the September 11. 2001. attacksa passion that I. and many others. share.

1140030076,"Mr. Chair. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2578. The Internet is one of the great American success stories in our history. benefitting billions of people around the world. Congress has a longstanding and bipartisan commitment to a global. open Internet. free from governmental control. Our support for the decentralized. multistakeholder approach to Internet governance has enabled its growth as an unparalleled platform for economic opportunity and democratic participation. Last year the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced that the U.S. government would take an important step to transition technical functions of the domain name system to the multistakeholder community. This transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to the private sector has been a U.S. policy goal for two decades. through Republican and Democratic administrations alike. Since NTIAs announcement. the multistakeholder community has stepped up to the plate to craft a transition proposal and enhanced accountability measures needed in the absence of U.S. government stewardship. NTIA has articulated specific criteria for the transition proposal and made clear that any plan must advance our vision of a free and open Internet. Despite this significant progress. H.R. 2578 includes language that blocks NTIA from using funds to relinquish the IANA functions. This limitation of funds is not only unnecessary. it sends the wrong message to the international community. Our diplomats point to the IANA transition announcement as a key factor helping us win allies and support for an Internet free of government control. As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stated. this funding restriction ""could result in harm to U.S. businesses and Internet users as a whole."" While I oppose this provision in H.R. 2578. I agree with my colleagues that the IANA transition must be conducted carefully and transparently. Thats why Im working with my Republican colleagues at the Energy and Commerce Committee on legislation to ensure NTIA implements the IANA transition consistent with the principles we all support. Our legislation will address concerns about transparency and accountability. while reaffirming our commitment to the transition. While I cannot support the funding restriction in H.R. 2578. I stand ready to work with my colleagues on responsible oversight of the IANA transition. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule. the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5minute rule. During consideration of the bill for amendment each amendment shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent and shall not be subject to amendment. No pro forma amendment shall be in order except that the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees may offer up to 10 pro forma amendments each at any point for the purpose of debate. The Chair of the Committee of the Whole may accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD designated for that purpose. Amendments so printed shall be considered read. The Clerk will read."
1140032828,I thank the gentlewoman from Texas. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 235. the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act. Now. whether it is communication. commerce. business. education. research. access to the Internet is today an integral part of the everyday life of millions of Americans and people around the world. And we take great pride in this because this is an American invention. Just this month. the GAO released a new report which found that broadband affordability continues to be the most frequently identified barrier to adoption. Now. this whole issue of taxation for access to the Internet. this is not the collection of taxes across State lines. That is another issue. There are over 10.000 taxing agencies in the United States today. Imagine if we. you. your constituents. everyone in the country who uses the Internet has to pay for access to the Internet every time they go to use it. that they would be taxed on that. So. the temporary. or the moratorium bill that we have. now this one makes it permanent. This is a bipartisan effort. Over 200 cosponsors in the Congress are on it. We want to encourage expanded broadband adoption. If you tax it. you are going to shrink it. And I think in the communities that are of lower economic means. this is going to hurt them even more. We need to do everything we can to ensure that Internet access is universally affordable. This bill is an important component of that effort by permanently eliminating the taxation of Internet access. The current moratorium. as my colleagues have said. expires October 1. and we want to be ahead of that to keep the door open. but no taxation to access. I want to salute the chairman. Chairman GOODLATTE. We are good friends. We have worked on other efforts. As I said. this bill has nearly 200 bipartisan cosponsors and strong support of the communications. Internet. and ecommerce industries. So I would urge all of my colleagues to support this. and understand that. from the ground up. we want to expand the use of broadband in our country for every community. Whether they are poor. whether they are rural. whether they are in a city. whether they are middle class individuals. we dont want to weigh the Internet down with taxation of average people in this country. It would really be unfair. and I think it would smother the Internet as we know it.
1140052541,"Mr. Speaker. with passage of H.R. 3614 today. the House will ""kick the can down the road"" on a longterm FAA reauthorization for another six months. I certainly recognize the dire need to keep our airports and air travel system functioning in the face of an expiration of the FAAs authorization in less than 72 hours. However. Im very disappointed that this bill does not contain any changes to current policy regarding aircraft noise impacts on communities surrounding airports. Over the last several months. constituents throughout my Congressional District have experienced an alarming increase in aircraft noise due to the implementation of new flight paths under the FAAs Next Gen program. The new flight paths have caused certain communities to be hit especially hard by airplane noise. and other rural communities that have never experienced it are now being bombarded by noise. Many of these communities received little or no advance notice or opportunity to comment on the flight path changes before they were implemented. and they were blindsided when the changes went into effect earlier this year. In July. I joined the Congressional Quiet Skies Caucus so that together we could make recommendations for the Transportation Committee to include in an FAA reauthorization bill. These recommendations include: ensuring that FAA completes a robust community engagement process before flight paths are changed. requiring the FAA to use a new method of measuring noise that captures the true levels of noise on the ground. removing the categorical exclusion from full environmental reviews for flight path changes. and mandating independent research on the health impacts of aviation noise. These important reforms would substantially improve the FAAs process of addressing and avoiding noise impacts. Once again. I wish to express my disappointment that the bill before us today simply reauthorizes the FAA for another six months with none of these important changes included. As the debate over a longterm FAA reauthorization continues. I hope these recommendations will be carefully considered and ultimately included in the final legislation. The ability to get a good nights sleep for thousands of my constituents depends on it."
1140056884,"I thank the gentlewoman from California. the chair of the California Democratic delegation. and my dear friend and colleague. Mr. Speaker. it is really. I think. bittersweet this evening because we loved Congressman Don Edwards so much. and it is hard to imagine the world without him. He was the kind of human being that you wanted to have live forever. Instead. his contributions to our Nation. to the State of California. to his community are a record that will be revered for generations and generations and generations to come. There is a lot that has already been said about Don. beautiful things that have been said about Don. how he graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School. how he began his professional career as an FBI agent. and how he joined the Navy as an intelligence officer. So he served our country in many different roles. and. of course. the crown of his public service career was right here in the House of the people. the House of Representatives. He was a smallbusiness man in a business that his father owned and that he became a part of during the 1950s. and then. of course. he was elected as a Democrat. In fact. I still have in my office an invitation that Don had sent out. I think it must have been for some fundraiser that he had had. but the cover of that invitation has Don Edwards standing next to a very young President of the United States. John F. Kennedy. Young children and those who helped elect John F. Kennedy and anyone else who comes through my office very often remark about the picture. It is something that I cherish. that my staff cherishes. and my constituents do. It has been said that he was elected to be the president of the California Young Republicans. That is a very prestigious organization. and I can just see Don. elegant in every way. He dressed magnificently. He had the most beautiful posture. The way he carried himself. he almost kind of glided down the hall. But he had a deep sense of humility about him. We talk about his greatness and his goodness. and he was never one to want to be served. His joy was in serving. And so he had more than a healthy dose of humility about him. Don Edwards had an eloquence about him that ran as deep as his beliefs. In my lifetime. he had two great love affairs. One was Edie. and the other was the Constitution. He loved the flag. He understood that that was a symbol of our country. but he knew that the Constitution. our Constitution. was the soul of our Nation. and that is where he embedded himselfin the Constitution and in the subcommittee that did its work to always reinforce and establish the constitutionality and make the Constitution live for people who it had not touched yet. If there is anything that would be noble. I think that that is. and the record that he built was one where he was the foremost champion of civil rights. having drafted every civil rights bill in the House of Representatives for two decades. What a record. What a magnificent record. He loved his community. I remember when he announced that he was retiring. He thanked his constituents for the patience that they had extended to him because. I think. many times in the debate about what is constitutional and how to extend rights to people. it is not always very popular in the beginning. We love our history once it has been made. but we struggle very hard and dont always recognize the opportunity at hand in that history is being made. In his gentle. elegant way. he thanked his constituents for the patience that they had had with him in that they had stayed with him so that he could do the work that he did on their behalf. He famously said. in the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights Act: ""If you cant vote. you are not a real citizen."" So he understood where the nub of the dignity of citizenship rested: voting. I dont think he could really comprehend why the Voting Rights Act is not being brought up today so that we can all vote on it and improve what is so essential in the life of the citizens of our country. I think. Mr. Speaker. that Congressman Edwards would be very proud of his colleagues in the California Democratic delegation today. starting with our chair. ZOE LOFGREN. who not only worked side by side with him. but now chairs our delegation. The values that he carried. the values that he loved and that he made so real and shared with everyone in the House. whether colleagues agreed or disagreed with him. they drew a great sense of joy from him because they knew the love of our Constitution and of our country that he carried. and so they respected him. What he carried and did here. I think he would be very proud of his fellow Californians for carrying those traditions on. I want to pay tribute especially to Shary Farr. Congressman SAM FARRs wife. As I said to Shary. because she was there when Don took his last breath. I feel that we were all there with him because she was. She did so much in seeing to the great care that was given to him until he took his last breath. There is a poet that wrote: And so he passed on. and all the trumpets sounded on the other side. God bless you. Don Edwards. for what you gave and created for our country. We bless your name. and we thank you for your service. It is an honor to honor you. We love the Edwards family. and we always will."
1140062658,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2583. the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2015. a bipartisan bill aimed at giving the FCC flexibility while promoting openness. transparency and accountability. In the 113th Congress. the House of Representatives considered and passed similar legislation by voice vote. The bill before us adds to the previously included reforms by including three legislative proposals offered during the Energy & Commerce Committees debate. First. a proposal offered by Rep. CLARKE would require the FCC to report quarterly to Congress and to post. on its website. data on the total number of decisions pending. categorized by bureau. the type of request. the length of time pending. as well as a list of pending Congressional investigations and their costs to the agency. Second. a proposal by Rep. LOEBSACK would require the Chairman to post the Commissions internal procedures on the FCC website and update the website when the Chairman makes any changes. Third. the underlying bill includes a proposal offered by Rep. MATSUI which would require the FCC to coordinate with the Small Business Administration and issue recommendations to improve small business participation in FCC proceedings. Collectively the proposals by Reps. CLARKE. LOEBSACK and MATSUI would modernize and enhance transparency at the FCC without jeopardizing regulatory certainty or opening the Commission to legal challenges on every agency action. Im also pleased that the bill incorporates the FCC Collaboration Act of 2015. a bipartisan bill I introduced earlier this year with Reps. SHIMKUS and DOYLE. For years. current and former FCC Commissioners have called on Congress to pass sunshine reform. so that three or more Commissioners can hold nonpublic collaborative discussions. as long as no agency action is taken. While I remain disappointed that this provision will not take effect immediately upon enactment. Ive concluded that any further delay in implementation is the unnecessary delay of a much needed reform. I thank Chairman WALDEN for working with me and my staff to put forward a bipartisan bill and I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
1140065290,"Mr. Speaker. let me begin by saying Im pleased that this bill includes several measures I have championed. including bills Ive offered relating to energy efficiency and electric vehicles. However. I have to oppose this legislation because H.R. 8 fails to address climate change. In fact. the bill includes several controversial provisions that shift our nations energy policy into reverse. Im very grateful to Chairman UPTON and Subcommittee Chairman WHITFIELD for including my legislation. the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act. in the base text of H.R. 8. This bipartisan. noncontroversial bill which I introduced with Rep. KINZINGER. received 375 votes on the House floor last year. This measure would save taxpayers millions of dollars and would make the federal government a leader in reducing energy use at data centers which can be highly inefficient. I also appreciate that two amendments I offered at the Energy and Commerce Committee markup of this bill were agreed to by voice vote and are included in the Managers Amendment. The first would allow federal agencies to offer electric vehicle charging stations to guests and employees. a practice that is not currently allowed. The second would add transparency requirements to ensure that only critical infrastructure information is protected from FOIA requests. and that this designation is periodically reviewed to ensure this authority is not abused. These provisions are incremental but important steps toward promoting innovation and deployment of clean and energysaving technologies. Unfortunately. the same cannot be said about the rest of H.R. 8. With historic international climate negotiations currently underway in Paris. this socalled ""comprehensive"" energy bill does not include a single reference to climate change or promotion of renewable resources. This represents the squandering of an opportunity to put in place a 21st century energy policy for our country that promotes clean energy and reduces our dependence on the fossil fuel resources that cause climate change. H.R. 8 includes several controversial provisions that my colleagues and I opposed at Committee and that are also opposed by the Administration. For example. the bill contains unnecessary provisions to shortcircuit the review process for exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The current process. which requires the Department of Energy to ensure that all exports are in the public interest of the United States. is working and already has us on track to be the largest LNG exporter in the world within a decade. H.R. 8 also includes provisions that would require a shortsighted view of energy efficiency investments in building codes. and it would repeal the requirement that all new and remodeled federal buildings phase out fossil fuel use by 2030. Lastly. the Managers Amendment includes a highly controversial bill from the Natural Resources Committee that would limit public review and direct more natural gas pipelines to be built on public lands. including National Parks. Again. I appreciate the Chairmans willingness to accept my bipartisan additions to this bill. but I cannot support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to oppose it."
1140085851,Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2666. and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. today we are debating a bill that the majority has titled the No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act. It sounds terrific. On the surface. this bill appears to do what Democrats and Republicans both support. We both support this. What we support is very clear: preventing the FCC from setting the monthly rate that customers pay for Internet access service. But in reality. this bill is about undermining the FCCs authority to protect consumers and ensure a free and open Internet for all. I listened very carefully to the chairman. whom I respect. who is my friend. talking about innovation. talking about the effect that that has on so much that we do. I represent the innovation capital of our country and the world. Silicon Valley. so I think that I understand something about innovation and the ingredients that make it work. As the ranking member of the subcommittee. I have made it very clear that I do not support setting rates for customers to pay on Internet access. nor do any of my Democratic colleagues on the committee. In factand the chairman left this out. The chairman left this out. In fact. during the subcommittee and full committee markup of this bill. I offered an airtight. onepage amendment. right hereright here. onepage amendmentto codify that the FCC will permanently forbear from setting the rates that customers pay for Internet access. It is airtight. It is as clear as a bell. but it was rejected twice. Now. why would the majority reject exactly what they say they are seeking? It is a good question. It is a rhetorical question. but it should be raised. I think it is because this bill is about more than the FCC setting the rates that customers pay for Internet access. The FCC is the cop on the beat in the communications marketplace. That means the FCC has the responsibility to keep watch over the companies that provide our cell phone. cable. and Internet services to ensure that everyone is treated fairly. I think. in the absence of the following. not one consumer organization in the country supports the bill that is on the floor because it is overly broad. The definition of rate regulation in this bill leaves the door open for courts to strike down the FCCs authority to protect consumers and act in the public interest if they interpret any of its actions as impacting broadband Internet rates. That is what this bill does. That is what we object to. We do not object to. essentially. what the title of the bill is. No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access. These protections include prohibiting Internet service providers. ISPs. from capping the amount of data that customers can use. outlawing payforprivacy agreements where consumers have to pay fees to avoid having their data collected and sold to third parties. enforcing net neutrality rules against blocking Web sites. and reviewing mergers that increase consolidation and limit choice in the broadband Internet market. As I said a moment ago. it is no wonder this bill is opposed by over 70 public interest groups. including the National Hispanic Media Coalition. the Consumer Federation of America. and the National Consumer Law Center. And the White House has said that it will veto the bill. We could have come here with a very simple bill that essentially is what my amendment stated: no rate regulation. That is what the majority says that they are for. except the bill goes way beyond that. I want to make it clear to my colleagues and to the American people that may be tuned in to this debate: This bill. in its broadness. is an attack on consumers and an attack on the FCCs net neutrality rules. Now. that is not a surprise because the majority has never supported that. And that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. Mr. Chairman. I include in the RECORD three letters from consumer organizations. I reserve the balance of my time. Hon. PAUL RYAN. Speaker. House of Representatives. Hon. NANCY PELOSI. Democratic Leader. House of Representatives.
1140085894,"Mr. Chairman. I have no further requests for time. and I am prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. this has been an interesting discussion on the floor this morning. For people who are tuned in. I think that I want to stay away from Federal talk. telecommunications talk. governmentese. What this debate is all about is the Internet. There is a clear difference between how the Democrats view the Internet and how to protect its openness and its accessibility. and that rests in net neutralitynot a very sexy term. What it means is that no ISP can get in the way of the consumer. All you have to do is look in your purse or in your pocket. What you take out and the content that you view and whatever the Internet carries. no company can get in the way of thatto chop it up. to slow it down. to speed it up. to charge more. Now. our Republican colleagues have fought mightily. and I salute them with their mightily launched campaign in that they dont believe in that. and that is really what is underneath this. They talk about Federal bureaucracies. They dont like that. They talk about bureaucrats. They dont like them. They talk about the President. They dont like him. What is at the heart of all of this is that we believe in that open. accessible Internet. We do not believe that the executive branchin this case. the FCCshould be able to regulate broadband rates. We have said so. We have said so time and again. The gentleman from North Dakota objected to my amendment. He said that it was an oxymoron. Our amendment codified. No one else codified. We offered codification in the law that not only this FCC Commission but all future Commissionsall future Chairmencould not exact rate regulation. I dont know what needs to be done in order to get to ""yes"" around here. and it is curious to me that all of the speakers on the other side never referenced what we put on the tablethat there is agreement. Really. this bill goes beyond that. and that is what we object to. There is not one consumer organization in our country that supports what the majority is doing. We stand with consumers. They need a cop on the beatwe dont need the rate regulation of broadband by the FCCjust the way other agencies are supposed to look after the best interests of the American people. In fact. in the Communications Act. the public interest is stated over 100 times. We believe in that. The majority has gone too far with this bill. It can hurt small businesses. and it will hurt consumers. That is where we draw the line. Mr. Chairman. for all of these reasons. I urge my colleagues to vote ""no"" on H.R. 2666. It goes too far. We were willing to meet and join hands and have something sail through the Houseand I think it would have in the other body as welland that is that there be no rate regulation of broadband Internet. I dont know. Maybe the majority was shocked that we agreed with their talking point. We are serious about it. We offered a solution to it that was rejected not once but twice. Very disappointing. For all of these reasons and with what my colleagues stated on this side in the magnificent statements that they made. I urge the House to reject this legislation because it goes well beyond its stated intent. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140100946,"Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay. well. well let Brock fill it in. I was pummeled with narrow. pointed questions that dissected my personal life. love life. past life. family life. inane questions. accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who had me half naked before even bothering to ask for my name. After a physical assault. I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me. to say see. her facts dont line up. shes out of her mind. shes practically an alcoholic. she probably wanted to hook up. hes like an athlete right. they were both drunk. whatever. the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact. why take it into account. Brock has a lot at stake so hes having a really hard time right now. And then it came time for him to testify and I learned what it meant to be revictimized. ""I want to remind you. the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didnt know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasnt feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember. So one year later. as predicted. a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story. almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground. and most importantly in this new story. there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident. he remembered. oh yeah. by the way she actually said yes. to everything. so. ""He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. Hed asked if I wanted to go to his dorm. I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys dont ask. can I finger you? Usually theres a natural progression of things. unfolding consensually. not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. Hes in the clear. Even in his story. I only said a total of three words. yes yes yes. before he had me half naked on the ground."""

1130026789,Mr. Chairman. with regard to the first amendment. this amendment is identical to language that was inserted into the Military ConstructionVA bill yesterday by a voice vote. It expands the list of parties with whom the Department of Homeland Security and other relevant entities are prohibited from contracting. This includes contractors who have been convicted of fraud. theft. forgery. bribery. et cetera. according to the terms of the amendment and otherwise. With regard to Grayson No. 3. the next amendment. this amendment is a simple one. It reads: None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of the First. Second or Fourth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. As you will notice. the same sentiment and relevant language appears in my colleague Mr. ELLISONS amendment addressing racial discrimination and other matters. I gladly support his efforts. which passed unanimously by voice vote last Congress. and hope the same will be possible of my amendment in this Congress. With regard to the last Grayson amendment. I regret that my colleague Representative HOLT could not be here to offer this amendment himself. He is in New Jersey today. remembering Senator Lautenberg. The amendment that I call up is actually the HoltGrayson amendment. the last amendment. Its an amendment that Mr. HOLT attached to the bill in the last Congress as an en bloc amendment offered by Representative ADERHOLT. which passed unanimously. The text of the amendment is the same word for word. and it reads as follows: None of the funds made available by this Act may be used for the purchase. operation or maintenance of armed unmanned aerial vehicles. This is an important amendment and one that I am proud to offer here today on behalf of Representative HOLT. In no instance should DHS have access to or use weaponized drones. The bill before us today is the appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. not the Department of Defense. That appropriations bill will come to the floor later this month. we hope. As our wars abroad come to a close and as excess militarized drones become available for purchase and use potentially by DHS. I feel that its important to lay down this marker here today that says. no. DHS may not have access to that military equipment. DHS will continue to have access to surveillance drones. and if the committee report is correct. DHS will increase its supply of drones and possibly even build a new airfield to support them. In his previous amendment. Congressman HOLT shared his thoughts on the ways in which these drones should not be used. so I will close with this: Chairman CARTER and Ranking Member PRICE. lets be clear with DHSno armed drones in the United States. I ask for the support of this amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time.
1130053146,"Mr. Speaker. pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX. I rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges of the House. The form of the resolution is as follows: Whereas. the BBC News. on October 1. 2013 in England. published the following: ""For most of the world. a government shutdown is very bad newsthe result of revolution. invasion or disaster. Even in the middle of its ongoing civil war. the Syrian government has continued to pay its bills and workers wages. That leaders of one of the most powerful nations on earth willingly provoked a crisis that suspends public services and decreases economic growth is astonishing to many."". Whereas. the staterun Xinhua news service. on October 2. 2013 in China. published the following: ""With no political unity to redress its policy mistake. a dysfunctional Washington is now overspending the confidence in its leadership."". Whereas. The News of Mexico. on September 25. 2013 in Mexico. published the following: ""They squabble over the inconsequential accomplishment of a 10week funding extension. It isnt serious. but it certainly isnt funny."". Whereas. the Australian. on October 1. 2013 in Australia. published the following: ""The irresponsible way in which Congress ... played the politics of partisan petulance and obstruction . . . does them little credit. Neither does it say much for the budgetary processes in the worlds largest economy."". Whereas. the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. on October 2. 2013 in Germany. published the following: ""The main actors in this dispute. which brings together many factors. both ideological and political. took a huge risk and. unhindered. proceeded to validate everyone who ever accused the political establishment in Washington of being rotten to the core . . . The public is left wondering how things could have been allowed to get to this point and why there is so much poison in the system."". Whereas. the Siiddeutsche Zeitung. on October 2. 2013 in Germany. published the following: ""What has already been apparent in America for a few years now is the selfdestruction of one of the worlds oldest democracies. And the great tragedy here is that this work of destruction isnt being wrought by enemies of democracy. greedy lobbyists or sinister major party donors. Americas democracy is being broken by the very people who are supposed to carry and preserve it ... the politicians . . . At the moment. Washington is fighting over the budget and nobody knows if the country will still be solvent in three weeks . . . What is clear. though. is that America is already politically bankrupt"". Whereas. the Washington Post. on September 30. 2013. quoted Justice Malala. a political commentator in South Africa as saying the following: ""They tell us. You guys are not being fiscally responsible . . . And now we see that they are running their country a little like a banana republic . . . there is a lot of sniggering going on."". Whereas. the headline of the New York Daily News. the fourth most widely circulated daily newspaper in the United States. on October 1. 2013. read: ""House of Turds"". and the bylines stated: ""D.C. cesspols shut down government"" and ""They get paid while nation suffers"". Whereas. these reports call into question the dignity of the House. and Whereas. the resulting reduction in the publics perception of the Houses dignity has culminated in a 7% Congressional approval rating in the most recent Economist/ YouGov poll: Now. therefore. be it Resolved. That it is the sense of the House (1) without seeking to effect a change in the rules or standing orders of the House or their interpretation. and (2) without prescribing a special order of business for the House that a government shutdown is a mark upon the dignity of the House and that the House would be willing to pass a ""clean"" continuing appropriations resolution to end it."
1130088180,"Mr. Chair. I rise today to thank Chairman CULBERSON and Ranking Member BISHOP for including legislative language I requested in this years Military Construction. Veteran Affairs. and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. 2015. It appears in section 232. as follows: SEC. 232. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to award a contract to any contractor if the past performance of the contractor resulted in the completion of a construction project at a facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs more than 24 months after the original agreedupon completion date for the project. This language also exists as a standalone bill I have introduced. H.R. 4394: the Serve Our Heroes Now Act. What it means is thisif someone is responsible for a delay of two years. or more. of completion of a VA facility. they cannot awarded future contracts for military or VA construction. In my own district. the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (""VA"") is building a new VA Medical Center (""VAMC"") that will serve an area of more than 90.000 veteran patients in East Central Florida. This VAMC will be one of seven members of the VISN 8 Healthcare System. covering parts of Florida. Georgia. and all of Puerto Rico. The original construction contract for the Orlando VAMC called for a final completion date of October 2. 2012. Eighteen months later. my constituents. who bravely fought for their country. are still waiting. This is a disgrace. and it must be remedied. Section 232 is clear. If the current contractor for the Orlando VAMC is determined to be at fault for construction delays. it will be ineligible for future contracts awarded from funds appropriated by this bill. That hurtsbut it doesnt compare to the pain my constituents suffer while waiting for the VA Medical Center that has been promised to them. In closing. Mr. Chair. I want every Member here. and anyone else watching. to know that I will request this language in every Military Construction. Veteran Affairs. and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that comes to this floor. as long as I serve in this body. Those responsible will be held accountable. I pray other veterans do not have to wait as long as my constituents have. and I pray that the new Orlando VAMC is fully operational by October of this year."
1130095752,"Mr. Chairman. this amendment is simple. It prohibits the Federal Bureau of Prisons from soliciting. offering. or awarding a contractand by the way. I am talking about a new contract. not an existing contractto a forprofit prison that guarantees the number of prisoners that will be housed there. I believe it is not only bad policy but fundamentally immoral to guarantee that our government will incarcerate a specific number of people so that a forprofit entity can guarantee its profit margin. Whether or not we agree on the main impetus for incarcerationpunishment. rehabilitation. or some combination of bothI would hope that we can all agree that a perverse conflict of interest. such as the one that this amendment addresses. should not be allowed to exist to be able to guarantee a profit on human bodies. This amendment seeks to eliminate any potential for a repeat of the ""kids for cash"" scandal that unfolded in 2008. In that instance. two judges from Pennsylvania accepted money from the builder of two private forprofit juvenile facilities in return for imposing harsh sentences on juveniles brought before their courts. All told. those two individuals received $2.6 million in payments from the managers at that company. American citizens freedom and the length of a convicted persons prison sentence should never be a line item on a business sheet. I would hate to imagine a world in which certain segments of our society could honestly question whether or not they are being targeted purely for filling an incarceration quota guaranteed to a forprofit prison. Let me be clear. I may not like forprofit prisons. but this amendment would not ban them nor would it have any effect on existing contracts that the Federal Government has already entered into. What it does do is it bans a practice of guaranteeing under new contracts a specific number of human beings that will be jailed or imprisoned in a given year. I think that is wrong. I hope that you do too. I urge a ""yes"" vote on this amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time."
1130095876,Mr. Chair. I regret bringing this up at 10:30 at night. I apologize for that because this is a weighty matter. and I think it deserves fair consideration. I hope we are not all too tired to deny this question the attention that it deserves. The purpose of this amendment is to raise the possibility of a Federal shield law that corresponds to shield law already in place in 49 States. but not at the level of the Federal Government. A shield law is legislation designed to protect a reporters privilege or the right of news reporters to refuse to testify as to information and sources of information obtained during a news gather and dissemination process. In short. a reporter should not be forced to reveal his or her source. and that is in fact the law in 49 States. the only exception being Wyoming. This has come up in court cases at the Federal level and at the Supreme Court level. beginning with the 1972 case Branzburg v. Hayes. which I think poses this question in the microcosm. In that case. a reporter wanted to inform his readers about the nature of the drug hashish. and he realized the only way to go about that was to find and interview people who had actually used the drug hashish. and so he did that. After he published his article. relying upon these two confidential sources. at that point. he was subpoenaed to provide those sources. compromising their identity and compromising the principle of protecting your sources. This is an issue that comes up from time to time. often at the State level. occasionally at the Federal level. Some of us may remember the case of the Plame affair. the CIA leak scandal. A reporter was asked to release the name of the person to whom he had been perceived to leak regarding Valerie Plame. Reporters were asked. in general: Who are your sources with regards to this leak? One reporter. Judith Miller of The New York Times. was jailed for 85 days in 2005 for refusing to disclose her source in the government probe. At this point. under current law. journalists are in a quandary. They realize the need to protect their sources. That right is recognized in 49 States. but it is not codified at the Federal level. so what I seek to do at this late hour today is to do just that. I think this is a very important principle. as Branzburg pointed out. that springs from the foundation of our law. The Constitution and the First Amendment provide for freedom of speech and of the press. It is completely incongruous to say we have freedom of the press. but the Federal Government can subpoena your sources and put them and you in prisonyou. if you dont comply. This is something that should have been handled perhaps years. if not decades ago. It falls upon us tonight. at this late hour. to try to handle it ourselves. I respectfully submit this amendment as being a muchneeded and longdelayed clarification that the Federal Government treats this matter no differently than 49 States now do. and therefore. I ask for support on this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130098640,Mr. Chairman. the purpose of this amendment is to reverse $5.5 million in cuts for food safety and food inspection here in the United States. Currently. the Food Safety and Inspection Service is funded at $1.005.189.000 in this bill. That is $5.5 million below the current enacted amount and $17.581 million below the Senate allocation in their agriculture appropriations bill. This bill seeks to remove $5.5 million from a payfor from the Farm Service Agency. The Farm Service Agency is funded at $1.205.068.000 in this bill. That is over $27 million above the current enacted amount. and it is $65.5 million above the Presidents request and $22.5 million above the Senate allocation. Certainly. farm conservation and regulation is very important. and that is the function of the Farm Service Agency. However. food safety and food inspection is paramount because of all the problems that the country is facing today on this count. According to this study by Robert Scharff that I have in my hand here from the Journal of Food Protection. dated 2012. the economic burden of health loss is due to foodborne illnesses in the United States. The cost of foodborne illnesses in the United States each year is $77.7 billion. That is $77.7 billion. Food safety and food losses and foodborne illnesses lead to 128.000 hospitalizations every year and. unfortunately. 3.000 deaths every year in the United States. Specifically. we have a total of 3.036 deaths caused by bacteria. by parasites. and by viruses. The shame of it. Mr. Chairman. the ultimate shame. is that food poisoning is 100 percent preventable. Every single instance of death. hospitalization could be avoided if we had a properly funded and fully funded food inspection system. That is the dilemma that faces us today. Each year. under this bill. the inspectors are required to inspect every animal before slaughter and each carcass after slaughter. in order to ensure that public health requirements are met. In one recent year. this included 50 billion pounds of livestock carcasses. 59 billion pounds of poultry carcasses. and 4.3 billion pounds of processed egg products. At U.S. borders. they also inspected 3.3 billion pounds of imported meat and poultry products. Increasingly. food safety is a global concern. Globalization of food production and trade increases the likelihood of international incidents involving contaminated food. Imported food products and ingredients are common in many countries. including our own. Stronger food safety systems in export countries can reinforce local and cross border health security. but. frankly. the ultimate responsibility is ours. Seventyfive percent of new infectious diseases affecting humans over the past 10 years were caused by bacteria. viruses. and pathogens that started in animals and in animal products. Many of these diseases are in people who are related to the handling of infected domestic and wild animals during food production. in food markets. and at slaughterhouses. Preventing disease starts at the farm. which is where the inspections take place. Preventing animal infections at the farm level can reduce foodborne illnesses. For example. reducing the amount of salmonella in farm chickens by 50 percent through better farm management and inspections results in 50 percent fewer incidences of people getting sick from the bacteria. Salmonellafree chicken herds are what this country needs. It is fundamentally irresponsible for this body to be cutting the Food Safety and Inspection Service budget. God help us all if there is some widespread outbreak in this country where we dont have 3.000 deaths a year. we dont have 30.000 deaths a year. but we have 300.000 deaths a year caused by poor food inspection standards. We must restore this money to the budget. and I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130100596,"Mr. Chairman. I rise today to address a growing problem throughout our country. the militarization of local law enforcement agencies. Police in our communities should be engaged in community policing. Unfortunately. all too often. local police departments have begun to look like military units preparing for battle on Americas streets. We fight our wars abroad. not at home. and the weapons and tactics used on our local streets should reflect that fact. The New York Times recently reported that: Police departments have received thousands of pieces of camouflage and nightvision equipment and hundreds of silencers. armored cars. and aircraft. I think this is appalling. My amendment would prohibit the Department of Defense from gifting excess equipment. such as aircraftincluding dronesarmored vehicles. grenade launchers. silencers. bombs. and so on to local police departments. There is no mass rebellion brewing here in the United States. There are no improvised explosive devices on the sides of our roads. but the abuse of military equipment to ward off these nonexistent threats is happening nonetheless. So. of course. what you would expect to happen is happening. As The New York Times article. ""War Gear Flows to Police Departments"" explains: Police SWAT teams are now deployed tens of thousands of times each year. increasingly for routine jobs. Masked. heavilyarmed police officers raided a nightclub in 2006 as part of a liquor inspection. In Florida in 2010. officers in SWAT gear and with guns drawn carried out raids on barbershops that mostly led to charges of ""barbering without a license."" DOD equipment is changing the mentality of police departments throughout our country. Recruiting videos now feature clips of officers storming into homes with smoke grenades and firing automatic weapons into homes. as well as clips of officers creeping through the fields in camouflagewar camouflage. This is not policing. this is war. One South Carolina sheriffs department now takes its new tanklike vehicle with a mounted .50caliber gun to schools and community events. The department spokesman said his tank is a conversation starter. That is not a conversation I want us to have. I think this is wrong. The Federal Government should not be encouraging our public servants to view America as occupied territory. I prefer the views of Ronald Teachman. the police chief in South Bend. Indiana. According to that New York Times article. he decided not to request a mineresistant vehicle for his city of South Bend. Indiana. He said: I go to schools. and I bring ""Green Eggs and Ham."" Lets encourage leaders like the very appropriately named Ronald Teachman. Lets not treat our citizens as terrorists. and lets help our police act like the public servants they need to be. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130101171,Mr. Chairman. the amendment at the desk is simple. It reads as you just read it. As you know. Guantanamo was opened for business. so to speak. in January of 2002. It is now June of 2014. My amendment seems to give some kind of clue as to how long we. a free people who respect freedom. are willing to incarcerate and imprison people who have been accused of no crime. have faced no judge. no jury. and have never been subject to the American system of justice. My amendment has no immediate effect during this fiscal year. As it says. it is limited to persons who have served for 15 years or more at Guantanamo Bay. The facility itself is only 12 years old. What this amendment does do is ensure that no funds will be made available by this bill that are carried over to future fiscal years and are then used to imprison anyone for 15 years or longer if they havent been accused. much less convicted of any crime. I would hope that we. as a free people. would understand that principle and agree that this is reasonable. Nobody. nobody. foreign or American. should be subject to imprisonment for more than 15 years without ever even facing his accusers. much less being convicted of a crime. That is particularly true under the auspices of the U.S. Government because we are a people of laws. not a people of people. This amendment is silent as to whether detainees could be convicted under an article III court. a military tribunal. a commission. or some other form of court with the authority to render any judgment. It simply says that a person must be convicted of a crime or must be released from Guantanamo if they have served 15 years. 15 years. Mr. Chairman. of detention. We have speedy trial rules in this country that guarantee the right to face your accusers within 6 months. These prisoners. both the innocent ones and the guilty ones. have been incarcerated without hearing any charges against them now for more than a decade. I would urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment and recognize the dignity of all human beings. whether or not they have the privilege to be American citizens. In the year 1209. in a French city called Beziers. a monk oversaw the Albigensian crusade. The crusaders were brought into that city to deal with the heretics. the Albigensians. who lived in that French town. Arnaud Amelric. a monk. was asked: What should we do with these people. these Christians who are like us who dont believe exactly what we believe? He said: Kill them all and let God sort it out. That has stood for many years as a signal that we must expect more from civilized people than that. We are holding these people in that prison. all of them. the innocent and the guilty apparently. under current rules. forever and ever and ever. What is worse. killing them all and letting God sort it out. or holding them forever and not letting them ever meet their God but remain in prison for their entire lives? I submit to you that we Americans are better than this. There has to be some kind of limitation. This amendment will not force the release of anyone imminently. but will be a signal to all mankind that we. the American people. we retain our dignity and our humanity. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130106357,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank my colleague from Florida and the gentleman from New York for consideration of this amendment. Mr. Chairman. budgets are about choices. We have a choice to make here that is an interesting one. and I wanted to point it out in the form of presenting this amendment. The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence is one of the most important functions of the Treasury Department. Economic and trade sanctions are issued and enforced by the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. and they protect the financial system from criminal and illicit activities and counteract national security threats from drug lords. terrorists. weapons of mass destruction. proliferators. and rogue nations. among others. In addition to that. this office provides vital analysis with regard to foreign intelligence and counterintelligence across all elements of the national security community. I think it is fair to say that this office has done excellent work in connection with the Iran Sanctions Act. which is an act within the jurisdiction of my committee. the Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee involved here directs the Department of the Treasury to post online and disseminate publicly those companies that are not compliant with the Iran Sanctions Act as well as any foreign entities doing business with the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps. In addition to that. this office has done excellent work with regard to cutting back on the threat of genocide in Sudan. South Sudan. the Central African Republic. and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite the essential functioning of this office for the purpose of our carrying out American foreign policy. this office has a budget of only $120 million for the entire year. I contrast that with the budget being proposed of $158 million for the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. In short. we are spending. or proposing to spend. $38 million more for the Treasury inspector general to inspect the IRS than we are proposing to spend for the Treasury to carry out its essential functions of economic trade and trade sanctions. These functions basically make our troops safe and keep America safe. Without the economic sanctions that we imposed against Iran. we might see American troops fighting today in the Middle East. It is essential and important that these functions be carried out without being curtailed for a lack of money. I dont suggest that we equalize these two accounts. although I think a good argument could be made to do that. Rather. I suggest that we reduce the disparity between these two accounts by adding $5 million to allow the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence to carry out its essential functions for U.S. foreign policy and reduce the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration budget by a corresponding $5 million. Again. budgets are about choices. I think that our national security is our number one priority. and I think that whatever may be that is being done by the Treasury inspector general to investigate the IRS. it can wait as long as that money is needed to keep America safe. With that. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.

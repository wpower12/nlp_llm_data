1140031421,"Mr. Chairman. my amendment eliminates the funding that might be used in contravention of section 642(a) that is designated in the amendment. 642(a) is the section in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. as I know it. that prohibits the political subdivisions in America from establishing sanctuary policies we often refer to as sanctuary cities. These are the political subdivisions that establish a policy that prohibit their law enforcement officers and their other agents from cooperating with Federal immigration officials. It seems illogical to me to think that any local government would want to prohibit their law enforcement officers from assisting in. cooperating with. and transferring information to the Federal law enforcement officers who are enforcing immigration law. That section. it reads. in part. but with the thought being contained here: ""Notwithstanding."" the language says. ""the political subdivisions may not prohibit. or in any way restrict any government entity or official from sending to or receiving from the INS""-at the time. that is ICE today""information regarding the citizenship or immigration status. lawful or unlawful. of any individual."" Mr. Chairman. I grew up in a law enforcement family. I looked at the men around me as a little boy. and I just thought that all adult men put on a uniform of some kind or another. I was steeped in respect for the supreme law of the landthe Constitutionand the rule of law. When there was an issue that came forward. whether it was a bank robbery or some tragedy that took place. all levels of law enforcement cooperated with all other levels of law enforcement. No one that was a member of the city police said: I am not going to be serving papers here because that is the countys job. No county deputy decided that he wouldnt pull somebody over for speeding because that was the city speed limit on a city street. No highway patrol officer decided that he wouldnt enforce local law. No one that came in from the Division of Criminal Investigation or the FBI decided that it was their bailiwick. that it was exclusively their law to enforce and that no one should help them with that. Law enforcement. to be effective. has to be a cooperation from all levels. and. of course. the public has to respect the rule of law. and they have to respect those who are there to protect and serve and to also enforce that law. For me. I cannot understand how or why a city would establish these policies. but they are doing so. In the process of that. they are undermining the rule of law and eroding the respect for the rule of law and leaving their citizens vulnerable. when we could be helping them with Federal officers who need to get this information. This is an amendment that has been offered in multiple years. It has passed this House multiple times. The number that I saw last year with the identical language passed the House by a vote of 21494. We have been consistent in defending the rule of law. This amendment says that no funds shall go to these political subdivisions from this bill. if they establish sanctuary city policies. to put it in short summation. I urge its adoption. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1140033501,I thank the chairman for yielding and for leading on this issue. Mr. Speaker. I just would remark that wine has informed the meat debate several times here today. and I am glad of that. I rise in support of this legislation to repeal these components of country of origin labeling. I have long held the position that this is a North American market. We dont treat our best trading partners as well as we should. Mr. Speaker. and that includes Mexico. and it especially includes Canada. I often have to go through the list of things we have done that turn out to be something that looks like trade protection at least to them. We have done it with steel. We have done it with softwood timber. We have done it when we have BSE circumstances with beef. which did originate in Canada. spilled over to the United States. and they opened up their foreign trade before we did. This is one of these examples of what happens when you go a little overboard in an effort to try to establish some trade protectionism. This was driven by the people. especially in the Northwest. that thought that they would get an advantage on their cattle industry in that part of the country. Now. we are looking at these sanctions which. by my numbers. likely go to somewhere in the area of $3.15 billion in sanctions between Canada and Mexico. Mr. Speaker. 85 percent of our consumers dont even look at the label to see where that comes from. Consumers still have a choice. There is nothing that would prohibit in the aftermath of this legislation. The consumer is saying: I would like to know if this pig was born in Canada and fed in the United States. To give you an example of how this is. there is a lot of U.S. capital that is invested also. especially in farrowing operations in Canada. When the exchange rate was even more advantageous than it is today. a lot of U.S. dollars went into Canada to establish farrowing operations to raise pigs up there because they could isolate in order to do disease prevention and because it was a good investment. then those isowean pigs came down to the United States. The numbers that I had was 6 million pigs coming down. 4 million of them came to Iowa. A third of the pork raised in the United States is from my State. and they are at a disadvantage because of this country of origin labeling. It penalizes. Mr. Speaker. the very people we are trying to help. I urge the adoption of this bill.
1140040636,"Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to address you here on the floor of the House of Representatives and being recognized. I have been listening to this debate over the last week or so. and it has troubled me considerably to watch divisions being driven between the American people over symbolism that has now been redefined by a lot of Members of the opposite party. I regret. like all of us do in this country. the tragic and brutal and evil murders of the nine people in Charleston. South Carolina. I pray for them and their families. They stood up and showed us an example of faith that I think surpasses any that I have seen in my lifetime by forgiving the killer. I am not to that point in my faith. Mr. Speaker. the least that I can tell. but that was very moving. They didnt want to see a division created. they wanted to heal. and they wanted to see Christs love come out of Charleston. Charleston is a wonderful and beautiful city. and I dont know where I would go to find nicer people if I couldnt go actually home. Mr. Speaker. so I couldnt say enough good about that. I have listened to this rhetoric that has poured forth over these days. It appears to me that it is now being turned into something that is division. rather than unifying. We unified in our grief with the people of South Carolina. the people of Charleston. Now. we are seeing the Confederate battle flag be put up as a symbol to be redefined as something different than is understood by the majority of the American people. I grew up in the North. Mr. Speaker. and the Confederate flag always was a symbol of the pride of the South from where I grew up. My family and my predecessors and my ancestors were abolitionists. and they went to war to put an end to slavery. Mr. Speaker. I have now in my hand a leatherbound New Testament Bible that was carried in the shirt pocket of my great uncle. John Richardson. and it is written inside here. It was presented to him on the eve of his departure for the war in July of 1862. He walked home 3 years to the day with this Bible in his shirt pocket. it having protected him. It has fly specks on it from laying open by the campfire. It has verses that are written in it. I have found his picture. his musket. his bayonet. his belt buckle. and his ink file. That is what is left of this man who committed himself to putting an end to slavery. Yet. his cousin. my five times great -grandfather. was killed in that effort. Many gave their lives to put an end to slavery. I was standing before the Lincoln Memorial. reading his second Inaugural Address. and I will read that into the RECORD. Mr. Speaker. This component is from Lincolns second Inaugural Address of March 4. 1865. when he said: Fondly do we hopefervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet. if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsmans 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword. as was said 3.000 years ago. so still it must be said: ""The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."" Mr. Speaker. these are not disputed numbers. The numbers of Americans who were killed putting an end to slavery and saving the Union: 600.000. Another number not disputed is the number of Black Africans who were brought to what is now the United States to be slaves: 600.000. I take you back to the words ""until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword . . . The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."" A huge price has been paid. It has been paid primarily by Caucasian Christians. There are many who stepped up because they profoundly believed that they needed to put an end to slavery. This country has put this behind us. It has been through this brutal and bloody battle. We have come back together for the Reconstruction. and we have healed this country together. I regret deeply that we are watching this country be divided again over a symbol of a free country. When I go to Germany and see that they have outlawed the swastika. I look at them and I think: We have a First Amendment. That cant happen here in the United States because we are open enough. We have to tolerate the desecration of Old Glory. the American flag. Yet. we have people here on the floor who say they are offended by a symbol. They are the ones who are putting it up for all to see. and then they are saying that we should outlaw that so the American people dont have a chance to see our heritage. Everything about Americas history is not glorious. Everything about our history is not right in our judgment. looking back in hindsight. but none of us know what it was like for the people who lived during that time. in that era. We can accept our history. We can be proud of our history. We can unify our country. We can grieve for those who were murdered. and we can preserve our First Amendment rights."
1140040989,"I will now shift over to the topic that I came to the floor to address. and that is the topic of the Supreme Court from the marriage decision. the decisions that actually came down from the Supreme CourtI believe it was a week ago last Thursday and Friday. On Thursday. there was a decision from the Supreme Court on ObamaCare. the King v. Burwell case. where the majority decision of the Supreme Court concluded that the law. as passed by the United States Congress. doesnt mean what it says. It means instead. according to the majority of the Supreme Court. what they think the President would have liked to have had it said if he had actually been dictating the language there. But we have to vote. Mr. Speaker. on the language that is in the bill. not the language that should have been in the head of the President and the Speaker of the House at the time. That is why we have had a Supreme Court who. over the last generation. has been textualist. This has emerged from the Rehnquist court and should have survived and been enhanced under the Roberts court. that the law means what it says and the Constitution means what it says and. furthermore. it needs to mean what it was understood to mean at the time of ratification. We do have a language that moves and changes and morphs along the way. And the language that is written into the Constitution. into the various amendments that are there and written into our laws. we cant simply say that because we have a different way we utilize language today. that somehow the people who ratified it had a meaning that conformed to the morphed language of the modern world. And I would have thought that Chief Justice Roberts would have been one of those who would have adhered to that. I can think of times when the Court has said to this Congress: You may have intended one thing. but the language in the bill that you passed and was signed into law actually means something different. So you can either live with the decision of the Court or you can set about changing the language so that the language actually does what you intended it to do. It is a simple understanding of simple construction under the law in the Constitution. An example. Mr. Speaker. would be the ban on partial birth abortion that passed here in this Congress in the nineties. It went before three Federal courts and then was appealed to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court concluded that the ban on partial birth abortion that Congress had first passed was vague in its description of the act itself and that Congress didnt have findings that partial birth abortion was not necessary to save the life of the mother. So it was struck down by the Supreme Court. and that means they sent it back to us. They said: Congress. fix that. And I got involved in that. I want to tip my hat to Congressmen STEVE CHABOT of Ohio. who was the chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee at the time. and JIM SENSENBRENNER. the chair of the full Judiciary Committee. We held hearing after hearing. We rewrote the definition of ""partial birth abortion"" so that it was precise and clear and understandable. and we complied with the Courts directive. In those hearings. we brought witnesses that put into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a mass of evidence that concluded that a partial birth abortion was never necessary to save the life of the mother. We did those things to conform to the directive of the Supreme Court because they read the text of the law. But today we have a Supreme Court that concludes thatwell. the text may say one thing. but we think the President would have preferred it to say something else. And so did most of the people. maybe. that voted to pass ObamaCare. that very partisan piece of legislation. Maybe they intended for it to say something else. too. but it didnt. So the Supreme Court inserted the words ""or Federal Government"" into the statute that said an exchange established by the State. The Supreme Court essentially wrote into that ""by State or Federal Government."" alleging that the language was vague. That is appalling to me. Mr. Speaker. to think that in the United States of America. a country ruled by the rule of law. that we could have a Supreme Court whono one has a higher charge to read the language. to understand it. to call the balls and strikes. as the Chief Justice has said. I think he forgot to say that you are supposed to also call whether it is fair or foul. Well. I think it is foul. It is a foul ball for the Supreme Court to think that they can change the language of the law. If they sent it back here. Congress then had an obligation to adjust the policy to our intent from now. maybe not the intent at the time that it was passed. because those years have moved. Then subsequent to that. the very next day. Fridaya week ago last Friday. as I recallthe Supreme Court came with a decision. a decision on same sex marriage. I have some experience with this. Mr. Speaker. and it falls along this line. In 2009. the Iowa Supreme Court. in reading the mirror of our 14th Amendment. which is in our United States Constitutionand the mirror of it is written into the Iowa State Constitutionthey concluded that samesex marriage was the law of the land in Iowa. And their conclusion was that it fell underneath the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendmentthe mirrored component of the 14th Amendment that was in our Iowa constitution. There are 63 pages in the Varnum v. Brien decision in the Iowa case. I read that decision. I read all 63 pages. But not only that. I poked through it. I read it. I looked at the ceiling. I contemplated. I looked back down at the words. I tried to absorb the kind of legal rationale that would get you to the point where you could conclude that under equal protection or due process. that marriage really was between one adult and another entity. whatever sex or gender that entity might be. And they wrote that under the protection of the 14th Amendment. the Equal Protection Clause and due process. that. quote. homosexuals have a right to public affirmation. closed quote. Mr. Speaker. I know of no place in law. I know of no place in society. I know of no place in history where there is an individual. let alone a group of people. a selflabeled group of people that have any claim to public affirmation. public approval conferred by the court. But that was the key to understanding this litigation that has moved forward since 2009. It brings us into 2015. And we have a decision in the Supreme Court that commands all States. if they are going to recognize any marriage. to recognize same sex marriage and for all States to also provide the reciprocity of recognizing marriages that take place in other States. as those individuals may come through or move into their States. That is that right of reciprocity. It is in the Constitution. reciprocity. But. Mr. Speaker. for the Supreme Court to essentially create a new right. a right to same sex marriage manufactured out of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. that was ratified in 1868and. by the way. it ties into this dialogue about the Confederate flag and all the rhetoric that we have had in this Congress all week long. It ties into it in this way: The 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution were ratified in the aftermath of the Civil War. They were established. first. the 13th Amendment. to free the slaves because the people in the legislature at the time didnt believe that a clear statute that freed the slaves was going to actually have the impact that a constitutional amendment would. So they passed the 13th Amendment to establish that there will be no slavery in the United States anywhere. ever. The second was the 14th Amendment. the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause and the clause says that all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be American citizens. All of that to ensure not only that the freed slaves would be free and they would have equal access to all their rights of citizenship but that their children would also be citizens and that they would have equal protection under the law. That was the essence of the 14th Amendment. We are asked to believe that somehow those who wrote and ratified the 14th Amendment in 1868 had secretly put some subtle language into it that they somehow knew we would discover in 2015 that says. there shall be same sex marriage in all of America. and the Supreme Court will find it. and they will impose it upon the rest of the country because they are the enlightened five of nine in black robes. Well. the Supreme Court has had a terrible record. a terrible record on dealing with large domestic issues. In 1857. Dred Scott. they thought they could resolve the slavery issue. The Supreme Court was stacked in favor of the South. Five from the South and one from Pennsylvania that was sympathetic to slavery. They had a 63 operation going on. And they essentially declared that blacks could not be citizens. and they could not be free. They could not be citizens. and they could not be freed by States. And that if a slave owner owned a slave. they owned that slave in any State that that individual might go. That was the decision of Dred Scott. They thought they had put the issue away. It came back to haunt this country over and over again. And it was part of the conflict that began in the next decade. within 1862. and that brought about the death of 600.000 Americans and split this country apart and it has taken years to put us back together. The Dred Scott decision. Fast forward 100 years. They took prayer out of the public schools. We honored that decision. We stopped praying at least openly in our public schools. Now the question is: Can a football team without the coach kneel on the grass and pray before a ball game? We are a First Amendment country. Freedom of religion. And we are dealing with this kind of assault on free religion because the Supreme Court in Murray v. Curlett in 1963 dumped that on us. 1973. Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. Then you have the Lawrence v. Texas decision. And it goes on and on and on. Mr. Speaker. Up to this point. the domestic life of America has been dramatically transformed by order of the Supreme Court. the people least connected to the will of the people. When they separate themselves from the text of the statute and the text in the understanding of the Constitution. we are in a place where the Supreme Court then has put themselves above the law. above the Constitution. and above the will of the people. One of the people that understands that as well as anybody in this United States Congress is my friend from Texas. Mr. LOUIE GOHMERT. who speaks to us often in these Chambers. I know about his marriage. and I know about his conviction to the rule of law and the Constitution. I yield to the gentleman from Texas."
1140046199,"Mr. Speaker. it is my privilege to be able to address you here on the floor of the House of Representatives and to speak some words here that hopefully will be picked up by the rest of the country that causes us to think a little more. think a little deeper. and think about the destiny of this country. Mr. Speaker. I come to the floor to talk to you this evening about a couple of topics. One is national security. and the other is the rule of law. I will say the third thing that threads into that is the Planned Parenthood videos. We have now seen three of them. as they penetrate into our conscience. Let me address first the Planned Parenthood videos. It has been now several weeks since the first video came out that showed the supposed doctor that worked for Planned Parenthood cavalierly discussing how to harvest the organs of innocent little unbornaborted. thoughbabies. and the cavalier approach to that: sitting there over dinner. chatting away as if they were talking about a soccer game or maybe talking about spending the weekend with their family. having a glass of wine and talking about taking organs out of innocent little creatures that are created in Gods image. as we all are. Mr. Speaker. That was video number one. It should have shocked us to our core to see the attitude. but it didnt confirm decisively what was actually going on. It impliedand it was fairly strong evidencebut it didnt confirm. The second video was the older lady sitting in a different restaurant. chatting along about how a transaction would be to harvest kidneys and lungs and livers and hearts and brains and body parts from innocent babies who just wanted a chance to live and love and laugh and learn. to worship. to grow. to enjoy lifeto enjoy that first right. that right to life that comes before the right to liberty. which comes before the right to the pursuit of happiness. as our Founding Fathers prioritized those rights in the Declaration of Independence. Mr. Speaker. That lady. in the second video. wanted enough out of that. that sheI will use that word again-"" cavalierly"" said: I want a Lamborghini. I am sure she would say to us: I was just joking. Well. to joke about that topic in a setting like that. that told me it wasnt just a casual conversation. There was attention being paid to the business deal that was being negotiated. and it didnt seem like it was conclusive. but there was a direction and a course for that conversation. Now. today. we see a third video. a video interviewing a young woman who has worked in a Planned Parenthood center whose task was to harvest the organs of little babies. The video shows the separation of that. shows the little feet. the little arms. the little hands. It shows the kidneys. it shows the brain. It shows the pieces of that little baby that was perfect in every way until it was torn apart by the abortionist. using a technique. a methodology that is designed to preserve the most valuable organs so that they can be sold on the market to laboratories and for medical experiments. Mr. Speaker. When I saw that video today and I saw each of the other two videos when they came out. the first day that one was available. and then I saw one. and I saw the second video as a preview before it came out to the public. Either one of those. when I was listening to the verbiage. certainly told me that there is an evil. evil element within Planned Parenthood. a cavalier attitude. a ""this is the business we do"" attitude. not a human compassion was exposed in either one of those first two videos. I have been in a lot of debates about abortion. I have read a lot of material about it. I have listened to a lot of testimony about it. Sitting on the Judiciary Committee. we moved legislation that put an end to partialbirth abortion or at least attempted to. and so we have had a lot of lifeanddeath debates in the Judiciary Committee here in the House of Representatives. When I saw the video of the young woman talking about the task that she was given. pick up these forceps and begin to separate these organs and sort them out. and these are good. and the lab will take that. and essentially. These will bring good money. lets make sure we protect them. it sickened me. It caused my gut to knot up. Mr. Speaker. in a way that reminded me of the first time I walked into a funeral home to see the dead body of a loved one. That is an experience in anybodys lifetime that you remember. Seeing this video is an experience that I will remember. As I watch this Congress and I think how Congress is reacting. I am glad that there are investigations going on. I am glad that the Speaker has spoken up on this issue. I am glad that there is a prolife movement in this country. I am glad that there are people that are protesting and there are people that are making their positions known to the Supreme Court. to the United States Congress. to the President of the United States. However intransigent the President will be on this. this is a subject that should have the immediate attention of the Department of Justice. This would be something that Loretta Lynch should be on now. should be conducting an investigation now. should be bringing about the evidence and preparing a prosecution against the people that have. essentially. admitted in the videos that they have committed a crime. perhaps multiple crimes. This isnt about there is a piece or there is an argument on one side versus an argument on the other side. Planned Parenthood says: Well. we dont do it for a profit. We just do this to get our money back out of the costs we have to preserve these organs and pass them along. After all. this poor mother is just making a contribution to science. and so we should appreciate that. That is not what the Congress thought when they passed the laws against trading in little. unborn baby body parts. Mr. Speaker. It is about the law. and the law says thou shall not do such a thing. No amount of excusing away. no amount of trying to explain that it was with a positive motive. instead of a profit motive. no amount of saying that. Well. that is just our costs. and we are recovering our cost. no amount of saying that the money that comes from the taxpayer into the pockets of Planned Parenthood doesnt ever go to abortion because it will be said now. hundreds of times. Mr. Speaker. in fact. thousands of times. it will be said: Money is fungible. Money is fungible. Money is fungible. If you dump a half a billion dollars into Planned Parenthoods coffersthat is out of the pockets of the taxpayers. We hand them the debt. borrow the money from the Chinese. hand it over to Planned Parenthood. and Planned Parenthood then uses that to run their operation to free up some of their other operations that end up being what they call an operation. which is an abortion. that is snuffing out the liveswe are closing in on 60 million little babies since Roe v. Wade in 1973. closing in on 60 million. At the same time. we have people that are arguing that we need to open up our borders and let an unlimited number of people come into America because our birthrate is not high enough to replace the people that are dying off as they reach the end of their life. Rather than to say lets bring every one of these babies to birth. give them an opportunity to fill their lungs full of free air. give them an opportunity to live. to love. to learn. to laugh. give them an opportunity to contribute to this country. to this society. rather than do that. we abort the babies and bring in people from another culture and think we are making America a better place. when we have the sin of up to 60 million abortions on our country. on our heads. on our conscience. on our Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker. and on this Congress. to a degree. the House and Senate. and certainly on the President of the United States. who said heand I will leave his family out of it. Mr. Speaker. but I think some know the thought that crossed my mind. It is time for this Congress to step up to defund Planned Parenthood. I wont be satisfied with just a moratorium of waiting around for a year while we study this situation and put together maybe a select committee that can look at it for a while longer and hold some hearings in Congress. They are going to look at the videos and listen to the testimony on both sides. All that does. Mr. Speaker. is give Planned Parenthood an opportunity to spend some of those millions of dollars. some percentage of the half a billion dollars that we send to them out of the taxpayers pocket. borrowed from the Chinese. and indebted onto the children that are born. to lobby this Congress to tell us: Well. there is really some good there at Planned Parenthood after all. and so we should continue to fund them. That is what we are faced with. Mr. Speaker. The object is this: Shut off all funding to Planned Parenthood. they should not receive one dime of taxpayer dollars further. There has been a strong movement on this over the years since the time I have been here. and the States want to move. too. Mr. Speaker. The States want to shut off funding to Planned Parenthood. They are afraid that Congress. or the President of the United States. through one of his executive edicts. will order that the funding going to a State that would cut off the funding to Planned Parenthood would be cut off itself. that their Medicaid money might be stopped by this administration if a State would deign to cut off funding and no longer subsidize Planned Parenthood. Mr. Speaker. this Congress needs to deal with this. We need to give the States all authority to cut off any funds. in the discretion of their own legislature and Governors. any funds that go to any organization that provides abortion. They will call it services or counseling. If we do that. then we can restore a component of the culture of life in this country. If we do that. we begin to respect and appreciate innocent. unborn human life. we will see families that will grow. We will see children that are cherished. We will see more and more foundation of education and faith and wholesomeness in our country. If we turn our backs on those innocent. unborn. little babies that are being systematically aborted. while we are subsidizing Planned Parenthood with borrowed tax dollars. under the guise of somehow they do some good. this is evil. Mr. Speaker. What is happening to these innocent babies and what is happening to the mothers is evil. and it is evil for profit. It is on video. and we have seen three of these videos. Mr. Speaker. We are not done yet. This Congress should not just pledge to study this for a year. This Congressand we go forward with funding for the fiscal year. next fiscal year. we have got the witching hour. September 30. at midnight. It is likely to come as a continuing resolution. That continuing resolution has to have in it the language that will cut off the funding to Planned Parenthood. I will cut it off to any organization that provides abortion. as they say. services or counseling. That subject is on the front of my mind. Mr. Speaker. and I wanted to get that off of my chest."
1140051217,"Madam Speaker. I rise to express several serious concerns with the flawed process that led to a flawed product. H.R. 3134. the ""Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015."" Ten shocking videos released over the last few months document what many already knew was happening at Planned Parenthood facilities around our nationthe selling and trafficking of fetal organs for a profit. For the vast majority of Americans who view human life as sacred. these videos halve caused righteous anger and disgust that the taxpayersubsidized ""nonprofit organization"" is not only extinguishing human life but also making money off of human partsat the taxpayers expense. This is the moment for the prolife movement to hold this evil organization accountable by completely and unequivocally defunding Planned Parenthood. Rather than fighting to protect life and actually defunding Planned Parenthood. we are voting today on a weak bill. without teeth. that does not defund Planned Parenthood. H.R. 3134 only places a oneyear moratorium on federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Furthermore. it includes exceptions to continue to allow taxpayer dollars to go to Planned Parenthood and its abortion factories. With all we know about what goes on at Planned Parenthoods abortion factories. why are we voting on a bill to ""defund"" Planned Parenthood for one year? Whats worse. H.R. 3134 does not defund Planned Parenthood. The exceptions included in this bill allow taxpayer dollars to be used to fund abortions performed at Planned Parenthood. In effect. this bill is a proactive vote by the GOPcontrolled House of Representatives to affirmatively fund abortions at Planned Parentlgd facilities. The very bill leadership has promoted as the solution to this grisly problemthe taxpayer funded mutilation of fully formed childrenactually rubber stamps the existing situation. Furthermore. the certification process in this bill is ripe for fraud and abuse. All Planned Parenthood needs to do is certify it is already following federal law and the Hyde Amendment to continue to receive funding. Who ensures this certification? Once Planned Parenthood receives federal funding and is found to violate this Act. what is the process for the executive branch to seek repayment of this money? H.R. 3134 does not go far enough to address concerns for fraud and abuse. Because of my serious concerns with the substance of H.R. 3134. I offered an amendment to the Rules Committee on Wednesday. September 16. 2015. My amendment states: ""No funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law may be made available for any purpose to-(1) Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Inc.. (2) any affiliate or clinic of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Inc.. or (3) any successor of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Inc. or any such affiliate or clinic."" My amendment is simple: no federal funds to Planned Parenthood. Period. No oneyear moratorium. No exceptions. That should be the goal of this debate and any legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. Unfortunately. the Rules Committee did not approve my amendment for debate on the floor or adopt it as part of the underlying bill. If my amendment was considered on the floor. I am confident that my colleagues would have overwhelming support and adopted my amendment into the underlying bill. The funding fight starts nowthis is our markerH.R. 3134 is not a sufficient vote to defund Planned Parenthood. I expect much stronger language than this in the CR coming up in the next few weeks. Innocent. unborn babies deserve more than just a show vote. For these reasons. I will cast a present vote."
1140060996,Mr. Chairman. this is an amendment that I have offered in the past. and it will be known as the amendment that eliminates the effect of the DavisBacon Act. The substance of it is this: None of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement. administer. or enforce the prevailing rate of wage. which is the effect of this amendment. and it is effectively the DavisBacon Act. It seems to get the attention of some of my colleagues. I would say. Mr. Chairman. that I have worked with this issue as long as anyone in the United States Congress. I have worked back for years. as I began about 5 years in the construction site as an employee. Multiple times I received DavisBacon wage scales. sometimes I did not. As I became a contractor in 1975. we began hiring employees. Sometimes we paid DavisBacon wage scales. and sometimes we did not. but I was always aggravated by the Federal Governments deciding that they knew what we had to pay our help and what they were worth. I recall many debates on the floor of the House of Representatives when people from the other side of the aisle would say that anytime there is a relationship between two or more people that are consenting adults. the Federal Government has no business sticking themselves in the middle of that relationship. Yet the DavisBacon Act tells me what my son. who is now sitting in the gallery. has to pay me if I am going to climb in the seat of one of his machines. say an excavator. a scraper. a bulldozer. or a motor grader. So we are 40 years in the construction business. I have watched the inefficiencies that are created by the DavisBacon Act. You might need somebody on a shovel. and he decides it pays more to get on a motor grade. or you might need somebody on a scraper. and he decides it pays more to get on a bulldozer. This wrecks the efficiency as well as puts an extra high price on the cost of the products that are being produced under the contracting business in the United States. So I would say this. Mr. Chairman. that over our years in the construction business. the extra costs for DavisBacon ranges somewhere between 8 and 38 percent additional. depending on the type of project and the location where you are. The average is someplace between 20 and 22 percent. So to boil this all down. if we want to be responsible to the taxpayer. then we want to get the best dollar out of that. Somebody is going to say that it is secondrate work. That would be a direct insult to me. It would be a direct insult to my son. who owns King Construction today and who is listening to this debate. Our quality work stands with anyones. and it is superior to many. and sometimes it is DavisBacon wage scale. and sometimes it is not. But we know what they are worth. The government doesnt know what they are worth. We want to hire the best help. keep the best help. and keep the best help on. That is just here in this microcosm of King Construction. but it is extrapolated across the Nation. So do we want to build 4 miles of road under governmentmandated wages or do we want to build 5? I want to build the 5 miles. I want to build five bridges. not four. I want the best dollar for the taxpayers. and I want the highest efficiency that we can get. That is the substance of this amendment. and I urge its adoption. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140068910,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Meansand I am delighted he is the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Meansfor yielding. I rise in support of the conference report of the Customs bill. It has got many provisions within it which I am happy about and happy to support. The currency manipulation provision is one of them. I am pleased to be here to be able to say that there were those that had significant heartburn over trade promotion authority. I am one of them. There were two provisions that I so badly wanted to be included within the TPA legislation. because I have a bit of a history of working to keep the immigration components out of trade deals. Congress needs to be passing immigration law. not trade negotiators. Well. that language is an amendment that is in here in the conference report. along with language that prohibits the negotiations under trade promotion authority on climate change. So we are protected from executive decisions imposed upon this Congress and a usurpation of article I authority by two pieces of language in here: No negotiations under TPA can include climate change under this language. and no negotiations under TPA can include immigration. Congress can speak to that. but they cannot negotiate that under TPA. That is very important to me. It is important to a lot of people across this country. I am standing here saying thank you to nowSpeaker RYAN. who negotiated this with me and others. He regrets that he wasnt able to shake my hand as chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. That is fine with me. Mr. Speaker. I am happy to shake the hand of KEVIN BRADY as chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. and say to a number of people who had significant apprehension about whether this would come together on all of the language necessary to get support for trade promotion authority. to say to them upon the passage of this conference report here today and the anticipated signature. merry Christmas to all of you who wanted to step down the line to preserve article I authority for the United States Congress.
1140108199,Mr. Chairman. my amendment is an amendment that I have brought in past years. What it does. it says none of the funds made available by this act. including the amendments made by this act. may be used to implement. administer. or enforce a prevailing rate of wage requirements in subchapter 4. which is basically referred to normally as the DavisBacon Act. The DavisBacon Act is a bill that was passed back in the early 1930s. The purpose of it was to lock the labor out from Alabama that was going. during the Depression years. up into New York to build Federal buildings and competing with the labor unions up there that happened to be locking Black workers out of the workforce in New York. It was brought to us by a Senator and by a House Member from New Yorkboth Republicans. by the way. It is the remaining Jim Crow law that I know of on the books. and it imposes what is called a prevailing wage on all contractors doing Federal contracts that are $2.000 or more. King Construction has been in business since 1975. That is 41 years. We have dealt with this DavisBacon wage scale for a long time. Not only is it expensive. and it costs the taxpayers extra money on every single project on which it is imposed. but it also brings about inefficiencies that are brought about because of the reporting requirements. the confusion that is there. We happen to have seen on our jobs people that jump from machine to machine to try to get to the highest paying machine. not the most efficient one. That is just one picture of what DavisBacon does. There are many others. Our numbers from our company are someplace between 8 and 35 percent. depending on your project. that the cost of these projects are increased unnecessarily. It does not reflect prevailing wage. It reflects an imposed union scale. This is something that this Congress has to come to grips with if we are going to ever get to balance and be responsible with the taxpayer dollars. I urge its adoption. I reserve the balance of my time.

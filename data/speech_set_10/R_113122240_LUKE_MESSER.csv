1130052411,Mr. Speaker. there is a lot we disagree on around here. By now virtually every American knows that we disagree on ObamaCare. We ought not allow what divides us to stop us from coming together on issues where we all agree. There is nothing political about passing bills to help sick kids or pay our troops or open our national parks. or bills to help lowincome women and children. In recent days. the House has passed bipartisan bills to fund the areas of government like those I just discussed where we all agree. Each of these bills passed the House with dozens of votes from my Democratic colleagues. Each of these bills were unilaterally rejected by Senate Leader HARRY REID. The President has publicly declared that he will veto any of these bills if they reach his desk. Let me repeat: the House in recent days has passed bills to help sick children. pay our troops. open our national parks and help lowincome women and children. Dozens of my Democratic colleagues have voted for those bills. And the President and HARRY REID refuse to have them even considered. Why? It is awfully cynical to oppose helping people who are being hurt by the government shutdown. a shutdown. by the way. caused by the Presidents refusal to participate in the democratic process and negotiate. Clearly. President Obama and Senator REID are putting political leverage before the American people. and that is wrong. This shouldnt be about politics. It shouldnt be about the inside baseball games of Washington and whos going to win and whos going to lose in this debate. it should be about the American people. We have very big areas in which we disagree. This is a time where that debate is coming to a head. Many of us believe the Federal Government is far too big. Many of us are concerned about a Federal Government that is $17 trillion in debt and robbing the next generation of their opportunity to live the American Dream. Many of us are concerned about ObamaCare and what it will mean to live in an America where government is in charge of 17 percent of our economy. Some on the other side of the aisle. disagree on each of those issues. but we do have areas where we agree. Common sense dictates that we would act on them. I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue supporting these commonsense proposals. and I urge Senator REID and the President to do the right thing and allow those bills to become law. The American people dont want a government shutdown. but they also dont want the Presidents health care law. Its time for both parties to listen to the people. work out our differences. and find a common way forward.
1130053637,Mr. Speaker. Irish leader Henry Boyle once said: The most important trip you can make in life is meeting people halfway. Unfortunately. in this debate. the President and HARRY REIDs latest offers are way short of halfway. They wont even come to the negotiating table. During this shutdown. the Republicans in the House have passed nine bills to fund and reopen vital functions of government. Let me go through some of them for you: Twentyfive of my Democratic colleagues voted with House Republicans to fund pediatric cancer research. Twentythree of my Democrats colleagues voted with Republicans to reopen national parks. memorials. and monuments. Thirtyfive of my Democratic colleagues voted with Republicans. honoring our promise to give veterans the benefits they have earned. Thirtysix of my Democratic colleagues voted with Republicans to pay our National Guard and Army Reserve personnel. Twentythree of my Democratic colleagues voted with Republicans to make sure funds are available to provide disaster relief. and One hundred eightynine of my Democratic colleagues voted with House Republicans to provide backpay for furloughed Federal employees. Each of these are reasonable proposals. yet HARRY REID insists that virtually all of them will not be considered in the Senate. and the President has threatened a veto. Let me repeat. House Republicans have passed bills to fund pediatric cancer research. reopen national parks. provide benefits to veterans. pay salaries for our National Guard. fund disaster relief programs and other vital services. Dozens of my Democratic colleagues have voted for each of these bills. yet the President and HARRY REID wont budge. The American people are disappointed in this shutdownafter all. this is not the way government is supposed to workbut the American people are also figuring this out. This shutdown can end if HARRY REID and President Obama meet House Republicans at the negotiating tablebut their chairs sit empty. The American people dont want the Presidents health care law. but they are ready for this shutdown to end. Its time for both parties to listen to the American people. work out our differences. and find a commonsense way forward.
1130054937,"I want to thank my colleague and friend from Illinois. Congressman DAVIS. for his incredible leadership on this issue. I know of nobody in Congress who is working harder for the American family farmer than Congressman DAVIS. This Special Order today is just one more example of your leadership. Farming is hard work. and it is vital to Indiana. Ag industries contribute almost $38 billion a year to the Hoosier economy. supporting nearly 190.000 jobs. The farmers who provide these jobs work from dawn until way past dusk and face great risks when withering droughts or excess rains threaten to wreck their crops. Despite these challenges. Hoosier farmers manage to overcome adversity. succeed in their businesses. and feed the world. Too often. their work is made even harder because of uncertainties and inefficiencies in Federal farm policy. The problems with Federal farm laws are many: Price supports inflate the prices of some consumer goods. payments are made to people not actually farming. outdated and duplicative programs waste money that could be put to better use. rules regarding disaster assistance are too complicated. and they fail to provide enough certainty about whether and what return farmers will receive when they reinvest any profits in their family business. Many are surprised that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. commonly called ""food stamps."" is administered by the Department of Agriculture. the USDA. Most agree the program is not well managed. It pays too many people who should not be eligible for help. diverting help from those who really need the assistance. There arent enough incentives to encourage people to find work. and there is too much waste. fraud. and abuse. Thats why we need a farm bill. The farm bill which passed the House is not perfect. but it would save $40 billion over the next decade. in part. by repealing or consolidating more than 100 programs that dont work. could work better. or are duplicative in purpose. The bill would stop the nonsense policy of paying people not to farm. Instead. it would give farmers greater flexibility to utilize federally backed crop insurance to manage risk. It also would require food stamp recipients to work more. get drug tested. and become selfsufficient. American icon Paul Harvey once said: And. on the eighth day. God looked down on his planned paradise and said. ""I need a caretaker."" and so God made the farmer. Others have spoken about how important it is that we stand up and be a champion for those who farm. A defeat of the farm bill maintains the status quo. We need a conference. and we need a farm bill. A defeat would hurt farmers and taxpayers. but both need the certainty of knowing that farm and nutrition assistance programs work as they should so scarce taxpayer resources arent wasted on food stamp fraud or on programs that just dont work. We need commonsense farm reform policy to prevent waste and to make sure the next generation of farmers gets its chance to run the family farm."
1130062362,"Thank you. Once again. I appreciate the gentlemans leadership. I appreciate your longstanding leadership on this important issue and your longtime leadership in Texas as well. As you have said. nobody wants to say. ""I told you so."" but. unfortunately. what has unfolded in the most recent weeks and months is exactly what was predicted by folks on your committee and elsewhere because you could see from the beginning that the bill was fundamentally flawed and just didnt work. I want to cite to this Chamber the number 701. According to the Department of Health and Human Services. that is the number of Hoosiers who have successfully signed up for health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Indiana isnt alone. States across the country are experiencing dismal enrollment numbers. What is worse is that millions of Americans. including 108.000 Hoosiers. are getting policy cancelation notices from their health insurance companies. These notices are coming at a faster rate than people are able to sign up for the health care plans under the Presidents health care bill. The President called a press conference once again last week to announce to the American people that. if you like your health care plan. you can keep it. The problem is. no matter how many times the President makes that promise. the promise still isnt true. Saying the promise over and over again doesnt magically make it true. One of my constituents. Michael Sturgis of Greensburg. called to let me know that he received a cancelation letter from his insurance company. He was told his monthly premium was going to increase from $397 a month to $831 a monthan almost $500 increase per month. His $5.000 deductible will now go up to $7.300. So he is spending more money for a plan that gives him less. This is unacceptable. and it is certainly not affordable. That is why we need to pass the American Health Care Reform Act. It is so people like Michael and the millions of Americans like him all across this country can remain in charge of their own health care. Now I would like to yield to a colleague of mine. another person who has shown great leadership on this important issue and who is a close personal friend of mine as well. the gentleman from North Carolina ."
1130062370,"Again. I thank the gentleman. Thank you for your leadership. As we have talked about before. the American people needed health care reform before the disaster of ObamaCare rolled out. Obviously. we need it now more than ever given the failings of recent days. H.R. 3121. the American Health Care Reform Act. is an answer. There are several principles upon which we should all be able to agree when it comes to genuine health care reform. First. patients should not be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions. Second. any Federal policy changes must be designed to drive costs down. not up. as we have seen under the socalled Affordable Care Act. Third. you should be able to keep your health care plan if you like it. I agree with former President Bill Clinton when he has said that. given that very clear promise that was made by President Obama on behalf of the Federal Government to the American people. we need to pass legislationwe have already passed a bill in the Housebut we need to pass legislation that makes sure that promise is kept. Fourth. we need commonsense medical liability reform that puts an end to the expensive system of defensive medicine that we have now. Health care decisions should be left up to you and your doctor. not Washington bureaucrats. The American Health Care Reform Act is centered on these five principles. Frivolous lawsuits are driving up health care costs and forcing good doctors out of the medical field. The American Health Care Reform Act improves medical liability law. Frankly. Indiana has been a leader in this area because of leadership from former Governor ""Doc"" Bowen. a physician back in the 1960s. The Indiana medical malpractice reform approach would be a great Federal model. and its principles from that plan is a part of H.R. 3121. which we are talking about today. We need improved medical liability law that allows doctors to continue practicing medicine without fear of excessive and unfair penalties. I also would like to talk to you a little bit about the importance of medical savings accounts. Fellow Hoosier Pat Rooney is known as the ""father of health savings accounts"" from his work as the president and CEO of Golden Rule. They were established in 2003 while Pat Rooney was the chairman of the Golden Rule Insurance Company. Pat believed people should own their own health care. Health savings accounts have proven to be a useful tool for individuals and families while navigating the health care system. Our plan. H.R. 3121. expands health savings accounts and enhances their performance by increasing the cap on contributions and expanding the allowable uses of health savings account funds. This gives people more control over how they spend their health care dollars and allows them to invest pretax dollars toward their future health care needs. Mr. Speaker. no one doubts that real reform is needed. but there are two distinct visions for the future of health care in our Nation. The Presidents plan expands the Federal Governments role in health care. raises taxes. and imposes unfair and unworkable mandates on the American people. Our plan. H.R. 3121. the American Health Care Reform Act. puts people in charge of their own health care. It encourages competition to lower costs and expand coverage. American families. businesses. and individuals deserve real solutions to the very serious problems that exist in health care in America today. The American Health Care Reform Act provides a path to true reform. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130085008,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the career of two extraordinary Indiana State legislators: Senators Allen Paul and Johnny Nugent. These two close friends have served the State of Indiana for decades. I want to personally thank them for all of their hard work and recognize them for their many accomplishments. First. let me tell you a little bit about Senator Allen Paul. Allen volunteered for the U.S. Army in 1967 and is a decorated Vietnam veteran. He was awarded the Bronze Star for saving a mans life and also earned a Combat Infantry Badge and four Air Medals. After being honorably discharged from the Army. Allen was elected to the State senate in 1986. where he was a tireless advocate for military members and their families. He passed important legislation to help veterans receive a college degree and supported legislation to offer instate tuition for veterans. Senator Paul has the distinction of being the first legislator from eastern Indiana to serve in a leadership position within his caucus. During his 28year tenure in the senate. he served as majority whip. chairman of the Insurance Committee and chair of the Financial Institutions Committee. His political savvy and institutional knowledge will certainly be missed by his colleagues in the State legislature. Senator Pauls dear friend Senator Johnny Nugent has also decided to retire after more than 30 years in office. He too is a veteran of the U.S. Army and Army Reserve. At the age of 26. Johnny was elected Dearborn County commissioner. the youngest commissioner ever elected in Indiana. As a State senator. Johnny Nugent held numerous leadership positions. including majority floor leader. chair of the Agricultural and Small Business Committee and ranking member of the Insurance and Financial Institutions Committee. Senator Nugent has been a tireless defender of the Second Amendment and served two terms on the NRAs board of directors. During his tenure in the senate. he successfully sponsored Indianas ""Castle Doctrine."" as well as the Nations first lifetime concealedcarry permit. Senator Nugent is also known for his involvement in his local community. He is a member of the Dearborn County Chamber of Commerce and the southeastern Indiana Shrine Club. He also served on the Dearborn County Hospital board of trustees. Both Allen Paul and Johnny Nugent serve as shining examples of what it means to be a public servant. I ask the entire Sixth Congressional District to join me in recognizing these two outstanding Hoosier legislators. I have no doubt these great men will bring the same commitment. dedication. and enthusiasm that they have had during their service to their constituents and their communities. and apply that in the next chapter of their lives."
1130087550,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor National Autism Awareness Month. Modern science has helped control or eliminate many once deadly and debilitating diseases and conditions. but our understanding of autism remains an unsolved puzzle. More children than ever are being diagnosed with communication and behavioral disorders that lead to a diagnosis of autism. Autism now affects one in every 68 children. according to the CDC. My nephew Trey is one of them. I have seen firsthand how autism strains families. stretches their resources. and makes life more challenging in many ways. I have also seen the amazing joy that an autistic child can bring to a family. Trey has sure brought a lot of joy to ours. Families with autistic children do everything they can to help their kids maximize their Godgiven abilities. whatever they choose to be. but it is not always easy. especially in a world where many dont understand the unique challenges that autism presents. Helping these families better navigate this treacherous world would make a huge difference for my brother and his family and millions like them. but doing so would be much more than just helpful to those families. It would be good policy too. That is because autism imposes tremendous costs on families. many of which are shared by the schools their children attend and the many medical and developmental specialists involved in their care. Studies have found that it can cost parents up to $21.000 a year to care for a child with autism. more than it requires for one without. Children with autism have annual medical expenditures that exceed those without autism by up to $6.000 a year. The average medical cost for Medicaidenrolled children with autism are about six times higher than for children without autism. In addition to medical costs. intensive behavioral interventions for children with autism can cost $40.000 to $60.000 per child. per year. There are several steps that Congress can take right now to help ease these burdens for families. The House should pass H.R. 647. the Achieving a Better Life Experience. or ABLE. Act. which is legislation I have cosponsored. to allow for the creation of taxexempt savings accounts for individuals with disabilities. Congress also must reauthorize the Combating Autism Act. which expires in September. This vital legislation provides Federal support for critical autism research. services. and treatment. Mr. Speaker. I have often said that autism is the polio of our time. and together. as a Nation. we can beat this challenging disease. Families struggling with autism face challenges that many of us cant imagine. They neither need nor want our pity. but they deserve our help. National Autism Awareness Month. which ends tomorrow. should serve as a call to action for us to address the urgent and longterm needs of people affected by autism and. hopefully. one day. piece together the autism puzzle. so as few children as possible are impacted by this disorder.
1130091290,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their leadership on this bill. I rise today to offer a simple amendment that will encourage the opening. replication. and expansion of high quality secondary charter schools. Too many students dont have the chance to attend the secondary charter school of their choice because there simply are not enough of these schools to meet the demand for them. Many charter networks dont have a secondary school. and where there are such schools the demand for the spots in these schools exceeds the number of slots available. The underlying bill takes a big step in the right direction to meet this challenge by clarifying that Statedetermined weighted lotteries are permitted under the charter school program. The bill allows for children to continue in the school program of their choice by ensuring students in affiliated charter schools can attend the next immediate grade in a charter school network. This is very important. It will help alleviate the need for students to essentially win the lottery twice. However. I believe more can and must be done. My amendment is designed to help build on the progress made by the underlying bill. It would simply require State entities applying for charter school program grant funds to explain how they will work with eligible applicants within the State to encourage the opening. replication. and expansion of high quality secondary charter schools. By encouraging grantees to open. replicate. and expand high quality secondary charter schools. more students who want to continue attending such schools will be able to do so. As the founder and chairman of the Congressional School Choice Caucus. one of my top priorities is ensuring that more families have access to high quality educational opportunities. Supporting the growth of successful secondary charter schools is critically important to this effort. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130102451,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4631. the Autism CARES Act. which reauthorizes the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act. I want to commend my colleague. Representative CHRIS SMITH. for bringing this measure forward. Our understanding of autism remains an unsolved puzzle. More children than ever are being diagnosed with communication and behavior disorders that lead to a diagnosis of autism. Though our understanding of autism is limited. what we do know is that autism affects too many children. strains families. costs too much. and puts those it afflicts at an educational. professional. and social disadvantage compared to their peers. Families with autistic children do everything they can to help their kids maximize their Godgiven abilities whatever those may be. But its not always easy especially in a world where many dont understand the unique challenges autism presents. Helping these families better navigate this treacherous world would make a huge difference. The Autism CARES Act provides federal support for critical autism research by reauthorizing research programs at the National Institute of Health. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services. The bill will help better coordinate federal autism research and ensure more focused efforts to maximize the benefits of the resources we invest in such research. This bill also will begin efforts to determine how best to meet the needs of young adults with autism as they face the new challenges that come with being an adult. These investments are extremely important because autism imposes tremendous emotional and financial costs on families and economic impact on the health care system. The investments called for by this bill will pale in comparison to the personal and financial benefits they will yield in the future. Families struggling with autism face challenges many of us cant imagine. They need and deserve our help. It is time to commit ourselves to solving this puzzle today so autism can be prevented. treated. and cured tomorrow. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan measure.

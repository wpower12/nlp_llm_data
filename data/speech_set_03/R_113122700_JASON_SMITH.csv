1130038482,"I appreciate it. I want to thank my good friend from Georgia. Its a great honor being in this Chamber for 42 days. I definitely have some issues that are quite important to me. Madam Speaker. one issue that I would like to highlight tonight is an issue that threatens my district. Its the National Blueways System. It was conceived on May 24. 2012. by Interior Department Secretary Salazar. The National Blueways System is described as ""a headwaters to mouth approach to rivers management"" and ""a mechanism to encourage stakeholders to integrate their land and water stewardship efforts by adopting a watershed approach."" Importantly. a river is supposed to be nominated for a Blueways designation by local stakeholders. Though no local stakeholders from my district were included in the nomination process. the White River Watershed. of which 14 counties are in my district. was named as the Nations second National Blueways in January of this year. Who nominated the White River to become a Blueways? The National Wildlife Refuge Association. an organization based in Washington. D.C. A quick trip to their Web site reveals that in addition to being based in Washington. D.C.. around a thousand miles away from the White River Watershed. not a single member of their board of directors is from Arkansas or Missouri. Wheres the local knowledge? How is this organization a stakeholder? Local stakeholders eventually found out about the designation and they were furious. as you can imagine. And when I use the term local stakeholders. I mean groups and individuals living in the watershed. including public officials elected to represent those individuals. Why were they furious? Typically. Federal designations bring along with them rules and regulations that affect the landowners. These rules and regulations might restrict access to the rivers in my district that are used for recreational purposes and fuel our tourist economy. These rules and regulations might also restrict farmers and ranchers from being able to access the water they need for their crops and livestock. Im pleased to note that the White River National Blueways nomination was recently withdrawn. due in large part to significant outcry from Missourians let out of the process. We were also informed today that the entire National Blueways System has been paused and put under review. But I want to make something very clear here tonight: simply pausing the program until the folks back home forget about it and then trying to restart these designations is deplorable. I urge the Interior Department to quickly complete its review and define that the entire Blueways System needs to be scrapped. Madam Speaker. we also discussed the National Blueways System further today in two hearings. In the first. Secretary Jewell. Secretary Salazars newly appointed successor. noted that ""she did not know very much about the Blueways System."" When I asked her today who the relevant authority on the Blueways System was. she said that it was ""Rebecca Wodder."" Unfortunately. for those of us who would have liked to ask the Interior Department questions about the Blueways today. Rebecca Wodder refused to come to our subcommittee hearing. As we noted in our hearings today. the process for designating these ""National Blueways"" has not always been voluntary. open. or public. It is disturbing that Ms. Wodder continues to refuse to testify about this program before our committee. Though the program is often trumpeted as voluntary. open. and public. Ms. Wodder has never been interested in making her comments voluntary. open. or public about the designations. Madam Speaker. let me provide you with a little more background about the district that I proudly represent. Missouris Eighth Congressional District. It contains 30 counties in southeastern and southern Missouri. We range from 40 miles south of the city of St. Louis. down the mighty Mississippi River. the entire Bootheel region. all the way west to about 40 miles east of Springfield. and in the northwest corner. the Phelps County. Rolla area. My district is agriculturally diverse. We grow everything from citrus to sugar. Fourteen of the 30 counties in my district contain land that would have been within the ""White River National Blueways"" designation. In addition. my district includes the Ozark National Scenic Riverway. a National Park Service entity that spans through five counties on the western side. including my home county near my home of Salem. The parts of our local economy that are not driven by agriculture rely heavily on tourism and natural resources. Folks come from all over the State and all around the country to be guided on float trips on the rivers and streams contained in my district. We have a thriving timber industry that produces lumber. charcoal. and finished wood products. and some of the districts largest employers mine lead and smelt aluminum. What is the common thread that ties together the components of agriculture. tourism. and natural resources in my district? It is property rights. and our ability to use the land and its bounty to make a living. All too often. the Federal Government tugs at this thread. threatening to unwind the fabric of our economy. Whether it is new regulations restricting farm labor. new EPA carbon emission rules that would shutter our largest employers. or shutting down access and restricting the use of our rivers and streams in my district. my district is under attack. My constituents and I are tired of unelected Washington. D.C.. bureaucrats creating new programs out of thin air and having the ability to end our way of life and the way that we make a living. While the White River National Blueways has been withdrawn. it is only the latest symptom of a disease that has embedded itself into the very core of this administration. They think that they know better than locals. and they think that they can act on their own without congressional approval or oversight. Where does it stop? Madam Speaker. today. I challenge the Members of this body to make it our goal not only to stop the National Blueways System all over this country but also to fight the disease that spawned it. Local groups and individuals are best situated to manage their lands and resources. We dont need bureaucratic mandates sent from on high in Washington. D.C.. that may have drastic repercussions for our local economies."
1130046695,Mr. Chairman. I commend the Congressman for recognizing the need to correct a major supply chain vulnerability in the United States. that of critical and strategic minerals. Many of us in Congress only heard of the concept of strategic minerals after we became lawmakers. Most of the time. we hear about exotic elements at the bottom of the periodic table like neodymium and europium. but the fact is that we are facing down potentially devastating supply disruptions for a much more familiar material. lead. In my district. we know a lot about lead because my district produces more lead than any other district in the Nation. We rely on lead for everything from bullets. missiles. ships and tanks. to batteries for vehicles and energy storage. to TV and computer screens. to storing nuclear waste. Almost every one of us drives a car powered by a leadacid battery. It may be hard to believe that lead could be a strategic vulnerability for the United States because we have used it in so many products for over a century. Over the past generation. we have taken lead out of things like gasoline and paint to help protect human health. But the fact is lead is still crucial as a critical material that we use safely in a vast number of Americanmanufactured technologies. There is only one primary lead producer remaining in the United States today. and that facility is scheduled to close at the end of 2013. And environmental regulations are making it more and more difficult for lead producers to extract and process economically. Today. China produces three times the lead that the United States produces. and our global market share is shrinking. At the same time. global demand for lead is expected to grow by 5 to 6 percent a year. increasing prices and competition for our domestic resources. American innovators are working hard to improve the efficiency of lead production and make sure as many leadacid batteries as possible are recycled so their contents can be repurposed. But the U.S. simply cannot meet its national security needs and commercialize important new technologies without a more robust. secure supply. I hope that H.R. 761 will open doors for lead production in the United States. and that any future legislative efforts on critical minerals will also account for lead supplies.
1130047745,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me begin first by saying I fully support increasing the timber harvest on Federal lands. and Im excited for the opportunity to create jobs and stimulate the economy in my rural Missouri district. The issue that my amendment deals with. prescribed fires within the Mark Twain National Forest. is a symptom of the larger problem that H.R. 1526 seeks to fix. To put it simply. our national forest system could be better managed. Fifty million board feet of timber. with an estimated value of $4.75 million. dies every year in the Mark Twain National Forest. Only 38 million board feet of timber. with an estimated value of $4.37 million. is harvested. There are individuals ready. willing. and able to harvest the timber. but they are prevented from acting by the Federal Government. The Forest Service has made the harvest problem even worse by burning whole swaths of harvestable acreage. While prescribed fire has been used in the past as an effective technique to manage and prevent forest fires. in this instance the fires are being used to change the landscape of the area from its current forested state to pineoak woodlands. I have personally visited sites where trees that could be harvested for timber are being burned. Folks. it just doesnt make sense to be burning this timber that could be used to bring new jobs and economic prosperity to my district. The forest products industry in my district is alive and well. and we certainly could make use of these trees that are instead being burned. The wood flooring. the barrel industry. and timber and charcoal industries are major employers in my district that will put people back to work turning these trees into valuable finished products. My constituents who have evaluated the impacts of the initial prescribed fires are very concerned about the results. The large size of the burns and the failure to utilize cut hardwoods has created a residual forest condition with scorched trees and bare mineral soil. A number of trees the burns intended to promote were exposed to excessive heat. which has caused these trees to die unnecessarily. The burns have also caused the forest floor to become more susceptible to erosion. As a result of this situation. we need to place a moratorium on these prescribed fires in the Mark Twain National Forest until such time as their effects on the forest can be determined. I wrote a letter to the Forest Service in August. along with five of my colleagues from Missouri. seeking this information and have yet to receive a response. I ask this body to approve my amendment so that we can get more information from the Forest Service about this situation and that in the meantime more of our valuable Missouri hardwoods will not be indiscriminately burned.
1130052748,Thank you very much. Its a great honor to be here this evening to talk about the effects that ObamaCare has on the folks in rural Missouri. I also want to thank my colleague and my neighbor just west of me in Missouri. Congresswoman VICKY HARTZLER. for having us and for putting on this Special Order. Just over a week ago. I posted a question on my Facebook page asking the folks back home to give me examples and comments of how ObamaCare has affected them. Its amazing. We were inundated with people and just different story after story. I want to share a few of those stories of real families that are facing the struggles of ObamaCare back home. We have folks all the time that ask. Is the fight worth it? Is the fight worth defunding and delaying ObamaCare? And Ill let you all decide. But let me give you a few examples. Paul from East Prairie. down in Missouri County. in Missouri. wrote on Facebook that he checked to see what his insurance premiums would be next year after ObamaCare completely goes into effect. Paul and his family would be forced to pay $1.035 a month. with a skyhigh deductible of $12.700. Paul said he could get coverage from his wifes employerhis wife is a teacherbut with increased costs. The employers insurance for their family plan would take his wifes entire paycheck because of the new regulations under the Affordable Care Act. which is everything but affordable. Madam Speaker. I ask. Is the fight to defund ObamaCare worth it? Let me give you another example. Another constituent. Noel. said he has worked for 35 hours every year for the last 12 years. But. guess what. his employer now has changed it to where he only works 28 hours a week. Guess why? Because of the new regulations under ObamaCare. Is the fight worth it for Noel? Donald from Festus. Missouri. just south of St. Louis. told me that his health care premiums are rising from $480 to $740 per month. He went on to say that because of his increased insurance costs. he will be contributing $3.000 less a year to our Nations economy. Madam Speaker. do you think fighting ObamaCare is worth it? These are just a few examples of my constituents. These are real people. President Obama. These are people that are affected and are required to be in this program. which you are not required to be a part of. which the Vice President of the United States is not required to be a part of. which NANCY PELOSI and HARRY REID are not required to be a part of. This is wrong. folks. This is completely wrong. In the last week. this body has voted to defund and to delay ObamaCare because it is worth the fight. Democrats in the United States Senate must now justify to the American people why the individual mandate is too harmful for businesses and unions. but should still be forced on families and individuals. The Senate must justify why special interests are eligible for waivers and delays while average Americans will be hit with an ObamaCares tsunami of mandates. fines. and confusion. Madam Speaker. the fight to defund ObamaCare is a good fight to have. and I will keep fighting until folks in my district are treated the same way as big businesses and special interests. Madam Speaker. this fight is about fairness. The fight is about families in my district who are seeing skyrocketing insurance premiums and lost wages and lost jobs. Madam Speaker. this is a fight worth fighting for.
1130073329,Mr. Chairman. thank you for the opportunity to present this amendment to H.R. 3590 today. the Sportsmens Heritage And Recreational Enhancement Act. As a member of the Natural Resources Committee. I couldnt be prouder of the work that we have done to continue to protect our sportsmens ability to enjoy the outdoors. As such. I am honored to offer my amendment that would ensure that sportsmen will continue to be able to use motorized vessels in the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. a national park contained wholly within my congressional district in southern Missouri. The Ozark National Scenic Riverways is a popular destination in Missouri for fishing. gigging. and trapping. These activities have traditionally been undertaken by individuals and families for generations. An economy has arisen in my district selling boats. motors. and other products to folks who want to gig. fish. and trap within the rivers. Recently. the National Park Service has been discussing closing down areas of the park to motorized vessels and further limiting the horsepower of these vessels in other areas. The reduction of boat motor horsepower would limit the number of folks who could be on a boat and restrict access to families. Banning motorized vessels from areas of the park where they are currently allowed would further restrict the publics use and enjoyment of the park. Banning motorized vessels would also exclude groups from using the rivers that simply have no other options. like the elderly and disabled veterans. Why would the Park Service resort to such drastic measures to block activities that are currently allowed? One explanation is that they dont want folks to be able to utilize the river as they have for the past decades. My amendment would simply preserve the current park regulations as they are now and how they have been for the last five decades. preventing the Park Service from regulating sportsmen off the river. The Ozark National Scenic Riverways was created for the enjoyment of the public. and it should stay with the public.

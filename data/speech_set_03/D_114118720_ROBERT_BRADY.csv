1140027797,Mr. Speaker. on Tuesday. May 12. we had a horrific train derailment crash in the city of Philadelphia. So first off. our thoughts and prayers are with the eight men and women who lost their lives and the over 200 who were injured. I have never been more proud of the men and women who live and work in the city of Philadelphia. the city of brotherly love and sisterly affection. We had this major catastrophe at 9:15 at night. Within 4 minutes. our first respondersour police. our fire. Police Commissioner Ramsey. Fire Commissioner Sawyerwere on the scene. The scene was in total darkness. and we had volunteers from the neighborhood who even joined in. Imagine. total darkness. The only light was flashlights flashing back and forth. I stand here as proud as I could be of the mayor of the city of Philadelphia. Michael Nutter. who. from Tuesday until Sunday. was on that scene constantly. orchestrating the administration people. moving them around. consoling families. making sure that all were accounted for. and even making sure that their belongings were given back to them. I cant be more proud of our hospitals and our universities. Universities opened their doors for loved ones to come. And our hospitals. the doctors. nurses. all the men and women who worked therethere were doctors who worked 30 hours and went back home and couldnt sleep and came back to work another 12 hours. But most importantly. two things really struck me. Temple University Hospital in the city of Philadelphia had a lot of the injured people admitted to their hospital. The students who go to Temple University heard about it. One person said: I am sorry I am in your home. I am full of soot. and I am dirtying your rug and your couch. And in response. the lady said: That is okay. We can buy more couches. and we can buy more things. more whatever we need to buy. But you cant buy your health back. So we want to be here to be able to help you in the best way we can. I am honored to be standing here with my colleagues from Pennsylvania and some others from throughout the country. Some lost a loved one. I am extremely proud to recognize Chairman JEFF DENHAM and Ranking Member MIKE CAPUANO. who assisted me and toured the site with me. I appreciate their concern. and I appreciate them being there. So Mr. Speaker. the best way we can honor these men and women is to make sure this accident never again happens in the United States of America. With that. I ask for a moment of silence.

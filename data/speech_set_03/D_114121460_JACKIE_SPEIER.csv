1140025270,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their accepting amendments to address military sexual assault. increase oversight. transgender rights. whistleblower protection. and equal access to contraception for military women. but. despite these improvements and many others from my colleagues. I cannot support this bill in its current form. Instead of making tough decisions with our limited resources. this bill uses an accounting gimmick to further parochial and political interests above the readiness of the men and women protecting us and the interests of taxpayers we represent. We chose to address the sage grouse rather than the elephant in the room. By irresponsibly sheltering $38 billionabove the selfimposed budget gapin the OCO account. this bill attempts to decouple national security from economic security. In reality. these are one and the same. Our military leadership gets it. but this seems to be lost on us. Admiral Mullen. former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. stated that the deficit that we are unwisely adding to in this bill is the single greatest threat to our national security. Rather than empowering our military to align our force structure with the capabilities we need. we tied their hands. and. rather than addressing wasteful overhead. needless spare parts. or outdated weapon systems. we chose to ensure that corporations that move their headquarters overseas to avoid taxes continue to get Defense contracts. Provisions of this bill also attempt to force the DOD to keep our detention facility in Guantanamo Bay open. GTMO is a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies. Those arent my words. they are George W. Bushs and 15 to 20 retired generals and admirals. Another provision of this bill prevents the military from saving lives by purchasing alternative fuels. Costly refueling operations and convoys are extraordinarily dangerous. yet. because the existence of climate change is a political talking point. somehow. servicemember safety is second rate. The military is not separate from the rest of the country. Along with defending us. members of the military need to drive on roads that are not crumbling. cross bridges that are not falling. and send their children to public universities that are not bankrupt. It also makes it difficult to fund basic research. which has been a key element to our global competitive advantage and the source of much of the technology that our military relies on. We are choosing to spend vast quantities of money on planes that the military does not want. while refusing to address problems that everyone in the Nation. including military members. needs fixed. We have to face the reality that we cant keep our Nation secure if we let our country rot from the inside. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
1140033681,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Alzheimers disease is a threat to our countrynot a direct threat like ISIS or al Qaeda. but it is an insidious. persistent threat to the minds and bodies of our family members and to the fiscal health of our country. The Alzheimers Association estimates that the cost of caring for people with Alzheimers right now through the Medicare system is $226 billion. By the year 2050. it will be $1.1 trillion. This is a genuine budgetary threat. If it grows unchecked. the cost to Medicare from a single disease will zap our ability to pay for national security. Interestingly enough and timely enough. on the front page of USA Today is a story that reads how 15 percent of seniors account for nearly onehalf of Medicare spending. We also have an epidemic among our soldiers. It is called traumatic brain injury. known as the signature wound of veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq. It affects our soldiers at a much higher rate than the civilian population. and the VA projects its 10year costs at $2.2 billion. TBI is also closely linked to Alzheimers. For 30 years. we have known about a clear correlation between TBI and the risk of developing Alzheimers disease and other types of dementia. By researching the link between TBI and Alzheimers. we can help cure both. I applaud the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on Appropriations for increasing the funding for the Peer Reviewed Alzheimers Research Program from $12 million to its presequestration levels of $15 million. but the funding for Alzheimers research in the United States is still underresourced. Today. I am offering this amendment to increase the funding for the Peer Reviewed Program by $5 million. which would take it up to $20 million. This modest investment on the front end in research can eventually yield billions in savings in the future on the cost of care. That is why I urge my colleagues to support our servicemembers with TBI and Alzheimers and vote ""yes"" on this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California ."
1140048581,"Mr. Speaker. like slumber parties and sleepovers. a pillow fight doesnt sound like the type of activity that would leave 30 of our Nations most promising future military leaders injured or call into question the management practices of the Armys top academy. Yet. that is exactly what happened. We just learned that. on August 20. West Point freshman cadets got together for an annual pillow fight. and according to press accounts. they swung pillowcases packed with large. hard objects. thought to be helmets. This fight badly injured 30 cadets. 24 of them diagnosed with concussions. There were shoulders dislocated. one cadet diagnosed with a hairline fracture of the cheekbone. some with broken noses and split lips. Before the fight. upperclassmen commanders reportedly encouraged the freshmen by telling them. ""If you dont come back with a bloody nose. you didnt try hard enough."" The American people deserve to know what happened here. West Point and the Army have provided conflicting explanations. saying in one instance. ""Many members of the plebe class spontaneously participated in a pillow fight."" while. in another. they suggested that a pillow fight is a hallowed annual tradition. dating back to 1897. Well. which is it? West Point. apparently. doesnt know how to run this pillow fight either. This rite of passage has a track record of similar injuries. followed by ineffective attempts to make this event safer. Two years ago. for example. the 2013 pillow fight was canceled after at least one cadet placed a lockbox as a weapon in a pillowcase. Now it is back. and according to reports. the helmets the cadets were using to give their teammates concussions had been mandated as protection after injuries in previous pillow fights. May I remind everyone that this education is being paid for directly by the taxpayers of this country. The U.S. Government funds everything the Academy does to the tune of millions of dollars a year. It is utterly irresponsible to think that a violent pillow fight is a way to build camaraderie and create a professional military. West Point has stated that all cadets are back on duty and that it is pursuing an investigation. but Congress needs to know what kind of investigation it is pursuing and when we will receive answers. As the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committees Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. I am calling on the Army and the U.S. Military Academy to provide a clear explanation of the incident and its causes. as well as a full accounting of who was responsible and what measures are being taken to prevent something like this from happening again. We will not create the worlds most feared fighting force by hosting a concussionfilled slumber party. We must ensure that the august institution lives up to the exceptionally high standards that it represents and that our future military leaders live up to the great responsibility that rests on their shoulders. We can and we must do better."
1140055236,"Mr. Speaker. I am sick to my stomach this morning because we have just witnessed the 45th school shooting this year. There have been more than 294 mass shootings this year. and we have only had 272 days this year. I am not going to stand for another moment of silence on this floor unless it is joined with meaningful action. It is a hollow gesture to act like we care for these families when the truth is we dont care enough to act. Twentysix times since Sandy Hook we have paused on this floor. we have paused to give our prayers and our sympathy to the families who have lost loved ones. But what are we doing for the next set of families that are going to lose loved ones? We are going to do nothing. absolutely nothing. In fact. we create more credibility in the fictionalized ""death panels"" than we do about the actual deaths of innocent schoolchildren. college students. and moviegoers. This is the truth: In America. more preschoolers are shot dead each year than police officers killed in the line of duty. Ninetytwo Americans are shot to death each and every day. Ninetytwo will be shot to death today. Do we care enough to do anything? If there were that many people dying each day due to terrorism. disease. faulty consumer products. you bet we would do something. but not when it comes to guns. When it comes to guns. we can only muster enough to stand up on this floor and be silent. What a tragedy. Our inaction means we are willing to let thousands of our fellow citizens die so we can prop up the myth that gun violence measures. which the Supreme Court has ruled ironclad under the Constitution. will somehow undermine the Second Amendment. By refusing to adopt the mental health and background check measures supported by 90 percent of the population and 74 percent of NRA members. we are doing the bidding of the NRA lobbyists and the gun manufacturers. We are not standing side by side with the victims of Umpqua and Charleston and Sandy Hook. We are shrugging and saying. ""Eh. stuff happens."" Stuff does not just happen. As you can see on this chart. gun violence is dramatically down in States that have passed strong gun violence prevention laws. You can see the trends in other industrialized countries that have reacted wisely to gun violence. Australia had 13 mass shootings over 18 years. But then they put in strong laws to protect against gun violence. and they havent had one mass shooting since then. In Canada and Norway. also. they tightened their gun laws in the wake of mass shootings. and gun violence rates are a fraction today of what they were. These countries are our closest allies. They are not Fascist regimes. If they can do it. we can do it. We need to make mental health reporting laws universal and enforce the ones already on the books. It is shameful that eight States have no mental health reporting laws and 13 States have submitted fewer than 100 mental health records each to the national background check system. By the way. Senate Majority Whip JOHN CORNYN says that his measure is the solution. He has even introduced his own bill. but he and his Caucus have declined to advance it. We have to make background checks universal by closing the gun show loophole and the loophole for online sales. These loopholes allow criminals. drug abusers. and mentally ill people who are already banned from having guns to get guns. Finally. we need to lift the ban on NIH and CDC research. Mr. Speaker. I will not stand for another one of these hypocritical moments of silence. but I will stand up for any effort we make to pass sensible and genuine gun safety laws. Lipservice alone is a disservice to these families and the next families who dont want our prayers. but want the lives of their loved ones back."
1140072416,"Mr. Speaker. some universities protect predatory professors with slaps on the wrist and secrecy. just like the Catholic Church sheltered childmolesting priests for many decades. The incidents described in this report are lurid and disturbing. One graduate student was told regularly by Dr. Slater that she would teach better if she did not wear underwear. He asked another graduate student to give women pointers on oral sex techniques. Dr. Slater himself admitted that he gave an employee a vegetableshaped vibrator and that he frequently commented to his employees and students about the appearance of women. My staff spoke with one female grad student who was required to attend a strip club in order to discuss her academic work with Dr. Slater. The woman has since left the field of astronomy. The second female grad student told us that. during a oneonone work meeting with Dr. Slater. he told her that all of the other graduate students had had sex at his house. that he had video cameras. and asked when she would join him to have sex there. She transferred out of Dr. Slaters lab. losing years of work. This is a significant reason as to why women hold fewer than onethird of the faculty positions in science and engineering. Dr. Slater has said he is now reformed. which may be the case. but his actions. however lurid. are just symptoms of a larger problem of how to effectively deal with sexual harassment in academia. I agree with Dr. Meg Urry. the president of the American Astronomical Society. who said: ""In my view. this is what it would take to move the needle: severe and visible consequences for violating policies on harassmentand they do have to be visible."" That is why I plan to introduce legislation to require universities to inform other universities of the final results of a disciplinary proceeding. When students. faculty. or staff whose conduct has violated title IX transfer to another institution. the universities to which they are moving should be aware of their past conduct. I encourage anyone who has experienced sexual harassment in science. whether it is related to this incident or another. to call my office. Students enter astronomy to study the stars. not their professors sex lives. It is time to stop pretending sexual harassment in science happened a long time ago in a galaxy far. far away."
1140080089,"I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for bringing us together tonight to talk about one of the most fundamental issues facing women in this country. I would hope that we would do these Special Orders on a monthly basis or maybe even more frequently to kind of beat the drum about how important it is for us to address this issue. Today we see everything we need to see to convince us of the need to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and put womens equality into the Constitution. We have a pay gap that has not closed where women are making 79 cents for every dollar that men make. For African American women that is 63 cents. and for Latina women it is 54 cents for every dollar earned by a man. In fact. women in this country have to work until April 15 of the following yeartax day. ironicallyto make as much money as their male counterparts. We cant afford that. We cant afford that in a country that speaks of equality. Meanwhile. we have a Congress and State legislators who are focused like a laser beam on attacking womens health. We just spent 5 hours today in a hearing of a special committee designed specifically to attack womens health. Since the start of 2016merely 2 months ago. and for the last 2 monthsthere have been more than 201 antichoice bills introduced in State legislatures across this country. efforts to undermine a womans right to choose. We have a Supreme Court seat at stake and issues of gender equality hanging in the balance. It is important to quote what the late Justice Scalia said about discrimination against women. He was a constitutional expert. an originalist. and he said the following: ""Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesnt."" When I read that quotation by Justice Scaliamay he rest in peaceI had shivers up and down my spine because it was so direct. It was so clear. It makes the point that the Constitution of this country does not prohibit discrimination based on sex. even though the vast majority of Americans believe it is already in the Constitution. Ninetysix percent of U.S. adults believe that male and female citizens should have equal rights. and 72 percent mistakenly believe it is already in the Constitution. As Justice Scalia pointed out. it is not. So what does that mean? That means that every single woman in this country can be subject to discrimination and not have a legal foot to stand on. Probably one of the most obvious cases is the case of Peggy Young. Peggy Young worked for United Parcel Service for 10 years. She was a good worker. a hard worker. And then. lo and behold. she gets pregnant. She gets pregnant. She goes to her supervisor and she says: I am pregnant. He says: Okay. Go to your doctor and find out what accommodations you will require. She went to her doctor. and her doctor said: Well. you can do anything except you cant lift more than 10 pounds. So she came back to her supervisor and said: I can do anything except I cant lift more than 10 pounds. He said: Oh. my gosh. that is a terrible liability. For all intents and purposes. she was fired from her job. She was told she will have to take a leave of absence. that she will not be paid. and that she would not be eligible for health benefits. So her entire pregnancy she had no prenatal care and no health insurance. Now. what makes this story particularly insidious is that during that same timeframe. men at the United Parcel Service who had heart disease. heart attacks. had had a DUI. or had diabetes were asked to go to their doctors and find out what accommodations they should propose. Some of them came back with the exact same accommodation: that they could not lift more than 10 pounds. What did United Parcel Service do? United Parcel Service accommodated them. That is profound discrimination. But guess what. Peggy Young filed a lawsuit. It went all the way to the Supreme Court. and it got remanded. It got remanded in part because not only did she have to prove that there was discrimination. which clearly there was. she had to prove that it was intentional discrimination by United Parcel Service. and she couldnt prove that. Now. in all the other forms of discrimination. whether it is based on race or religion. you only have to prove that there was discrimination. not that there was intentional acts of discrimination. So that is why it is so important that we get this in the Constitution. We have a new generation of women who are more independent. more able to support themselves. and more politically empowered than ever. I just read an article that shows single women are now our most potent political force in this country. Single womenwhether they are single never been married. single divorced. single separated. singleare our most potent electoral force. They deserve the right to full legal equality under our Constitution. How can this body. of all bodies. not recognize the importance of equality among men and women? So I have introduced H.J. Res. 51. It is very simple. The ERA was introduced first in 1923 by Alice Paul. and introduced every Congress since then. and then it was introduced and actually passed the House and passed the Senate. It then had to be ratified by threequarters of the States. Unfortunately. when that was drafted. in the preamble they put a timeline. It was ratified by 35 States. but not 38. So it came back to Congress. and they amended the preamble and extended the length of time in which the ERA could be passed by other States. And then nothing happened. What this resolution doesand it would only require a majority of the Members of this body to pass itis basically use the precedent and take the preamble and the time deadline and just strike it. There is no need for a deadline in a constitutional amendment. Most constitutional amendments have not been subject to a deadline. There is precedent that they were willing to change it as it relates to the ERA. and I say lets make it yet another precedent and just take the timeline out of it. That would give us the opportunity to get three more States to pass the ERA. to ratify it. We already know in Virginia it has been passed by the senate. and we are waiting for action in the house. As my good friend from Florida said. in Florida they could pass it. conceivably. now. So why not do what is fundamentally right? Why not do what is so simple? Twentyfour simple words. that is all the ERA is. It is on one page. and it is simply: ""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" The time has come. Members. and I applaud my good colleague from New Jersey for bringing us together. We should do it again. I enjoy working with you on any number of issues."
1140086332,Madam Speaker. since 1970. more Americans have died from domestic gun violence than in every war dating back to the American Revolution. If all the victims of gun violence since 1970 were put on a wall like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. it would contain 1.5 million names and stretch 21/2 miles. That is 25 times as long as the actual Vietnam Veterans Memorial. We are quick to hold moments of silence on this floor. but we are not quick to act. I have had enough of Congress failure to lead. So to draw attention to the slaughter going on in this country each and every month. I will recite the names each month of every person killed in a mass shooting during the previous month. I have also created my own memorial wall in the hallway outside of my office. Here are the stories of some of the victims of the 31 mass shootings in March of this year. There have been so many people this month affected by mass shootings. that I dont have time to list the injured. but I recognize the trauma they have endured as well. Deonte Fisher. age 7. was killed sitting in a parked car outside a convenience store on March 4 in Columbus. Ohio. Anthony Renee Beamon. Jr.. age 36. was killed while leaving a party on March 6 in Compton. California. Pablo Villeda Estrada. age 19. was killed at a birthday party on March 6 in Chelsea. Massachusetts. He loved music and was a family jokester. Austin Harter. age 29. Clint Harter. age 27. Jake Waters. age 36. and Michael Capps. age 41. were killed by their neighbor on March 7 in Kansas City. Kansas. The shooter also killed Randy J. Nordman. age 49. the next day while fleeing police. Ishmael Haywood. age 20. and Demontray Keshawn Mackay. age 17. were killed in a car on March 8 in San Antonio. Texas. Jerry Shelton. age 35. Tina Shelton. age 37. Brittany Powell. age 27. Chanetta Powell. age 25. and Shada Mahone. age 26. were killed at a family cookout on March 9 in Wilkinsburg. Pennsylvania. Chanetta was 8 months pregnant. John Smith. age 65. and Jamil Goodwin. age 43. were killed while sitting on their porch on March 11 in Detroit. Michigan. Douglas Hearne. age 48. was killed at a bar on March 12 in Wichita Falls. Texas. Alyric Fouch. age 17. was killed by her mothers boyfriend on March 12 in Elberton. Georgia. She was trying to protect her mother from gunfire. Deosha Jackson. age 19. and Daryl Hunt. age unknown. were killed on March 19 in Wetumpka. Alabama. Serge Pierre Dumas. age 28. was killed at a house party on March 20 in Plantation. Florida. He is survived by his 15monthold son pictured here on this poster next to me. Billie Jo Hettinger. age 32. and her children Collin Hettinger. age 5. and Courtney Hettinger. age 4. were killed by their husband and father on March 20 in Louisville. Kentucky. Kelly Russler. age 39. and her sons Jayden Evans. age 10. and Laing Russler. age 7. were killed by Kellys husband and Laings father on March 21 in Sherman. Texas. Elizabeth Janie Woods. age unknown. was killed by her husband on March 25 in Lauderdale County. Alabama. He also shot their two sons. who were in critical condition but have survived. Virginia State Trooper Chad P. Dermyer was killed by a gunman at a bus station on March 31 in Richmond. Virginia. He was a Marine Corps veteran and had two young children. May the dead rest in peace. the wounded recover quickly and completely. and the bereaved find comfort. Members. colleagues. mothers and fathers. when will we do more than call for moments of silence?
1140098921,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for giving me the opportunity to speak today about LGBT Pride Month. Pride Month is coming at a crucial time this year. While we have made huge strides in the LGBT community over the last few yearsfrom marriage equality to the introduction of the Equality Actthis year has been a tragic and frustrating reminder of the terrain ahead. Congress has ground to a halt. from legislative appropriations to the National Defense Authorization Act. as too many conservatives remain obsessed with legalizing discrimination from the contracting system to our own bathrooms. They just cant help themselves. We cant do our job right now. and soon we will be leaving for election season without finishing the appropriations process all because conservatives are obsessed with making discrimination legal. Thats right. They want to make discrimination legal. Who are they trying to serve? The American people and corporate America are not standing for this bigoted behavior. Corporations around the country are canceling conventions in States that have passed legislation that prevents transgender bathrooms from being available. At the entryway to my congressional office stands a California flag bearing the rainbow stripes of the LGBT movement. It is a mark of how far we have come that such a flag is now commonplace on Capitol Hill. but on this Pride Month. conservatives are debating how best to overturn antidiscrimination provisions and bar their own constituents from using the restroom. This is absolutely ridiculous. and. frankly. a tragic nadir in congressional action. I am sick and tired of my colleagues saying they oppose discrimination. that they are fighting for LGBT Americans. and that they support equality when time and again they have voted just the opposite way. How about instead of bickering about bathrooms. we look at passing true antidiscrimination laws? Right now we dont have laws preventing housing. credit. workplace. or healthcare discrimination. We have lifted the ban on LGBT military service. but our transgender servicemembers continue to serve in the shadows. never knowing if this will be the day they are dismissed. Now is the time to ban socalled gay conversion therapy that harms so many of our children. Californians. and especially my beloved San Franciscans. have always been at the forefront of this fight for equality. As San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk said when he became one of the first openly gay elected officials. gay children who werent accepted by their parents and peers used to feel they had few options: ""staying in the closet. suicide. And then one day that child might open a paper that says. Homosexual elected in San Francisco. "" That is what Harvey did many decades ago. One option is to go to California. he said. and the other is to stay and fight. That is the fighting spirit we need to keep alive today as we work to make sure our laws live up to the promise of the Declaration of Independence. that all of us. each and every one of us. is created equal and that we should be treated that way. So I thank my colleague again for giving us the opportunity to have this Special Order to talk about Pride Month and the importance of not just being proud that there is a Pride Month. but redoubling our efforts to make sure that these really insidious amendments are not slipped into bills to enforce discrimination. Because that is what they do. They legalize discrimination. We dont stand for that. That is not what this body is about. and that is not what this country is about."
1140111583,Mr. Speaker. the minority has for many months now begged and pleaded to have a bill come to this floor for a vote on gun violence prevention. We have even had a sitin. But all that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to do is have moments of silence and then be silent. The only moments of silence are for those names that are in the headlines. That is not good enough. All of the deaths matter. and all of the deaths from mass shootings in the month of July deserve to be recognized by all of us. So as I have done each month since the beginning of this year. I will now read the names of all those who were killed in mass shootings in the month of July: Alex Freeman. 28. and Marcus Cal. also 28. were killed on July 4 in Chattanooga. Armando Cardona. 45. and Naome Innis. 35. were killed on July 4 in Phoenix. Charles Jackson. 28. Jamal Dataunte DixonLackey. 26. and Daquarius Tucker. 19. were killed at a Fourth of July block party in Houston. Texas. Daquarius brother was also shot and killed this summer. Police said both brothers were innocent bystanders. Demetrius Grant. 39. was killed at a party on July 5 in LA. Jeffrey Adams. 52. was killed by his neighbor on July 5 in Hiram. Georgia. Jennifer Rooney. 44. was killed by a mass shooter while driving on July 7 in Bristol. Tennessee. Five Dallas police officersBrent Thompson. Patrick Zamarripa. Michael Krol. Michael Smith. and Lorne Ahernswere killed in the line of duty on July 7 in Dallas. Texas. Domingo Rodriguez Rhines. 40. was killed in Shreveport. Louisiana. Joseph Zangaro. 61. and Ron Kienzle. 60. both court bailiffs. were killed by an escaping suspect on July 11 in St. Joseph. Michigan. Jacara Sproaps. 38. and Maurice Partlow. 40. were killed by Jacaras exboyfriend on July 13 in St. Louis. Missouri. Jacara was an elementary school principal beloved by the community. Eric Gaiter. 22. was killed July 14 in Akron. Ohio. while at a vigil for another gun violence victim. Three unidentified people were killed at a home in Crosby. Texas. Joseph Lamar. 38. Janell Renee Knight. 43. and Zachary David Thompson. 36. were killed by their friend on July 15 in Woodland. Washington. Miguel Bravo. 21. was killed when gunmen openfired on the house party next door on July 16 in Bakersfield. California. Three police officers. Montrell Jackson. 32. Matthew Gerald. 41. and Brad Garafola. 45. were killed in the line of duty on July 17 in Baton Rouge. Louisiana. Edward James Long. 49. was killed on July 17 in Houston. Texas. while standing outside a Walgreens. Bobbie Odneal. III. 23. and Rickey McGowan. 25. were killed on July 23 at a nightclub in Cincinnati. Ohio.

Ohio. Sean Archilles. 14. and StefAn Strawder. 18. were killed outside an under18 club on July 25 in Fort Myers. Florida. Denzel Childs. 25. and Kayana Armond. 34. were killed on July 28 at a block party in Chicago. Illinois. Jessica Williams. 16. witnessed the shooting and suffered an asthma attack that killed her. Davon Harper. 23. was killed on July 28 in Baltimore. Maryland. Anna Bui. Jake Long. and Jordan Ebner. all 19. were killed on July 30 in Washington when Annas exboyfriend showed up at the house party with an AR15. Carole Comer. 71. her son. John Comer. 50. and her daughter. Rebecca Kelleher. 45. were killed by their husband and father on July 30 in Bridgeton. Missouri. Takeeya Fulton. 39. and her children. Nuckeria and Corey. were killed by Takeeyas boyfriend on July 31 in MiamiDade County. Florida. A few words about my constituent. Teqnika Moultrie. 30. who was killed on July 31 in Austin. Texas. She was from San Carlos and worked as a school bus driver for Sequoia Union High School District. She was visiting with her wifes family in Austin when a gunman opened fire as she exited a doughnut shop. She died in her wifes arms. They had only been married for 3 months. After her death. her wife said: We just wanted to live a normal life. an everyday life and raise a family. be good moms and do it together. Now we dont get to do anything. So many of these people killed at parties. on the sidewalks. and in their homes by people who were supposed to love them dont get to do any of that. Mr. Speaker. deaths matter. All deaths matter.

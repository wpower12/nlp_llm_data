1140036287,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. today. I rise in opposition to the rule which. once again. deprives Members of this body the opportunity to debate amendments that will improve the underlying legislation. I rise in opposition to this bodys misguided priorities. Again. the American people are seeing Congress rehash the same tired debates. How many references were there to people that were Speakers of this House. that were Senate majority leaders. to healthcare reform. which has already withstood several elections and is the law of the land? What we have before us today are two more bills that repeal part of the Affordable Care Act. We have now considered over 60 bills to repeal. defund. or dismantle the Affordable Care Act. rather than improve and build upon it. With all the work that remains to be done. we could be debating legislation to renew our expiring highway trust fund and repair our crumbling roads and bridges. We could take up legislation to renew the charter of the ImportExport Bank. and we will be offering that soon on the previous question. We could consider a bill to repair our broken immigration system or help the millions of Americans who are living below the poverty line. even though they work two jobs and it is increasingly hard to support their families. or we could take on the critical matter of climate change and confront the fact that it has contributed to one of the worst droughts in our Nations history. But. oh. no. it is more important to have the 61st and 62nd repeal of parts of the Affordable Care Act. rather than move forward with a futureoriented agenda for the American people. Now. lets get into some of the specifics of the underlying legislation. The most recent estimate by the Congressional Budget Office found that a total of 27 million people will gain access to healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 years. who otherwise would not have had coverage. That is to say nothing of the additional millions of Americans who benefit from the Affordable Care Act by having coverage for preexisting conditions for the first time in their lives. are no longer subject to lifetime caps that could leave them bankrupt if they get a serious illness. or people that are able to stay as young adults up to age 26 on their parents plan. Constituents from all areas of my district have shared stories of their success using our States health exchange. Connect for Health Colorado. and described how the Affordable Care Acts coverage provided by the ACA has improved their lives. I have heard from constituents like Morgan. from Nederland. Colorado. who used the exchange to enroll in the exact same plan she had before the Affordable Care Act. but her premiums decreased. and the services that were covered expandedmore value for her money. Or Donna. who recently moved to Boulder. ColoradoDonna is an outdoor enthusiast. like so many in my district. but was afraid to make her way to the mountains until she had secured healthcare coverage. Through Connect for Health Colorado and the premium tax credits she has access to under the Affordable Care Act. she is now enrolled in a comprehensive medical and dental plan that ensures she wont become bankrupt if she sustains an injury. These are far from isolated cases. In my home State of Colorado. 16.5 percent of people lacked health insurance before ACA. According to a recent study of the Kaiser Family Foundation. that figure has dropped to 9 percent by last year. The success is not limited to my State. According to a Gallup poll released in April. the percentage of Americans lacking health care nationwide has dropped by more than a third since the marketplace opened at the end of 2013. from 18 percent to under 12 percent. The Affordable Care Act is working. instead of continuing in that vein. once again. the Republican Congress is seeking to repeal various parts of that law. rather than move forward and improve it. The first of todays two bills. the socalled Protecting Seniors Access to Medicare Act. doesnt protect anyones access to anything. The Advisory Board it seeks to repeal. which has been vilified and completely mischaracterized in the past. is actually something far more mundane and important to the processes of Medicare. It is a board of advisers who make nonbinding recommendations to Congress about how we can reduce healthcare costs and strengthen Medicare solvency over the long term. without sacrificing the quality of care. something that all of us. as costconscious Members of Congress. should be interested in seeing. Now. we can debate all day the exact composition of the Board or which committees in Congress should have jurisdiction over its recommendations. Those are valid considerationsor. instead. we can discuss repealing the Board in its entirety. which is what we are talking about here today. This Advisory Board will provide critical advice to help Congress reduce the cost of providing health care. Now. interestingly enough. this amendment pays for the $7 billion cost of eliminating this Board by slashing nearly $9 billion in funding from the prevention and public health fund. This fund is used for vital preventative health programs. like childhood vaccines. helping people quit smoking. stroke prevention. and maternal wellness. The cornerstone of health savings is preventative medicine. In fact. I cosponsor a bill with my friend. Mr. BURGESS. who is managing the bill on the other side. that would allow the Congressional Budget Office to account for the longterm savings of preventative health initiatives when it scores legislation. If Mr. BURGESS own bill were to become law. and I hope it does. it would show that the socalled way that we are paying for this repeal is illusory. Eliminating the preventative healthcare program actually can cost money in the long run. Under the congressional scoring model that we both support. it would likely not even register as a cost saving. or if it did. it would be much less than the $9 billion. The second bill being considered. the Protect Medical Innovation Act. aims to do something that many of us on both sides support. repealing the Affordable Care Acts excise tax on medical devices. The medical device tax is one of the measures originally included by the Senate in the Affordable Care Act to fund the badly needed consumer protections and benefits that form the core of the bill. Now. again. it is easy to support tax cuts. This body has put before us many. tax cut after tax cut after tax cut that are unfunded. The whole discussion about how you can afford to cut taxes is how you pay for it. What government waste do you cut? What other taxes or income do you use to offset the cost of these tax cuts? Of course. we dont want to slow the pace of progress with unnecessary costs and burdens. and we want to make sure that medical device manufacturers have every incentive to increase their research and development and not pass these costs along to consumers. Unfortunately. even though I. along with ALMA ADAMS from North Carolina and MATT CARTWRIGHT from Pennsylvania. offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that would have paid for repealing the medical device tax using a commonsense approach that wouldnt suppress economic growth. our amendment was not allowed to even be discussed here on the floor of the House. Not only would our amendment to pay for the medical device repeal have avoided adding nearly $30 billion to our deficit. as this bill would do before us today. but it also would have helped bring balance to our Nations energy sector by stopping the government from choosing winners and losers in energy and lessen our dependence on fossil fuels. Unfortunately. under this rule. we dont get a vote or debate on the floor. We are left with two bad choices. We can. of course. leave in place a tax that many of us want to remove. or we can add $25 billion to our deficit. Neither of those are the right answers for the American people or for medical device companies or the consumers who use medical device products. The American people deserve better. If we defeat this rule. an open process will allow Republicans and Democrats to offer real. constructive. better ideas of how to improve upon these two pieces of legislation. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140040032,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Instead of engaging in partisan fights on so important an issue that. in essence. is about our future as a Nation and future generations. we should find common ground. Education is a civil right. All students deserve the opportunity of a world class. highquality education. This very week. the Senate is discussing their own version of ESEA reauthorization. Now. while nothing is perfect. their bill reflects the bipartisan spirit that would improve this bill if it was allowed in this body. Members of the TriCaucus and leaders of the New Democrat Coalition have sent letters to the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health. Employment. Labor. and Pensions with a number of suggestions for their bill. but at least there is a bipartisan attempt to help prepare our Nations kids for our future. ESEA is one of the most significant pieces of legislation this body will consider. It is a bill about our future. Members of this body are eager to improve this bill and pass a reauthorized version to finally replace No Child Left Behind. No child should have to attend a failing school. and ZIP Code and race should never determine the quality of an education that a child receives. I think that is something. hopefully. we can agree on as a core principle. Unfortunately. the bill before us retreats from our promise to our Nations students. H.R. 5 would bring us back to a time with no accountability standards. where students with disabilities are swept under the rug. It would divert money from the schools and kids that need it the most. and with the Salmon amendment. it would sweep minority students. students with disabilities. new immigrant students. and lowincome students under the rug. as they were in the past. Now that they have emerged. we must ensure that they meet all the learning needs for all students. Mr. Speaker. we are shortchanging our Nations kids by not being thoughtful and deliberate with this issue. It is rare that a bill would unite the business community. teachers. school boards. and many others in opposition. but H.R. 5 does this. The bills sponsors had 133 days to give students and our country a bill that they deserve. It is a shame that they didnt take better advantage of that opportunity. I encourage my colleagues to vote ""no"" on the rule. ""no"" on the bill. ""no"" on the Salmon amendment. and ""yes"" on the Democratic substitute. which was thoughtfully put together to ensure that Americas next generation is prepared to carry on our legacy of global leadership and to put food on their tables as aspiring members of our great country. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140044581,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. The best way to address the problems in our immigration system. the best way to address the lack of security for American citizens. the best way to ensure that there are not others like Kathryn Steinle and others that have fallen victim to immigrant felons is to fix our broken immigration system. secure our borders. Only Congress can do that. Now. the President has taken the first steps to help keep Americans safe by suggesting certain policies like DACA and DAPA programs. Now. DACA is being implemented. DAPA is. unfortunately. tied up in the courts. What these efforts allow our law enforcement agencies to do is to focus their efforts on criminals like Mr. LopezSanchez rather than violators of our civil law. It would be better if this body could put those concepts into statute or. better yet. make sure that we can differentiate between noncriminals and criminals within the law. An immigration reform bill would reduce the risk of tragedies like this and help keep Americans safe by helping law enforcement identify people who are here illegally. and it would bring people out of the shadows. Identifying the portion of our people that are here illegally that qualify for relief and for prosecutorial discretion would help our law enforcement agencies narrow their focus and targets to individuals like Mr. LopezSanchez. Immigration reform efforts like H.R. 15. which was the comprehensive bill from last Congress. would modernize our immigration agencies. increase enforcement and resources tools. technology. and border security to prevent tragedies like this from occurring. Doing the difficult work of having a meaningful debate around immigration reform is the only way we can ever be able to keep Americans safer and reduce the likelihood of this kind of incident. A vote for this particular bill wont do anything to address these systemic problems. Had this been the law. it would not have prevented this tragedy. nor does it do anything to address the problems plaguing our immigration system. Instead. it threatens and bullies local law enforcement and says to them. either expose yourself to civil liabilitywhich is very real. My agencies in Colorado have been forced to paythey have been forced to pay$30.000 or $40.000. So pay legal fines. or we are going to cut your grants. Look. it is a natural tendency of people to pass the buck. and Congress is basically trying to pass the buck to local law enforcement for our failures here in this body. Mr. LopezSanchez should not have been wandering the streets of San Francisco or any other American city. He should not have been allowed to illegally enter. In fact. he had been caught at the border four or five times. and he had snuck across other times. We need real border security. and we need to finally enforce our law and get serious about restoring the rule of law. which this bill would only make an even bigger joke. Rather than restoring the rule of law and encouraging cooperation between Federal. State. and local authorities in cases that involve immigrant felons. this bill would punish local law enforcement for prioritizing public safety and community policing over trying to do the job that Congress and the Federal Government are supposed to do. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140046549,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills. H.R. 3236. the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act. and H.R. 1994. the VA Accountability Act. Yet again. we have a grab bag rule that covers multiple bills on wildly different subjectsin this case. transportation and veterans carein one bill. and yet we have a closed rule that is pushing through a lastminute deal that kicks the can down the road yet again on highway reauthorization when there is reason to believe that. if we simply stayed in town and worked another week. we might be able to work with the Senate to get to an end point with regard to a longterm reauthorization. The closed rule here limits the discussion of alternatives on the issue of transportation funding. Even worse. the bill has two entirely unrelated aspects. I have never heard of a crazier name than the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act. This is part of the problem of this body over the last several years. Republican leadership has moved towards doing more and more omnibuses and minibuses. That means combining disparate billstransportation. veteransinto one bill. which isnt healthy for the accountability of this body among the electorate. If you vote against this bill. for instance. because you dont like the transportation provisions. does that mean you are against veterans? If you dont like the veterans provisions and you vote against this bill. does that mean you are against transportation? How easy it would be to simply have two votes on each of these bills so Members on both sides of the aisle can vote their conscience and our constituents can hold us accountable. Of course. it is necessary to give the VA the authority to transfer $3.3 billion for healthcare services. There is strong agreement on both sides. We could run the bill through on suspension. We wouldnt even need to open it up for a rule. It would pass with more than a twothirds vote. But there are problematic additions attached to that part of the bill. It is also combined with yet another temporary fix for our Nations highway system. instead of trying to stay in town another week and work on a more permanent fix to help meet the needs of the transportation arteries of our country. As you know. Mr. Speaker. 54 percent of our Nations major roads and bridges are rated poor or mediocre. Fortyfive percent of Americans dont have access to public transit. Congestion produced by our legislative failures here wastes valuable time and money and detracts from the growth of the American economy. It is estimated Americans will lose 8.4 billion hours and 4.45 billion gallons of gas over a decade. That means the average consumer is wasting $800 a year and 5 full days of their life away from their kids. away from their family. simply sitting in traffic. Mr. Speaker. that is unacceptable. My constituents are no strangers to traffic. If you have been to Fort Collins. one of the largest cities in my district and home to one of our great universities. you will find that on highway 25 my constituents endure gridlocked traffic at rush hour. doubling or tripling their commuting times. Expansion of highway 25 and highspeed rail along highway 70 and highway 36 have been given completion dates of decades from now60 years. in some cases. Try to imagine being told your doctor wants to slowly break down blockages in your arteries over a period of 60 years. You wont make it that far. Our communities need to do something about traffic now. Tourism and commerce are the lifeblood of Fort Collins. Boulder. and our mountain communities like Vail. Frisco. and Breckenridge. For these towns to survive and thrive. we need to tackle our transportation funding needs headon. From our other speakers. you will hear a lot about the ExportImport Bank. the one item that somehow. with this grab bag that includes veterans and transportation. there is a strong bipartisan majority for reauthorizing the ExportImport Bank. In fact. 67 Senators in the Republicanled Senate voted to reauthorize the ExportImport Bank. and yet somehow that item didnt make the grab bag. If Congress fails to act. one of the most important items is it will result concretely in the loss of tens of thousands of American jobs and make American companies less competitive for exports at a time when global competitiveness and the global economy is more important than ever. which was left out of this grab bag of bills. I understand ideological issues with the ExportImport Bank. In a perfect world. I would agree with my colleagues who argue we shouldnt need to do this kind of effective subsidy for exporters. but if other countries are doing it and it is permissible under WTO and trade rules. we would truly be idiots to unilaterally disarm and not engage in a legal practice that facilitates the credit of American exporting businesses. Effectively. it would lead to the exporting of more jobs overseas and making American companies less competitive in selling their products. So. by all means. lets have the discussion around multilateral adjustments to the type of credit facilities that countries can engage in with exporting countries. but lets not look at unilateral disarmament that makes America less competitive and destroys jobs. You will hear a lot about how simple it would be. my colleagues would indicate. to simply get this done before we leave. Isnt it worth another week of our time to save tens of thousands of American jobs? The second part of the rule. H.R. 1994. the VA Accountability Act. one of the main problems with it is it would create a culture of fear that would imperil the services our veterans need and deserve. The tragedy in the Phoenix VA system is an example. It became known because of a few courageous whistleblowers. Had this legislation been in place. this tragedy could have been swept under the rug for many more years. Without whistleblowers and strong whistleblower protections. the VA hospital debacle in my State of Colorado. in Aurora. could have even been a worse situation. if you can imagine that. This legislation is not just bad for whistleblowers. it is also unconstitutional. Supreme Court case law has clearly outlined the due process that employees have before their jobs are taken away. This bill turns its back on due process and allows any VA employee to be fired on the spot for retribution. The limited process provided in this legislation is far below the constitutional requirements. which is why the President has promised to veto this bill. All this bill is attempting to do is destroy the whistleblower and professional civil service system and. thus. the livelihood of thousands and the quality of service to our veterans. The appropriate action is to get the VA to do their job through appropriate legislation which creates true accountability. which this bill fails to achieve. or discuss how we might reform the dollars we allocate to the VA to best serve our veterans. however possible. We will debate an alternative today by my colleague. Mr. TAKANO of California. that would retain due process but allows the VA to immediately fire any employee who poses a health or safety risk to veterans. Additionally. it prevents employees from staying on paid administrative leaveeven being bounced around the VAby limiting the time to 2 weeks. a similarity to one of the positive aspects of the bill before us today.
1140050507,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time. Again. I think it is clear. We have had many Democrats coming to the floor talking about what we should be doing. I think the gentleman from Georgia might be the only Republican in the Chamber. Maybe there is one other in the back. I dont have my glasses on. We have a lot of ideas for keeping government open. Mainly. lets pass a continuing resolution to do it now. Lets work more than 6 days out of the next 14. Lets stay here until we can keep government open. until we can reauthorize the transportation and infrastructure bill. It sounds obvious to me. yet there just didnt seem to be any interest from the other side. No Republicans have approached me about keeping government open. I hope you do. Mr. Speaker. I hope you encourage your colleagues to. There is no one here in the Chamber talking about what we can do to avoid a jobcrushing government shutdown. which we are 14 days away from. Instead. we are talking about unrelated bills. Now. I dont deny that these bills deserve their day in the sun. I just question whether. when we are 6 legislative days from a jobcrushing shutdown. it is the time to discuss whether we should amend requirements set out by the National Environmental Policy Act. or NEPA. that would reduce the role of public input and turn the idea of NEPA on its head by eliminating any illusion of objective or scientific analysis by allowing private sponsors to write parts of their own environmental reviews. Now. look. we can discuss that. I am strongly for reforming the NEPA process. As an example. if we can make it easier to site renewal energy projects. I am a sponsor of a bill to expedite the NEPA process for solar and wind infrastructure projects. Look. there are people who support this terrible bill in its current form. I completely understand that. but this bill does nothing to avert a jobdestroying government shutdown that we are only 6 legislative days from reaching. Now. the gentleman from Georgia mentioned this. what we call a martial law amendment. With this amendment that he is proposing with this rulewe just got notice of it last minute here on the floorhe is offering an amendment that will allow any bill to be brought up under martial law next week. Now. in honor of Pope Francis visit. I hope that they have a bill that they plan to bring to the floor under martial law to reduce our carbon emissions and finally do something to impact climate change. which I hope that Pope Francis will be addressing. I also hope that. under martial law. they will bring forward a bill to replace our broken immigration system with a humane system. with a pathway to citizenship that replaces the chaos we have. with the rule of law. border security. and a pathway to normalization and citizenship for hardworking. aspiring Americans who are already here. Now. I am not going to bet the ship that that is what they are going to do with this martial law. but the fact of the matter is. from a process perspective. wemyself. my colleagues. and I think most of the Republican rank and filesimply dont know what they are going to do with that authority. This is going around the normal rules of the House to establish a mechanism to avoid the normal process. avoid the normal process through Rules Committee and. through martial law. bring some sort of bill. I hope it is an immigration reform bill. I hope it is a climate change bill. I dont think it is. Based on what we are seeing this week. it will probably be some NEPA bill or someI dont knowsome other bill that doesnt avoid a government shutdown to the floor of the House. Maybe it will be a bill that is a Republican funding bill that will have a Presidential veto threat over it. That doesnt avoid a shutdown. Remember. the only way we can avoid a shutdown is the House. the Senate. and the President of the United States are on the same page for legislation to avoid a government shutdown. Lets give them the benefit of the doubt. and we will be back next week. and I will hold my criticism. I hope it is an immigration reform bill. I hope it is a climate change bill. I hope we honor Pope Francis by bringing forward two of his top priorities in a week that is appropriate. and if that is the case. I will support martial law for those two efforts. and I hope that that is what we will do. I will withhold judgment until we see what the Republicans attempt to do with this procedural bypass of our normal mechanisms that they have scheduled for next week. Look. these are bad bills under this rule. They are bad bills today. They would be bad bills if they were appropriate to consider. I believe they are inappropriate to consider in light of a jobcrushing government shutdown occurring in 6 legislative days.
1140070975,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Over the holidays. like all Members of this body. I was back home and excited about coming back in January to legislate and move the country forward. I was hoping we could tackle some of the big issues of the day: balance a Federal budget. pass immigration reform and secure our borders. and. finally. deal with the contentious issue of what kind of authorization of military force we want to give to the Commander in Chief. These are all important issues I was thinking about and reading about and hoping we would deal with when we got back here. Instead. here we are. our first day back in session. And I point out that most Americans. of course. had to go back to work a couple of days ago. We had a few days more to presumably think about what we wanted to do. And here it is. another attempt to strip health care from over 22 million American families that rely on the healthcare insurance they have today that this reconciliation bill would take away and another attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and strip family planning and cancer screenings away from millions of women across the country. something that ultimately would add to healthcare costs. not to mention the human toll of not diagnosing cancers early. adding to the healthcare costs of this country by having to deal with far too many catastrophic events for what would have been preventable conditions. had they only been identified earlier through access to cancer screenings and family planning services at Planned Parenthood and other locations. [ 1300 This bill that will be brought under one of the rules that is coming forward today would repeal or dismantle the Affordable Care Act for the 62nd time. Again. I was hoping 2016 we would start something new. Instead. I am seeing the same kind of bill that Republicans have brought forward in 2011. they brought it forward in 2012. they brought it forward in 2013. they brought it forward in 2014. they brought it forward in 2015. and here we are. not only bringing it forward in 2016. but doing it as one of the very first bills in the very first week that this Congress is back. Look. I rise in opposition to the rule and both of those underlying bills. H.R. 1155. which is called the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome. or SCRUB Act. and H.R. 712. the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. These bills will make the American people less safe. potentially removing important safety and health regulations that are already in place for a reason. The gentleman from Georgia says. and I agree. there certainly could be unnecessary regulations on the books. Lets tackle those in a laserlike fashion. And if the Chief Executive wont do it. then lets do it through a legislative approach that targets the authority for a specific set of rules that this body agrees are not necessary or are counterproductive. as we have done in a number of instances. and go after it. rather than somehow saying that. for every rule that is added arbitrarily. another rule needs to be eliminated. there is some presumed magic to the amount of words in rules. The gentleman cited. I think it was 86.000 pages. There is no ideal amount of rules. The least amount of rules and regs that can get the job of keeping the American people safe done is the best. but you never know what that is going to be. and maybe we should strip away 10.000 pages of that. and maybe we need another thousand pages for some new technology and new device that could hurt people if there is not the right safety regulations. We need an adaptive administrative structure to allow our health and safety agencies to do their job so that when people buy a consumer product at the store. they have confidence it is not going to kill them. As a father of a 4yearold and a 1yearold. when I buy a toy and get holiday presents for our kids. I want to make sure that those products dont have lead or contaminants in them. make sure that my child wont be severely damaged or hurt by the failure of our health and safety agencies to make sure that those products are safe. That is common sense. I think that is what the American people want out of our health and safety regulators. and these bills would impede their ability to do that. Thirteen of the 16 Democrats who sat on the Judiciary Committee offered dissenting views on H.R. 712. which read. in part: ""This illconceived bill imposes numerous new procedural burdens on agencies and courts. intended to dissuade them from using consent decrees and settlement agreements to resolve enforcement actions filed to address agency noncompliance with the law."" Effectively. what that means is this bill would reduce the cost of noncompliance with our regulations and laws. These burdens include the unworkable requirements that agencies solicit public comments on all proposed consent decrees and settlement agreements. and they respond to every single public comment before submitting them to the court. Now. again. that is an administrative burden that makes it impossible for our eight health and safety agencies to do their job. You might get 100.000 comments on a particular consent decree or settlement agreement. if somebody is ramping up what we call kind of the astroturf side of trying to get people to write in about a particular topic. And to say. somehow. that every single one of those comments has to be responded to before submitting to the court is basically. not just a policy that would slow down this process. but would deter agencies from ever engaging in settlement agreements and consent decrees because it would be so prohibitive. from a staff perspective. they would effectively be unable to do their job. Like all antiregulatory proposals that have been brought forth in this Congress. H.R. 712 is another solution in search of a problem. Those in favor of the bill have failed to provide evidence to support their claim that agencies are somehow conspiring with plaintiffs to enter into consent decrees and settlement agreements. But even if you agree with that claim. this bill wouldnt solve it. All it would do is impose burdensome procedural requirements on agencies and courts that hamstring and prevent the use of consent decrees and settlements which. oftentimes. are a more efficient way for both plaintiffs and defendants to get to a reasonable outcome than interminable processes and legal bills that go on for years and years. The other bill to be considered under this rule is another example of a bill that would make the American people less safe. It is called the SCRUB Act. which is also a dangerous solution in search of a problem. Now. every branch of the government already conducts effective oversight through retrospective review of agency rules. And again. if there are rules that this body disagrees with. we should go after them. go after the authority that this body has chosen to give the agency to make health and safety regulations that keep the American people safe. Each branch of government already conducts oversight and overlooking this array of options that would provide the necessary scalpel for smart regulatory cuts. This is. instead. a meatcleaver approach that can eliminate health and safety regulations. both good and illinformed. Rather than creating jobs. growing the economy or making Americans safer. this procedure would burden agencies with additional red tape and waste valuable agency resources and taxpayer dollars at the expense of the health and safety of the American people. As my colleagues have alluded to. H.R. 1155s sole purpose is to actually obstruct the safety and regulatory process by burying agencies in endless red tape and extra costs. It would create legal ambiguity that could lead to increased cost for businesses. for local communities that rely on certainty to plan for the future. as well as uncertainty for consumers and American families who dont know that the products or services that they are buying are safe for them or their children. Now. in principle. it is hard to argue against the notion that agencies should periodically assess whether rules they have implemented should be improved or repealed. and I agree with that concept. That is not in dispute. That is not what this bill is about. Rather than streamlining rulemaking. or eliminating unnecessary rules. which we all want to do. through a thoughtful. retrospective review process. even if it is required periodically. this bill. instead. would result in years of delays for new and necessary health and safety rules by requiring a new rulemaking process for any rule that is eliminated."
1140091751,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker. there have been harrowing tales told here on the floor of the House. and there is no doubt opioid addiction is a segment of that. It is a public health crisis in this country that is hurting communities. hurting families. killing people. In 2012. enough prescriptions were written for opioids to give every single adult in this country their own bottle. Prescriptions for opioids have increased four times in the last 15 years. That is four times as many prescriptions. We need to do something. It is a start today. It is not enough. It is not enough. Unfortunately. these rules block out and prevent many creative and effective ideas from both sides of the aisle from coming to the floor. We also have missed the opportunity to provide funding to address treatment and enforcement. The fact that both parties in both Chambers have come together to tackle opioid addiction is a testament to how far the reach of this epidemic is. Every district has been affected. every Member of this body has taken note. I and many of us know families and individuals whose lives have been devastated or ended prematurely from the opioid crisis. It is crucial that we approach the problem from every possible angle: support for providers. training for law enforcement. wellfunded treatment centers. thoughtful policies for addicted parents. education for our youth. innovative dispensing technologies. alternative pain management therapies. There are so many ideas to consider. This rule packages 18 bills that address part of the problem together. Unfortunately. 16 of them dont allow amendments. and the 2 that do. many amendments were ruled out for lack of being germane. Given the rate of deaths from prescription opioid abuse. we should allow a full debate of amendments and ideas on the floor of the House to address this issue. Yes. we are taking a first step today. but there is a lot more work to do to save lives and help families across our country. We need to fund these programs so they are not just words on a page. This is a very real issue with real implications for American families. and we owe it to American families across the country to have a more open and thorough process to do more to combat the opioid scourge. I urge my colleagues to vote ""no"" on the previous question so we can bring forward Ms. KUSTERs amendment. ""no"" on the underlying rule. and ""yes"" on the underlying bills. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140097993,Mr. Speaker. I dont have any other speakers. so I will be happy to close. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker. I am going to address some of the issues in this rule and in this bill. This rule. which I oppose. and I also oppose all three underlying bills. contain a number of concepts that arent going to move forward into law. that are put there for political reasons and. again. very excitingly. the first real discussion of a national carbon tax cut. because that idea has so much bipartisan momentum from the left and the right. [ 1315 Many of these ideas are simply recycling old ideas. the same ideas that we have discussed before. that they have complained about before that if somehow they were to make it out of the Senate. the President would veto them. particularly. obviously. one that undoes what the President wants to do. so we are simply going through the motions on a lot of these bills. The most notable one is truly the resolution on a carbon tax cut because what this means is that idea has scared enough people. presumably. who oppose it that it is moving forward in some form and some discussion. which is exciting. So lets start with discussing the proposed $10perbarrel fee on oil. Now. this is. again. kind of a reaction to something that isnt happening. It is not going to change any current policy. There is no $10perbarrel fee on oil. This is simply about a Chamber saying that they disapprove of something that Obama has said and wants to do. We all agree our country has serious problems with transportation and infrastructure funding. There are many different ways that we can meet the needs to fund those. If people dont like a perbarrel fee on oil. there are plenty of other ways to do it. The real discussion should be about how do we fund transportation? I am a fan of our bipartisan proposal to allow a repatriation window for funds that corporations have income overseas which they have not brought back to our country because they effectively face another tax with that and a onetime window for doing that. We can create a national infrastructure bank to fund infrastructure. There are a lot of great ideas. It is clearand this will probably passthe Republicans dont like a $10perbarrel tax on oil. and that is fine. If you dont like it. what do you like? How do we want to fund infrastructure? This proposal and this concept came from the administrations 2017 budget. Frankly. there are probably a lot of things in the Presidents budget that my Republican friends dont like. They could probably run a resolution every week. they could probably run 10 resolutions every week about things that they dont like in the Presidents budget. but that is not really a productive use of this Chambers time. That budget didnt pass. As far as I know. I dont think that budget got a single vote. It wasnt put up this year because Republicans havent even put up any budgets for our body. They havent offered a budget. The last time the Republicans put budgets forwardand I believe the last budget. if I am not mistaken. did not contain the $10perbarrel tax on oil. That was in the Presidents budget for fiscal year 2017. but the prior one did not receive any votes from Democrats or Republicans. So this vote. at best. is repetitive because already this body has rejected the Presidents last budget. Were the Republicans to bring forward the Presidents budget for 2017. they would likelyagain. as has traditionally occurred. as far as I know. throughout historyoverwhelmingly reject that budget. So. in part. let me be clear. that is because we believe. I believe as a Member of Congress. that the budget is a legislative prerogative. I dont think there has been a Presidential budget that has been passed. In fact. I and. I think. most. if not all. of my Democratic colleagues joined in opposing the Presidents budget because we had our own congressional Democrats budget. Not only one. there were two or three congressional Democratic budgets. and there were several Republican budgets. but that is a matter of legislative prerogative. We. of course. want to hear ideas from the chief executive. whoever she is. but we also want to implement our own budget because it is our prerogative as the United States Congress with the power of the purse to do that. But considering the fact that Big Oil and Gas get huge tax subsidies every year. I personally believe that this kind of modest oil fee is a reasonable way to look at and have in the mix when talking about how to fund infrastructure. If there are other ideaspeople have talked about vehicle miles driven. people have talked about a number of different ways. There is no Republican or Democratic road. We all drive on roads. We all need roads. We all need bridges. I know the Republicans in good faith. along with Democrats. know we need to fund our national infrastructure. And if you dont like a particular way of doing that. by all means. put other ideas on the table. But it isnt productive. and it doesnt move anything forward just to take one item from a Presidents budget that you didnt even allow to have a vote and that very few people support and say: We dont like that. I think we knew that before you had the vote. I think we knew you didnt like the Presidents budget overall. You are welcome to have the vote. It isnt going anywhere. It wont pass the Senate. It isnt a matter for actual consideration. Next. we have the sense of Congress on the carbon tax cut. Again. I couldnt be more excited. I have been feeling from my friends on the right that there has been more interest in this concept of a carbon tax cut. I really see that coming to fruition that it is actually serious enough and mainstream enough that those who dont like the concept are putting up some kind of proactive defense. So I really think it is a matter of time. I think it is going to be great for our economy that we can cut taxes for American businesses. for job creators. and for middle income. We can make sure it is progressive and doesnt additionally burden many of those in poverty. It can be a net benefit to incomes of individuals below the poverty line. I couldnt be more excited about this concept of a carbon tax cut. Frankly. it is the first discussion on the floor of that concept. I believe. since Republicans have taken control of this body. and I think it is a harbinger of many things to come on something that can be great and. frankly. supported from across the ideological spectrum to make our country more competitive. Finally. I want to move to what is being called the Ozone Standards Implementation. Now. this also feels like we have been here before and done that before. It feels a little bit like deja vu because this bill essentially repackages a bunch of bills attacking Ozone Standards and the Clean Air Act that we have seen here and voted on over the last several years. Again. this bill wont pass the Senate. It certainly wouldnt be signed by the President. It is not clear why we are doing it. It seems to be filling our time. but I would hope that we have more important issues to work on on behalf of the American people. Like. for instance. the public health threat of the Zika virus is one. How about bringing up a bipartisan constitutional amendment that will help us move towards a balanced budget? How about improving our entitlement programs to make sure they are there for the next generation of Americans? How about passing comprehensive immigration reform to restore the order of law and allow 10 million people to come out of the shadows and work legally and abide by their responsibilities under American law that we can enforce going forward? I am glad that one of my amendments to the ozone bill was made in order. My colleague from Georgia mentioned that. He said he may not personally be supportive of it. I will certainly be making the case for my fourth time and hoping to gain his support. because what my amendment does is it would close an oil and gas industry loophole to the Clean Air Acts aggregation requirement. which I will be talking more about today. Currently. under current law. the oil and gas industry doesnt have to aggregate its small air pollution sources. even though cumulatively they release large amounts of air pollutants. Again. what that means in a district like mine where there are many fracking pads. there is. of course. an emission profile to each of these. but because they are small sites. they are not aggregated. We happen to have a county. Weld County. Colorado. with over 20.000 operating wells. When you get up to that kind of number. you can no longer round down to zero. In the aggregate. those wells look a lot more like a number of large. industrial plants that otherwise would fall under the Clean Air Act than simply small sites that can be rounded down to zero. I couldnt be more excited to have the opportunity to finally bring up my amendment and hopefully adopt it so we can improve the Clean Air Act instead of many of the other provisions of the bill which would eviscerate the Clean Air Act. This is a serious issue. Between 1980 and 2014. emissions of six air pollutants controlled by the Clean Air Act have dropped by 63 percent. That is good news. We should be doing more. not less. to encourage clean air with the longterm savings of the health of the American people as well as a reduction of costly diseases like asthma. A recent peerreviewed study estimates that the Clean Air Act will save more than 230.000 lives and will prevent millions of cases of respiratory problems. But instead of strengthening that act. the provisions of the bill will delay the implementation of the updated 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards by States. a position that is opposed by a broad coalition of scientists and many other groups that care about public health. The connection between air quality and asthma. of which our country has 25 million sufferers. is well established. Clean air is integral to quality of life. and the last thing we should do is tear down the protections that allow kids to play outside. and that allow adults to recreate outside and enjoy themselves while continuing to breathe clean air. Again. I am not worried about this bill becoming law. It wont pass the Senate. and. obviously. since it undoes some of President Obamas actions somehow were it to reach his desk. I am confident that it would be vetoed. The problems go on and on with this bill. I do hope that my amendment passes. It is the first opportunity that I have had to bring forward my BREATHE Act. which has over 50 cosponsors to actually bring it forward for a vote and a discussion. We havent been able to get that floor time until now. So. all in all. I think this is an encouraging week. On the one hand. we finally get to discuss a carbon tax cuthow excitingand also. we finally realize that people are actually worried enough about this happening that they are running some kind of proactive strategy to try to lock people down. Wow. This is happening. We are going to have a carbon tax cut sometime in the next few years. This is great. Second. I finally get the BREATHE Act. for it is an amendment to close a loophole for oil and gas in the Clean Air Act. Again. I dont expect that to pass. I hope to have good support. and. of course. I call upon my friends to reject the underlying bills. Instead of continuing the climatedenying work of the majority that these three bills kind of double down on. we should be focusing on creating jobs. tax reform. which. again. a carbon tax cut would allow us a foray into cutting taxes for corporations. cutting taxes for individuals. And yet again. instead of focusing on the needs of middle class Americans. instead of focusing on shrinking the deficit. instead of focusing on reducing subsidies for oil and gas companies. we are furthering our reliance on legacy. dirty energy systems to power what we hope is an economy of the future. It is the wrong way to go. I encourage Members to look in the mirror. think about the health of themselves. of their children. of their parents. the elderly. and those most at risk and ask about how those bills would impact them. The answer is obvious. and I think that. hopefully. the answer that this body gives to these bills will also be obvious. Mr. Speaker. if we defeat the previous question. I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation that fully funds the administrations effort to mount a robust and longterm response to the growing Zika crisis. Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.
1140104791,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill. H.R. 4361. Once again. this rule is not open. It does not make in order all amendments that were offered at our meeting yesterday. It makes in order some of them. but not all of them. In fact. much less would be offered here on the floor if we allowed this under an open rule where Members would have the opportunity to offer germane amendments while we were having the debate. This is a silly bill. It would simply attempt to prevent the President from being President for the rest of his term of office. We elect Presidents of the United States to 4 years in office. I understand the gentleman from Georgia may not have voted for this particular President. There have been Presidents in the past that I havent voted for. but according to our Constitution. their term is 4 years. It is a particularly silly effort because it is a bill that requires the Presidents signature. Of course. the President. rightly so. has said that he will veto it. Why would a President support a bill that says: I am agreeing to not do anything for the final 6 months of my Presidency? This bill is really more of a talking point just trying to further delegitimize the current President of the United States. It is part of a systematic effort throughout this great Presidents time in office to delegitimize him and prevent him from doing the duty to which he was elected. to serve as our Commander in Chief and chief of the executive branch in government which. of course. involves rulemaking authority. which has always been the prerogative of the executive branch. Now. we can write tighter legislation. and we probably should. That is a matter of legislative prerogative to prevent future Presidents of both parties from interpreting the authority we give them in ways that are contrary to this bodys goals. But you certainly cant fault a President when you leave them the discretionary authority in bills that pass this body to become law simply trying to make them work. Now. this is a messaging bill. again. to delegitimize the President. Well. it turns out that we Democrats have our own messaging that we want to do as well. and we are going to be spending a lot of our time here today. as we have been. talking about meaningful legislation to address gun violence. Americans have demanded meaningful action on gun violence in the wake of the worst mass shooting in Americas history at the gay club in Orlando just recently. and continual violence and the threat of terrorism continue to be a scourge in our communities. Now. before heading on the holiday break. my Democratic colleagues took strong. necessary action with regards to their actions on the floor. The demands are simple. and a number of my colleagues will talk about them. One. a vote on a bipartisan bill that the President would sign if it reached his desk that would simply expand background checks. which my home State of Colorado has already done. But. again. until we close this gun show loophole. even residents of my State that are convicted felons. who. through due process of law. lost their right to bear arms. can simply drive an hour to Wyoming and go to an openair gun show without any background check. Even though they are a convicted felon. they can purchase a weapon. So we do need a better system of background checks. and. of course. a bill to address people that are on the terrorist watch list from acquiring arsenals to commit terrorist acts. Enough is enough. Every single one of my colleagues has a personal experience with these kinds of incidents in their district. Communities have suffered long enough. and. frankly. it is time for action. We cant only do moments of silence. we need to take action. Of course. this bill we are considering is just a continuation of the Republican effort to delegitimize President Obama at the end of his term. just as many of my colleagues from the other side have attempted to do throughout his presidency. Do you know what? President Obama was elected. Do you know what? President Obama was reelected. He is the President. He will be President until January when we inaugurate a new President. Taking actions like denying him even hearings or votes on Supreme Court nominations or passing a bill saying that Federal agencies have to stop their work just because you dont like who the President is is really disrespectful to our constitutional system of governance. This bill would virtually prevent the President of the United States from doing his job by stopping all rules regardless of when the rules were proposed or how long they have been working on various regulatory improvements. It also has several provisions that are needless or antagonistic toward Federal employees. For instance. if Federal employees are underperforming or defrauding. we need to make sure that we have the tools to make personnel decisions. and this bill prevents that. Many of the majority claim that some of these ideas come from the business community. But. of course. it is not a practice in the business community to demean employees and then turn around and ask them to do more for less. Instead of wasting time on this bill that is never going to become lawit is not going to pass the Senate. if somehow it did. the President would veto it. it is not going to become lawlets start work on bills that. for instance. make it harder for terrorists to acquire arsenals to commit acts of terror. and to make sure that convicted felons cant simply cross State lines to acquire a weapon that would be illegal because there is no background check and so there is no way of finding that out. Those are the kinds of things we need to do. Lets get back to work. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.

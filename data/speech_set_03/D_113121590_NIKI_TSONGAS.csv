1130018660,"Mr. Speaker. on April 15 and in the days after. local. State. and Federal law enforcement personnel from across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and nearby States of Rhode Island and New Hampshire joined in a weeklong effort to respond to the marathon bombing and assist in finding and capturing the suspects. These dedicated first responders saved hundreds of lives in the immediate aftermath of the attack and saved countless more from the threat of future attacks. Through unprecedented communication and confident leadership. public safety agencies at every level coordinated to bring justice down upon those responsible. Their actions proved that no act of terror can blunt the spirit of resiliency. of fortitude. of endurance that is at the heart of the American people. As relief and pride wash over the Boston area. we must not forget that there is still much healing to be done. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families of Martin Richard. a young boy whose big smile we will never forget and whose sign. ""No more hurting people. Peace."" is a living challenge to all of us. Krystle Campbell. a fine young woman who. since she could. has attended virtually every marathon day. so emblematic of the great event that it is for the city of Boston. but also for the entire Commonwealth and region. Lu Lingzi. a young student from China. so emblematic of the ways in which Bostons great academic institutions draw people from across the world to share in the great treasure that we have there. but also to participate in those great days that are uniquely American. like Patriots Day. and Officer Sean Collier. somebody beloved by the student body. I had several MIT students in to see me just a couple of days ago. They said everybody knew him and everybody liked him. And the more than 200 innocent peoplea number from my districtwho suffered severe injuries from this senseless attack. we want to remember and encourage all of them as they go forward. Jeff Bauman. who suffered tragic loss of limbs. but who. as he came out of surgery. was able to help identify the suspects. The Corcoran family. a mother and daughter who are currently sharing a hospital room together as they begin the long journey of recovery but who are already having tremendous assistance. Lowell High School. where Krystle is a student. sent prom tickets to be sure that she would make her way there. And many amputees. who have successfully gone on to new lives. were in the waiting room waiting to encourage them as they go forward and to show them what is possible. Richard Donohue. Jr.. the MBTA Transit policeman who rushed to assist. doing his duty critically injured. Also from my district. Brittany Loring. Steven Byrne. James Gauntlett. David Yepez. many members of the White family. the Brassard family. and Roseann Sdoia. remarkable people who shared in a tremendous and troubling moment in our history. Id also like to remember some other specific people who have roots to my district. Commissioner Ed Davis. I have known Commissioner Davis since his early days on the beat in my hometown of Lowell. During a 28year career at the Lowell Police Department Davis worked as a beat cop. a detective. and a vice and narcotics officer before being named chief in 1994. During his time in Lowell. Chief Davis helped to turn around our city and set it off into an age of growth. We were proud of him when he left to become the Boston Police Commissioner. and we are even more proud of him now. Commissioner Davis showed extraordinary intelligence. professionalism. poise and confidence from Monday through the capture of the suspects on Friday. He was a calming influence in a time of great chaos and crisis. He deserves the thanks and gratitude of the people of Boston. of our Commonwealth. and of our country. I commend Special Agent in Charge Richard DesLauriers. who proved himself extremely capable during the entire crisis as he oversaw the massive operation of identifying and tracking down the suspects and helped bring the swift arm of justice down upon those responsible. Also. at times of great crisis we look to our leaders for guidance and confidence. Our leaderscity. State and Federaldid not shy away but rather confronted the chaos headon. challenged the evil. and pushed forward so that we could. together as one community. arrive quickly at healing and justice. In particular. Mayor Tom Menino. This mayor came from the hospital to be involved in the aftermath and suspect search. Seeing him on television in a wheelchair gave everyone a great feeling of pride. and we couldnt help but notice how deeply he cares for the city he has so ably overseen for many years. He embodies the grit and toughness that Boston is known for. He embodies Boston Strong. Governor Deval Patrick was a true leader during a time of crisis. He helped oversee the coordination of so many agencies to ensure optimal collaboration and made sure the public was up to date and aware of the situation as it developed. as we all watched moment to moment from our homes or whatever we might be. He stood with gravitas and a determined. strong composure that trickled down throughout the State public safety agencies. And we will always appreciate President Barack Obamas deep involvement since the start. His words during the service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross were a touching example of our Nations unwavering resolve. As much as we are Boston Strong. Commonwealth Strong. we are all one and we are all strong. I have to say that the interfaith service was a remarkable moment. when representatives of the many different faiths came together as we embarked on a journey of healing and reassurance about the unity. strength and resiliency that Boston is known for. It was a uniquely American day. The marathon that is much celebrated draws people from across the world. across our country. across Massachusetts. a great Red Sox gamemany go from one event to the other. and Patriots Day. which commemorates the beginning of the American Revolution. the reenactment of Paul Reveres ride. and the Shot Heard Around the World. The commemoration takes place in my district. All of that is to say that we will work hard to follow up with and be strong supporters of those who still seek to recover. make sure they have all the necessary resources going forward. and that they have the strong support of their community and friends. And we will do all that it takes to move forward from this tragic moment and to make of it something good that brings us all together and helps continue this country on a path of healing. With that. Id like to yield to my colleague from Massachusetts ."
1130028260,Mr. Chairman. this years NDAA takes unprecedented steps to address a disturbing prevalence of sexual assault in the military. and I want to thank Chairman MCKEON. Ranking Member SMITH. Congressman WILSON. and Congresswoman DAVIS for including these provisions in the bill. Id also like to thank my cochair of the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus. Congressman MIKE TURNER. In recent months. we have seen reports rise. military commanders and supervisors abuse their authority. and officers in charge of sexual assault prevention efforts allegedly commit the crimes they were sworn to stop. This is a systemic problem. and the NDAA takes real consequential actions in response. This NDAA begins to reform the power of a military commander. the first major bipartisan effort in decades to make such a significant change on the command structure. Commanders will no longer have the authority to dismiss courtmartial convictions for serious offenses. including sexual assault. and are prohibited from reducing guilty findings for serious offenses. It makes sure that those who are convicted of sexual assault will. at a minimum. be dishonorably discharged or dismissed. And this bill continues our push to provide victims of sexual assault with access to legal counsel. which is a critical step in the process of creating an environment that encourages victims to report these crimes and in bringing those responsible to justice. These. and others. are significant reforms that offer considerable momentum toward changing the deeply rooted and flawed culture that has allowed these crimes to pervade our Armed Forces. We are making progress. but there is a long way to go. Last years bill established a ninemember independent review panel to evaluate the systems used to investigate. prosecute. and adjudicate sexual assault crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The members of this panel are just getting to work now. and their input. 1 year from now. will be invaluable in making sure that Congress continues its work to make the best reforms possible and end the scourge of sexual assault. I look forward to continuing to work with many Members in both Chambers. the victims who have bravely come forward. and the committed military leaders who are all meaningfully contributing to this debate to ensure that this issue can never again be disregarded or ignored. I also want to take a moment to highlight the important work that this bill advances to develop superior. lightweight body armor for our servicemembers. While the ceramic plates which our servicemembers insert into their tactical vests have always provided the requisite level of protection in Iraq and Afghanistan. they are unfortunately still too heavy and are causing an epidemic of musculoskeletal injuries among servicemembers. which the VA will be paying for over decades to come. Last year. the NDAA contained language requiring the continued development of body armor systems for female servicemembers. as the legacy systems fit poorly. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
1130071881,"Madam Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to insert my statement into the RECORD in support of extending unemployment insurance for 1.6 million Americans instead of this radical Republican assault on womens health care rights. Madam Speaker. I want to share emails from just three of the many people I hear from each week who have been personally affected by House Republicans decision to block a vote on extending unemployment insurance. Katie from Chelmsford: ""I was laid off in April and have looked for a job since thenwith no luckIn spite of the news reports about the economy and how great the job market is. we all know that is not true. I know so many folks still looking for jobs in MAall well educated. well qualified good people! . . . I truly hope unemployment benefits are extended."" Clark from Westford: ""I am writing you regarding the stopping of the Federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. I am a married father of 2 children in local area colleges living in Westford. MA and rely on this emergency money to survive. I have been able to work 8 months this year over 3 jobs but all were temporary positions that did not lead to fulltime employment. The economy is not yet hot enough to create enough fulltime jobs and without this money our family will not make it. Please find the money to pay for extending this program as it is saving our lives . . . literally!"" Doreen from Lowell: ""Im a single mom of a great 14 year old daughter who is an honor student! (Very proud.) In May of 2013 I was laid off after 23 wonderful years of employment with the same company. This has been a life changing time for [my daughter] and myself. however we have taken the change with nothing less than a positive attitude. We have made sacrifices such as canceling our cable and Internet as well as making cuts from cell phone service to more frugal grocery shopping. ""I found out today that after 6 months of unemployment it has ended! I received a letter just two months ago that I would be extended until May of 2014. however because of Federal budget cuts this is not happening. Ive been looking and applying for jobs faithfully on a weekly basis with no luck. Nothing comes close to what I was making before. I have a mortgage by myself as a single mom... ""Ive been proud of myself for this accomplishment and being a positive strong role model has always been important to me for my daughter. I dont understand how an extension can just be cancelled like that! My daughter and I are now just our small savings account away from being homeless and thats a shame. I can only hope that someone in Congress is listening to us hard working people and will step up and do something about this. It upsets me to think after 23 years of service I cant lean on my government for support. I dont expect to be on unemployment for long but unfortunately 6 months wasnt enough. its still tough out there! I really appreciate you taking the time to read this email and please. please. please be my voice and make them hear me."" I urge my colleagues to pass an extension now and help hardworking people throughout our nation avoid economic disaster."
1130093016,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 4435. I want to begin by thanking Chairman MCKEON for his decades of service in the House and for his evenhanded tenure leading the Armed Services Committee. I also want to thank Ranking Member SMITH for his leadership and his willingness to address the tough issues that face the United States military. This years NDAA takes further necessary steps toward eliminating sexual assault in our military ranks. I appreciate the efforts of Congressman WILSON and Congresswoman DAVIS to ensure the inclusion of the FAIR Military Act into this bill. I would also like to thank my cochair of the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus and coauthor of the FAIR Military Act. Congressman MIKE TURNER. The fiscal year 15 NDAA ensures servicemembers at all levels are held to the highest standard. and no more will the socalled ""good soldier defense"" allow criminal behavior to go unpunished and prevent justice from prevailing. This NDAA also makes strides toward addressing the epidemic of suicide surrounding our military. It requires the Department of Defense to establish a system to track all suicides and attempted suicides for Active Duty. Reserves. and Guard servicemembers. as well as military family members. so that we can better understand the full scope of this tragedy. I would also like to highlight the important work that his bill does with regard to research and development. In this era of increasingly capable enemies and constrained budgets. the DOD must rapidly take advantage of technological advancements and deliver these capabilities to the field. Key provisions in the NDAA will enhance the DODs ability to recruit and retain the Nations best talent. talent needed to develop the resources that are key to keeping servicemembers safe and successful around the globe. Similarly. I was encouraged that this bill incorporates language creating opportunities for investment in critical R&D programs like the Combat Feeding program at Natick Soldier Systems. This center finds ways to make sure our servicemembers are fed and fed well in some of the worlds most unforgiving climates. Finally. I would like to thank the committee staff who worked closely with all of our staffs to include these important provisions in the bill."
1130101834,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of my legislation. H.R. 412. the Nashua River Wild and Scenic River Study Act. First. I want to thank Chairman HASTINGS for bringing this legislation to the floor. As we all know. Chairman HASTINGS will be retiring at the end of this year. so I want to especially thank him for his service on the Natural Resources Committee. and I wish him all the best. I also want to thank Ranking Member DEFAZIO. Subcommittee Chairman BISHOP. and Subcommittee Ranking Member GRIJALVA for their support of this legislation. The history and development of the towns and cities in the Third District of Massachusetts have been defined by the many rivers that course through these unique communities. From the mighty Merrimack River that supported the birth of the industrial revolution in Lowell to the Concord River where a famous shot was heard around the world. our rivers continue to play an important role in connecting our communities. but time and development have not always been kind to these rivers. Beginning in the 1700s and continuing to just a few decades ago. paper. shoe. and textile factories were constructed along the Nashua River and many other rivers in the area. The strong currents of the rivers powered the factories and made their success possible. but at the same time. the factories were releasing industrial waste right back into the rivers. polluting the very source of their success. By the mid1960s. the Nashua River was one of the most polluted rivers in the Nation. In fact. the river would change color almost daily because of the inks and dyes released into the river by the paper factories. but in 1965. one Third District resident. Marion Stoddart. realized that something had to be done. Ms. Stoddart formed the Nashua River Cleanup Committee to work toward cleaning up the river and protecting the land along its banks. Thanks to her work and to the continued work of the Nashua River Watershed Association. the Nashua River has come a long way since the 1960s. Pollution from the mills has been cleaned up. new sewage treatment plants now keep sewage out of the river. and more than 8.000 acres of land and 85 miles of greenway along the riverbanks have been permanently conserved. I cant praise Marion enough and all of the dedicated residents. volunteers. and association staff who have spent countless hours working to make sure that the Nashua River can once again be an asset and resource to the communities through which it passes. There is still much work to be done. and that is why I partnered with the Nashua River Watershed Association to introduce H.R. 412. a bill that will initiate a 3year study to determine whether. roughly. 28 miles of the Nashua River and its tributaries can be designated as Wild and Scenic Rivers. This study will allow the National Park Service. the Watershed Association. and local governments and stakeholders to work together in forming a plan to protect the Nashua River. Every town through which the Nashua River passes. in addition to several local environmental organizations. supports the adoption of this legislation. Additionally. my office just received the results of a reconnaissance survey conducted by the National Park Service. The Park Service found: The elements for a successful Wild and Scenic River Study process for the Nashua River and its tributaries in Massachusetts are in place. In 1999. 29 miles of the nearby Assabet. Sudbury. and Concord Rivers were designated as Wild and Scenic Rivers. Since then. we have seen how this designation can help protect not only the quality of the rivers but the quality of the recreational activities they support. It is my hope that the Wild and Scenic designation can be expanded to the Nashua River so that we can see the same successes there. The study that H.R. 412 will initiate is essential to starting this process. In closing. I would like to again thank Chairman HASTINGS and Chairman BISHOP for bringing this bill to the floor. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130110143,"Mr. Speaker. I thank Congresswoman BROWNLEY for allowing me to speak on this very worthwhile motion. and I rise in support. Statistics from the Department of Veterans Affairs indicate that as many as one in five women are sexually assaulted while serving in the military. But receiving benefits from the VA remains a challenge. Last year. the Service Womens Action Network. the Yale Law School Veterans Legal Services Clinic. the ACLU. and the ACLU of Connecticut released a report showing that veterans who experience sexual assaults have their benefits claims denied more than veterans with other types of PTSD. The report also found the rate of granting these claims varied greatly depending on the particular VA regional office. The St. Paul. Minnesota. office granted only 26 percent of the military sexual trauma claims they received. while the office in Los Angeles granted more than 88 percent of the claims they received. Anyone who has seen the powerful documentary ""The Invisible War"" has anguished along with Kori Cioca. Kori survived a horrific sexual assault while serving. and suffered severe injuries to her face and jaw incident to the assault. She waited for years for an answer from the VA on the jaw surgery she needed. but her claim was ultimately and shockingly denied. The VA has a long way to go when it comes to granting benefits for survivors of military sexual trauma. The Senate provisions in section 503 of the Senate bill would make sure that Congress is better informed on how the VA is treating military sexual trauma. Section 503 would also address what the VA is doing for male victims of sexual assault. According to the Defense Department. by the numbers. men in the military are more often victims of sexual assault than women. Yesterday. Senator GILLIBRAND of New York screened a documentary on Capitol Hill called ""Justice Denied."" In it. male victims tell the heartwrenching stories of being sexually assaulted. and too often being ignored by their commands after they reported an attack and isolated by their fellow servicemembers for doing so. We must do a better joba much better jobof protecting these men and taking care of them after these incidents. The Senate bill allows us to start to do that. Finally. section 501 expands eligibility for counseling services which are so important to people healing. About 2 years ago. a woman veteran came to my office to talk to me about being sexually assaulted while she was in the military. She hadnt spoken to many people about what had happened to her before. and it was difficult to do so. But she had just come from a summit where she had met a number of survivors just like her who had had similar experiences. This opportunity to meet people with similar stories and share their experiences strengthened her. She was similarly strengthened through counseling and group therapy. She has become more and more comfortable speaking about her story because of the treatment she has received. I have now seen her bravely telling her story to a rapt audience after a screening of ""The Invisible War."" I urge a ""yes"" vote on this very important motion that will help to improve care to so many servicemembers."

1130028266,Mr. Chairman. I thank my friend for yielding. and I would like to thank and congratulate him and Chairman MCKEON and their outstanding staffs for firstrate work and leadership on this issue. This bill is an example of a properly resourced and properly thoughtout plan that would serve the interests of those who serve us. As we meet tonight. there are Americas best sons and daughters stationed around the world in dangerous and often lonely places who are defending our freedom and doing us proud every single day. I do believe this budget plan is one that gives them the tools and the support that they need. It has many good things to recommend it. But I wish it were actually going to take effect. because the fact of the matter is unless this Congress acts. this plan will never take effect. Instead. it will be about $50 billion shy of the resources that were going to debate and vote on this week. Mr. Chairman. I think the whole House would be wellserved by following the example by which this legislation was put together. Led by Chairman MCKEON and Mr. SMITH. there was open. transparent. substantive dialogue throughout this process. Members on both sides of the aisle met formy goodness. was it 16 hours. 18 hours. it seemed like longer. and any idea that any Member had was brought to the body. was vigorously debated. and either approved or disapproved. There was an open process that led to a good piece of legislation. This is exactly the opposite of what weve done on the sequestration problem. There have been backroom meetings. There have been highlevel discussions. and absolutely nothing has happened. This. frankly. is a bipartisan responsibility of a national problem. I think that what is incumbent upon us doing here is the budget that has passed this Chamber and the budget that has passed the other body should be brought to a conference. and our body should select our conferees. and Im sure the other body will select its. and they will thrash out this process and. I hope. come to a resolution of this mindless. harmful sequestration process. About a third of our Navy and Air Force planes arent flying training missions because of sequestration. Theres intelligence training for intelligence units throughout the services not being done because of sequestration. Important research and development. deferred maintenance on our capital stock. isnt being done because of this problem. We have spent hours in this Chamber accusing each other of whose fault it is that we are in this box. I. frankly. think the American people are tired of hearing whose fault it is and are ready to see this problem resolved. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
1130038406,"Mr. Speaker. the purpose of this final amendment. which would not delay consideration of the bill. if passed. is to be sure that no one whos covered by their employer today suffers as a result of this bill. But make no mistake about it. the purpose of the underlying bill is to unravel the Affordable Care Act thread by thread and make sure that it collapses under its own weight. Make no mistake about it further. our purpose is forgotten around here if thats what this Congress does. We are not a debating society. We are not a perpetual political campaign. We are a legislative body that makes decisions that affect the real lives of real people in very significant ways. It is very important that all Members understand the consequences of what is being done here today. There are a lot of Americans whose lives are not being impacted here today: Among the 11 million unemployed in this country. they are hoping that next week might be the first week they get a paycheck in a long time. This House. consistent with its practice. is doing nothing. For the members of families with student loans. there are over 5 million of them who have seen their student loan rates double on the 1st of July. This House. consistent with its practice. is doing nothing for them today. For the millions of Americans who are waiting for our economy to be lifted and their lives to be lifted out of the doldrums and the shadows of an antiquated immigration law. where the other body. with 68 percent voting in favor of a change in that law. consistent with its practice. this House is doing nothing. once again. for those Americans today. But if this bill and its unraveling attempt passes. this House is doing a lot to affect a lot of other Americans: If everyone doesnt participate in paying for the health care system. the woman who has breast cancer or the little boy who has asthma. they can be denied a health insurance policy because of their preexisting condition. or it will become so expensive they cant afford it. This bill affects them. The person who overpaid for their health insurance policy. if theyre one of the millions of Americans whove gotten a rebate since the Affordable Care Act went into effect to stop insurance companies from overcharging Americans. if these folks have their way and thats repealed. this bill will certainly affect them because theyll lose that rebate. If they are among the millions of senior citizens who have been able to go for an annual checkup for a cancer screening. an annual checkup for their general health and not pay anything for it and find dreaded diseases before they take control of their lives and recover from those diseases. this bill most certainly will affect those Americans because it will repeal those benefits. For those seniors who have been caught in the socalled doughnut hole created bythe Medicare program created by the thenmajority a few years agowhove seen their drug coverage costs drop because of rebates that help them offset that coverage. they will most certainly be affected by this bill because those rebates will disappear. and their coverage will go back up and cost them more again. If theyre one of the thousands or even millions of young people who are able to stay on their parents health insurance policies until theyre 26 years of age. their lives will be affected by this bill because theyll lose that benefit and it will evaporate. This Congress has a real responsibility to Americans who want to see us move beyond this endless debate. this 38th attempted repeal of this law. who want to see us move beyond this and get to work on the real problems that confront the country. Lets put Americans back to work. Lets drop the cost of a college education. Lets fix our broken immigration system. Lets get to work on repairing the Voting Rights Act that was vandalized by the United States Supreme Court just a few weeks ago. These are problems to which we should turn our attention. but here we are again. the 38th consecutive attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The first 37 failed. and so will the 38th. The right vote for our constituents and the American people is to vote ""yes"" on this motion to recommit and ""no"" on this underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130038426,"The purpose of this amendment. which if passed would let us still proceed to final passage. is to provide protection for important consumer protections that I believe this bill puts in jeopardy. Theres probably not a Member of this Chamber who doesnt agree with the proposition that if a woman with breast cancer or a child with asthma goes to buy an insurance policy. I dont think many people here think they should be denied that policy because of their preexisting condition. or charged two or three times as much money because theyve had breast cancer or asthma or theyre a woman or theyve been pregnant. Almost everyone I hear talk about health care says Well. sure. Im for getting rid of discrimination based on preexisting conditions. But I think we all know this: you cant accomplish that if you dont have a mechanism to keep costs from exploding for everybody else in the insurance marketplace. And. ladies and gentlemen. theres only two ways to do that. The first way is to have a public fund that buys down those premium costs for people. With all due respect. the majority tried to do that and couldnt pass their bill on the floor. The second way to do it is to give everyone who can afford it the responsibility to buy health insurance for themselves. The way that we create a situation in which we can say to that woman with breast cancer. Yes. you can have a health insurance policy. and it doesnt have to be three times as much in price. or the way that we can say to that young boy with asthma. Yes. you can have a health insurance policy. and it doesnt have to be three times as much in price. is to get everyone covered. If you dont get everyone covered. then the whole thing unravels. And when it unravels. so do the other protections in the Affordable Care Act. The preexisting condition discrimination we all say we want to prevent happens anyway. The family whose child has a $1 million or $2 million chemotherapy bill runs up against a lifetime policy limit and theyre on their own again. That expires. too. The protection for young men and young women who seek coverage on their parents policy. that unravels. too. We go back to a day when the health care of the American people is in the clutches of the insurance industry and not decided between patients and their families and their physicians. We have had this argument 38 times before on this floor. But this argument has taken place outside this floor as well. Last June. the litigants went to the United States Supreme Court and said this law was no good because it was unconstitutional. But the United States Supreme Court said. Yes. it is. and were not going backwards. Last year. two Presidential candidates traveled all over this country. One called for this laws repeal. The other stood by this laws enforcement. Last November. the American people spoke and they said. Were not going backward. Well. here we are again. and the choice is backward or forward. Make no mistake about it. if the underlying bill passes. the law unravels and all the protections people say they want unravel with it. And we go back to the day when American health care was run by insurance companies and not by consumers and providers. The choice. ladies and gentlemen. is backward or forward. I say we do not go backward to a day when insurance companies ran everything. We go forward. And when that woman with breast cancer goes to apply for that health insurance policy. the answer is no longer. Maam. Im sorry. youre not eligible. You had cancer one day. The answer is. Maam. here is your policy. Here is your health security. Here is your independence from losing everything you had because you got sick. The American people are better than this repeal. Vote ""yes"" on the motion to recommit and vote ""no"" on the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130047502,"Mr. Speaker. I have not had Bob Woodward in my office. but I have had in my office a guy who remodels kitchens for a living. He told me that. even though the economy has picked up a little bit. its still not as good as it needs to be. and his concern is the one that I bring to the floor here today. I believe that the majority is putting the country on the perilous path to a government shutdown with this vote. and the government shutdown is bad enough. Its bad enough that. on October 1. I think its now likely that the people who inspect our food. that the people who now help pursue criminals at the FBI and that the people who run our National Guard Armories wont be showing up for work because of the government shutdown. Thats bad enough. The problem here is not just a government shutdownits a shutdown of the economy. Thats what this causes. The way the American economy works is. when a person at the USDA or the FBI gets a paycheck. he goes out and he has his kitchen remodeled. The kitchen remodeler is then more likely to buy a house. so the real estate broker is more likely to earn a commission. Then she is more likely to buy a car. so the car salesman is more likely to earn his commission. and hes more likely to go buy a refrigerator. The person running the appliance store is more likely to hire more people at the store. and more truck drivers have work in delivering the appliances. On it goes or on it doesnt go. When the sequester was locked in. economists in this country predicted that a third of the projected economic growth wouldnt happen. They were right. When the latest growth figures came out. instead of growing at about 2.5 percent. the economy grew at 1.7. Its not a mystery as to why. The problem here is not simply the government shutdownits the shutdown of the economy that this represents. This bill will probably pass the House. It will not pass the Senate. It represents an obsession with the health care law rather than good faith negotiation. We should begin those good faith negotiations right now. We should have on the floor right now a proposal that Mr. VAN HOLLEN has made for a very long time that says: lets get rid of the sequester for a period of time. lets not lay off the person at the National Guard Armory or the FBI or the USDA. and lets replace the spending cuts with a fair and honest set of proposals that would include things like taking tax breaks away from oil companies that are making billions of dollars a year. We are not getting a chance to vote on that today or tomorrow. and I suspect I know the reason whybecause it would pass. It would keep the government running. It would further reduce the deficit. It would put more Americans back to workbut it doesnt fit the political script of the majority. Vote ""no"" on the rule and ""no"" on the bill."
1130052397,Mr. Speaker. I say good morning to our colleagues. and hope that as we focus on the very real pain and burden that so many Americans are feeling that we can act this afternoon to alleviate that pain. whether someone is looking for health care services from the National Institutes of Health. or whether they are troubled by the problems at the FAA that Mr. LOWENTHAL just talked about. or whether they are veterans or a person in our police departments or military. that we can alleviate the suffering they are feeling and we can again have taxpayers receive the services for which they are paying by passing the Senate shortterm budget this afternoon. Its pretty clear to me that a significant majority of House Members would vote in favor of that budget. It should be put on the floor. If I am wrong. it will fail. But we will have a vote. I think Im right. I think the bill will pass. the government will reopen. and the shutdown will end. Thats the way we ought to proceed. If a majority of this House believes that thats the right thing to do. the majority should be given the chance to vote on that particular piece of legislation. I hope we can also focus on the longlasting damage thats being done to the way we govern our country by what has happened here. I want to say from the outset that I feel strongly that the Affordable Care Act is a good thing for our country. I really do believe that thats going to do many good things for our country. But I completely respect and admire those who have a completely different opinion. I know that there are many Members of this Chamber. and many people in our country who believe that the Affordable Care Act is very bad for our country. They would like to see it repealed. They believe it will do harm to the country. I respect and admire their zeal and their passion. This is the essence of the democratic process. We are fortunate to live in a country where when we disagree over something we resolve our disagreements with voting. with elections. with peaceful and civil processes. But when that peaceful and civil process protects the rights of those who have lost an argument. as frankly those over the Affordable Health Care Act have. when it respects your right to continue to come back and pursue your views over that argument. you also have to respect that process in return. And grave damage is being done to that process because of this practice of threatening a shutdown of the entire government. in fact causing a shutdown of the entire government. and now threatening a default on the countrys obligation to pay its bills by tying the health care debate to the extension of the Federal debt ceiling. And I want you to think about what is happening here. The health care legislation came to this floor and passed. It went to the Senate floor and it passed. The President signed it. It was challenged in the United States Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court said it complied with the Constitution. We had an election a little less than a year ago. where one candidate promised that the very first thing he would do would be to repeal the law. and the other candidate promised he would implement the law. The candidate who wanted to repeal the law lost. lost in the Electoral College by a substantial margin. lost the popular vote by about 51 to 47 percent. That does not mean that those who agree with Governor Romney have to abandon their efforts and try not to repeal the law. The democratic process says they have at their means every legitimate mechanism to try to win the next time around. Thats part of the beauty of American politics. there is always a next time around. But it is not a legitimate means to shut down the entire government of the United States because you lost the last time around. Let me draw some analogies here. Virtually everyone on our side believes passionately that the Senate immigration bill. which would provide legal status to 12 million people. the vast majority of whom are decent. taxpaying. hardworking people who are benefiting the United States. we believe passionately that that bill should become law. Sixtyeight Senators voted for that law. It has never been put to a vote on the House floor. We feel passionate that should become law. but we did not threaten to shut the government down if we didnt get a vote on that. It looks like we may lose that argument. If it doesnt come to a vote. we are not going to shut the government down because we cant get our way. A huge majority of people on our side. a huge majority of the American people. if you believe the polls. believes that there should be a background check before someone can buy a gun. Before a wife beater or a terrorist can buy a gun. there ought to be a background check that says whether they can buy one or not. Again. we are damaging the political process by this. and we shouldnt do it.
1130052513,"I thank my friend for the time. Mr. Speaker. theres been an avalanche of talk from both sides. an avalanche of opinion. Thats democracy. I think there is one indisputable fact. and that is the one way to end the government shutdown today is for the House to pass the Senate bill and send it to the President. That would end the shutdown immediately. Now. its my opinion that a majority of Members of the House would vote in favor of that proposal if it reaches the floor. I think thats what would happen. But its my conviction. and I think it should be our shared conviction. that we ought to take a vote on it. We ought to let all 433 Members that are present here cast a vote on whether they want the Senate bill to pass or not. and if our side wins. fine. If our side loses. thats fine too. Thats democracy. After this avalanche of talk. there is going to be a chance. in a few minutes. for people to actually vote on this question. and this is not the technical. procedural language. but its the reality language. What this votes really going to ask is this: Do you want the government shutdown to continue or not? If you vote ""no"" that you dont want the government shutdown to continue. the Senate bill will come to the House floor this afternoon. and well take that vote. If you vote ""yes."" then the Senate bill will not come to the House floor. and well continue on this everlasting process of burdening the American people. talking the issue to death. and not getting anything done. I think we owe it to the American people to all stand up and raise our hands. either say ""yes"" or ""no"" on the Senate bill. If your answer is ""no."" your answer is ""no."" Mine would be ""yes."" But the way to make that happen is to cast this vote in a few minutes. The question on this vote is. Do you want the government shutdown to continue or not? If your vote is ""no."" then we vote on the Senate bill. If your vote is ""yes."" then we dont. and the shutdown continues. The American people deserve this vote. Mr. Speaker. give us this vote."
1130058257,I thank my very good friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker. so you are in the lunchroom at work. This guy comes in from the investment house. and he shows 18 slides about the red fundsmiling people who are on fishing trips and on European vacations. They are really happy people. He shows one slide about the blue fund at the very end and finishes his presentation. The red fund looks pretty good. What he doesnt tell you is that he gets 21/2 percent of every dollar you put into the red fund. but 1/2 of 1 percent of every dollar you put in the blue fund. He neglects to mention that. So people rush and put their money in the red fund. Now. should his interest be aligned with you or should his interest be aligned with his own interest? That is the question that is raised by this bill. The Department of Labor is writing a rule that for the first time would say that that person standing in front of you in that room has a fiduciary obligation to the person listening. that is to say that he has to put the interest of the listener ahead of his own financial interest. Selfinterest is the malignancy that brought the U.S. economy to its knees 5 years ago. People who made mortgage transactions and insurance transactions benefited them and not the people they are supposed to be representing. To permit the cancer of selfinterest to invade the second most important asset people have in their lifetime. which is their pension. would be an enormous mistake. That is a mistake that this Department of Labor rule is trying to avoid. This bill is a mistake because it rolls back those efforts and protections for the American people. John Bogle. the founder and patron of Vanguard. has estimated that nearly 30 percent of peoples pension funds have evaporated because of unnecessary fees. If people want to choose a highfee plan. that is their choice. but they should make that choice only after receiving the advice that is fiduciary. that is directed to their own best interest. from a competent professional. The Department of Labor rule promotes that result. this bill undercuts that result. For that reason. we should oppose this bill.
1130069145,"Mr. Speaker. I rise this morning in appreciation. Next week. I am leaving the Congress to pursue the chance to build a career in the private sector. I wanted to take a few minutes this morning to offer appreciation and thanksgiving for a lot of people who have helped make this wonderful experience possible. I start with. as in all things in my life. my wife. Camille. and my daughters. Jacquelyn and Josie. without whom nothing good would be possible and through whom all good things are. I look forward to many. many more happy years. God willing. with them and thank them for their support and sacrifice. I thank my staff. Over all of these years. these men and women are overworked. underpaid. and underappreciated. sometimes by their employer. These are true public servants. They are inspirations. and I assure you that I have learned much more from them than I have taught to them. I want to single out. in particular. in the present staff. our chief of staff. Fran Tagmire. our general counsel. Amanda Caruso. and our legislative director. J.Z. Golden. for their excellence. and for many. many others over many. many years. I want to thank my colleagues. I thank Speaker BOEHNER for his friendship and leadership. I especially thank the first woman Speaker of the House of Representativesin my view the best Speaker of the House of RepresentativesNANCY PELOSI. who has taught me strength and principle and doggedness and focus. and whose inspiration will guide me. my daughters. and others sons and daughters for many years to come. I thank her profoundly for her influence and service. I thank all of my colleagues. I want to come back to that in a minute. I most especially thank the people of the First Congressional District of the State of New Jersey. who have been the best employer one could possibly have for these last 24 years. And. yes. I would include the people who stop us in the supermarket and complain about a vote that we have cast or wonder why we havent solved a problem. There are a few of them. There are many. many more whose words of encouragement have lifted us up for all these years. and I assure you that we appreciate you. and we are staying in our community and looking forward to new ways that we can serve our friends and our neighbors. I especially. though. do want to come back to the men and women with whom I have had the privilege of serving for all these years. We have done a lot of things that are good together. Some of us have not always agreed on what is good together. but we passed the Affordable Care Act. which I believe will withstand the test of time and will stand together with Medicare and Social Security as pillars of middle class prosperity and American opportunity. We have opened the door for college students with the direct student loan program that has helped many. many millions of students get an education. We have improved our environment. In our district at home. there are construction workers building transportation projects today because of our work. There are police and firefighters and teachers on the job because of our cooperation. There are two veterans health clinics. We can simply not say thank you with our words to our veterans. but by our deeds. And I must say this morning that I especially remember young men and women on duty around the world serving our country. and I express my deepest appreciation to them. But to my colleagues. I would say this. that I have had 150.000 constituents over the years come to our office with various issues and problems. and they are certainly an inspiration. But so. too. ladies and gentlemen. are you. my colleagues. The House is a rambunctious and energetic place. I suspect we will see some of that rambunctiousness even later today. We have seen a little bit this morning. People should not confuse debate with division. Healthy. passionate debate is the elixir of American democracy. It is the fuel that makes the country better. And for those who look at the House and say. well. all they ever do is argue with each other. I would certainly hope so. I would certainly hope we would bring to this Chamber deeply held beliefs. deeply held convictions. and express them in the course of debate. Of course. there is time for compromise. and there is always a season to get the job done. but may this place never lose the strong convictions of people. right and left. Republican and Democrat. north. south. east. and west. because that is what makes democracy go. I would also say this. that we. in this Chamber. should never confuse a difference of opinion with a difference of intention. I have served here for nearly 24 years. and I can safely say I have never met a fellow Member who does not love this country. who was not here for the purpose of improving this country as he or she sees that improvement. I have certainly disagreed with the definition of ""improvement."" but I have never questioned the motivation or motive of any of the men and women with whom I have had the privilege of serving. So my admonition would be: Keep the energy flowing. Those who misunderstand debate. let them misunderstand it. Keep the passionate beliefs that occupy this place going. And when we do. I believe with great confidence that the institution will continue to lead the way to a country that is more prosperous. more safe. more free. and more generous than any nation in the history of the face of the Earth. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve. I thank each of you who has given me this privilege."
1130071044,I thank my friend from New Jersey for his tireless leadership on this very important cause. It is inspirational. Mr. Speaker. since the Affordable Care Act became law. 9 million Americans have health insurance who did not have it before9 million people. Now. not surprisingly. there have been problems in the implementation of the law. Many customer service problems need to be addressed. and we should come together in good faith and make sure they get addressed. This bill takes us in the opposite direction. It says that people who could be working on solving the very real and important problems of customers who are trying to enroll in health insurance will have to write a report once a week instead of once a month. If you go to get your car fixed and if there is a long line of people ahead of you and if you are going to be late to get back to work and if you find out the reason the line takes so long is that the person at the counter explains the history of the carburetor to every person who comes to pick up his car instead of waiting on the people who are in line. requiring a report a week instead of a report a month just doesnt make any sense. There is another reason to oppose this bill. though. that is even more important than that. Today. 10.000 Americans will go home and tell their children or their loved ones that they have run out of income because their unemployment benefits have expired. This week. 72.000 Americans will have that happen to them. There is a bill in this House. on this floor. that could be taken up this morning and voted on to provide relief to our neighbors and family members who are in that position. This majority leadership has ignored that legislation. This is a breathtaking misplacement of priorities. We can spend an hour of the Houses time on harassing Health and Human Services into filing one report every week instead of one report every month. but we cant take 5 minutes and debate on a bill that will restore a measure of decency and income to 72.000 Americans a week. Many of these Americans are over 50 years old. For every one job that is advertised there are three people looking for that job. The callous indifference of the House majority leadership to these people is just wrongand so is this bill. We should reject this bill and. instead. proceed with a vote on aid to Americas longterm unemployed.

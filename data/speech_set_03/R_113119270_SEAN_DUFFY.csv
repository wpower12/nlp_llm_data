1130010538,Mr. Chairman. Im happy to hear my friends across the aisle talk about investing in our future and investing in our economy. But when they talk about that. I think we have to be clear that thats code for borrowing and spending more money. We should truly talk about the cost of this debt. We all know today that we owe $17 trillion in debt. and if the Federal Reserve stopped printing money. the actual cost to service this debt. to pay the interest payments would be about $500 billion. You go out 10 years and our debt is going to be $25 trillion. And minimally to service our interest payments on that debt 10 years from now. its going to cost us $750 billion a year. or $7.5 trillion over 10 years. If you talk about the cost of interest payments every year to service the debt. thats $750 billion that isnt going into education. its not going into health care. its not going into roads or schools or helping our poor. Its $750 billion that goes to interest payments. When you talk about investing in our future. were not doing that. We are mortgaging our childrens future. But lets be clear. There is someone who is investing in their futureits the Chinese. Theyre investing in their future by buying American debt. So when my little girls. my little 2yearold Mari Vi and my 4yearold Paloma. when they get to be our age. theyre going to have this weight of interest and debt around their neck and theyre going to pay those payments back to those Chinese preschoolers. This is not responsible. And to hear my colleagues across the aisle stand up and talk about a balanced approach that continues this course of massive red. this is what our children inherit and say this is what we want to give to them? Listen. if you ask moms around America. Is this what you want for your children? Is this what you want them to inherit? Is this how you want them to invest their tax dollars? They would resoundingly stand up and say. Heck no. Be responsible. Pay off the debt. We dont want them to have their massive tax dollars go to interest payments. My friends across the aisle. they talk again about borrowing and spending and investing in our economy. When they use that language. it sounds eerily familiar to the same language they used 4 years ago. This is the same argument that was used to borrow a trillion dollars to help us grow our economy. create massive new jobs. The bottom line is that that trilliondollar stimulus failed. We want a responsible approach. balance the budget. grow our economy and put our hardworking middle class families back to work. The Republican budget actually does that. I ask all my colleagues to actually support the Republican budget.
1130010594,I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. I want to shed a little light on what has been discussed on the floor tonight. Mr. Chairman. We are hearing a lot of conversation about Medicare. We have to be clear that. in ObamaCare. this was the largest health care reform bill this country had ever seen. Its going to spend $2 trillion of deficit spending over the next 10 years. With that massive new health care reform bill. guess what? Medicare is going broke in 10 to 12 years. So with this great health care reform. they didnt have enough foresight to save our seniors Medicare program. the program theyve actually paid for over the course of their lifetimes. I think our seniors deserve better than what theyve received in ObamaCare. We hear a lot about what weve done with the $716 billion in ObamaCare. Lets be clear between the two plans. My friends across the aisle want to take $716 billion of savings from Medicaretake that money outand use it for a different set of people in ObamaCare. They want to use it for people who didnt pay for the program. On our side of the aisle. we want to take that savings and use it for our seniorsits their money. they deserve to get itand we use it to shore up the program. This makes sense. You talk about facts and numbers. think back to what the President told us with regard to ObamaCare. He said. Listen. youre going to see your health care costs go down by $2.500 a year per family of four. The truth? What happened? Health care costs went up by $3.000 a year for a family of four. Thats a $5.500 turnaround for a family of four in his health care reform bill. Listen. thats a lot of money for hardworking American families. Lets talk about what else has been discussed by my friends across the aisle. If you recall the stimulus bill. a trillion dollars in spending. remember. we were supposed to spend a trillion dollars and get an unemployment rate by 2013 of 5.2 percent. Well. the reality is were sitting at 7.7 percent. But if you add back in everybody who has stopped looking for work because they cant find it because this has been one of the longest and lamest recoveries since the Great Depression. its actually up at 10 percent. Listen. these policies and these promises havent worked for the American people. Lets talk about taxes. We have a plan that will reform the Tax Code. It will make it fairer. flatter. simpler. easier to use. and we root out the loopholes. take away the preferences and the exemptions. We get away from crony capitalism. A fairer code. You have a chance to vote for that kind of tax reform in our budget. But lets compare that to what my friends across the aisle propose. Well. a trillion dollars in tax increases in ObamaCare. $600 billion of tax increases in the fiscal cliff.
1130018649,I appreciate my friend from Texas yielding. Over the past 5 months. our Nation has seen unspeakable horrors bestowed upon the children of our country. from the massacre in Newtownthe 23 innocent. young first graders who lost their livesto just recently in the Boston bombing. where many lost their lives. but specifically. a third grader. Richard Martin. lost his life. Richard. a couple weeks before. had just made his First Communion. There is a picture of Richard in a sharp white suit with a proud. toothless smile. He lost his life in Boston. His little sister. Jane. who was by him was also hit by the bomb. She lost her leg. She was just starting to take Irish step dancing classes. She will now be in recovery for months and years from that bombing. We have to look at whats happening in our country with regard to violence against children. As a country. we have to soulsearch about violence against our children. and we have been soulsearching. Our families. our communities. weve been soulsearching in this institution about that very violence. Weve had a conversation about: How do we protect our children? How do we keep them from this violence and scourge that is spreading across our country? But we soulsearch. Meanwhile. in Philadelphia. dozensif not hundredsof babies have had their lives taken from them. where theyve been murdered. left to lay in cardboard boxes. left in toilets trying to swim for air. only to have the backs of their necks snipped. basically decapitated. That kind of horror is being bestowed on children in America. and yet where is the media? Where are the protests? Where are the congressional hearings? Listen. where are the parents on Air Force One flying to the White House having a meeting with the President? Where are the highpowered meetings with the Senators across the aisle? Theyre not happening. I dont have the picture for you today. but many have seen it. a picture of the courtroom where the Kermit Gosnell trial is going on. Theres a section reserved for the mediathe media that loves great stories. loves fanfare. Theres a section reserved for the media at this trial and theres nobody there. Theres been a blackout. The media has refused to cover this story. How about a poor. immigrant mother who cant speak English. who looks to her local community organization in Philadelphia. who gets a recommendation for an abortion to go to the nicesounding Womens Medical Society clinic. a clinic that is well known for its filth and well known for its health violations. Poor minority immigrant goes to this clinic for an abortion. and she loses her life. So I think we have to ask: Where is NARAL? Where is NOW? Where is Mrs. BARBARA BOXER. standing up for poor minority women who are losing their lives in Philadelphia at the hands of an abortion provider? Where are they? The silence is deafening. Cant hear them. Theres no voice given to that poor minority immigrant. There is no voice given to these little babies who are so vulnerable at the start of their lives and theyre voiceless. But no oneeven those who say they stand up for women and babies. theyre unwilling to stand up at this time. However. if you are a white. privileged law student from this town. the doors swing wide open and the media wants to cover your story. They want to cover your point of view. But when were talking about an abortion clinic that provides lateterm. partialbirth abortions where babies are born alive. there is no outrage. there is no story. Where is the NAACP for these minority babies? Where is La Raza? Where is the Black Congressional Caucus? Where is MAXINE WATERS? Where is the leader of the Democrat Party? Where are they. lending their voice to these atrocities. this murder? You know. Im a father of six. Ive been there for the birth of all my babies. I know we have a lot of parents in this institution and across the aisle. Listen. newborn babies coming out. they are voiceless. theyre defenseless. they rely on us for everything. Heres a picture of my sixth baby. MariaVictoria. Mighty V. just born. The pictures of the babies that died in Philadelphia are bigger than this. theyre more developed than this. And yet no one wants to stand up and shed light on these atrocities and these unspeakable horrors. the dehumanization. the desensitization of what happened in Philadelphia. I think we have to ask ourselves why. Why arent my good friends on the other side of the aisle. who have families. who have had children. who care about minorities and the poor and care about childrenI know it because I hear themwhere are they? Why wont they join us to expose this? Is it that they care more about the abortion clinics than poor defenseless babies that are born alive and arent provided care. arent provided love. but are abandoned and left to die? I cant believe thats true. Is it that they agree more with partialbirth abortions that are botched and babies are born alive and theyre not willing to provide aid? I cannot believe that. not offering lifesaving treatment for the most vulnerable among us. I think we have to look around in our communities. in our country. we have to look at this very institution. and we have to be better than this. We are better than this. We might disagree on abortion. Im a prolife guy. I know we have a lot of people who are proabortion in this institution. I can accept those distinctions. But how can anybody come forward who even supports abortion and say. Im not going to defend a baby thats born alive? What kind of position is that? Or that you wont lend your voice to this cause? You can come out and say. I support abortion. but I dont support this. This is wrong. Were better. as Americans. than that. Were better Congressmen and -women than that. We have bigger hearts than that. This is unacceptable in our country. Were going to have the abortion debate for a while. and thats okay. but we have to draw the line somewhere. When do we step forward and say we are going to defend the most defenseless and the most voiceless among us? When does that start? I think in this institution most of us have agreed that that starts at birthat least. I think it starts at conception. but everyone has agreed it starts at birth. So why. when we have this atrocity. this death of our children in Philadelphia with Dr. Gosnell. havent people loaned their voices to these children? They deserve better than that. So I think its incumbent upon this institution. our communities. our country. and the media to make sure that we provide a voice. we provide a platform for those babies because we care more about those lives than we care about the abortion industry. and we care more about those babies than we care about exposing the horrors and atrocities of partialbirth abortion. Were better than that. Im going to tell you this: though we may disagree on some issues. we do agree on protecting these little ones as they come into the world. Im going to continue that fight. I know the gentleman from Texas is passionate on this topic and has a lot of things to talk about today. but I appreciate him yielding a few minutes for me to chat.
1130037924,Mr. Speaker. I think its important for all of us to stand strong. stand tall and lead. listen. communicate on this very important issue. And I know thats what we want to do here tonight is throw out ideas. but also prepare ourselves to listen to what our constituents want. what America wants and whats right for the country. I hear some folks on my side of the aisle talk about if you pass a border security bill. youre going to go to conference with the Senate and youre going to adopt the Senate bill. We dont go to conference unless we agree to it. Thats not going to happen. Let me be very clear. Were going to do a stepbystep approach and get a solution to immigration and then well talk about going to conference. if thats the pathway forward. But its not one phase of the bill. then to Congress. Ive got others that say just enforce the current laws. and to those I would ask: How is that working for us? Its not working. We have to engage in this conversation and do whats right. Ive got one more story for you. Theres a family that came from Mexico over to Arizona. and they had an opportunity to work in the mines in Superior. Arizona. hard work. tough work. They were Catholic. They raised a lot of kids on not a lot of money. But one of their kids. as he grew up. he learned how to make pinatas and sell those pinatas. He learned how to get fruit of the desert. chop it up. slice it. dice it. and sell it as a delicacy within his community. a little entrepreneur. When he got older he had a shot to go work in the mines like his brothers. but instead he said. You know what? I want to serve my country. And he went into the military. He had a chance to serve under Ronald Reagan. And he came from a party thats not mine. but he had a chance to serve under Ronald Reagan. and he had to see what a party of opportunity had to offer him and his community and his family. He changed his vote. He said. This is whos looking out for me. This is whos looking out for my opportunity. and this is whos going to look out for my children and my grandchildren. He went on. got married to a woman in Spain who immigrated here legally. and they had four kids. And I was honored enough to meet their daughter and marry her and move her to northern Wisconsin from warm Arizona. where we now have six children together. Thats my wifes immigrant story. whose father came here as a firstgeneration American. who worked his heart out and has his shot at the American Dream. After the military. he became a schoolteacher. and now he works for a university. Hes living the dream. His daughter is living the dream. All of us have those stories. My parents. my greatgrandparents came from Ireland. We all have the story of an immigrant. Im here to say. lets open our hearts. Lets open our minds. Lets have a real discussion that works. But lets also first say secure the border so we dont deal with this again. and then do whats right by way of folks who have come here and want their shot at the American Dream.
1130069194,Mr. Chairman. thank you for yielding. Madam Speaker. just to be clear. the bill that is before the House today is not a repeal bill of the CFPB. It is a modification. a reform package to the CFPB. So when my colleagues and friends across the aisle talk about how there will be no consumer protection. that is absolutely false. We just want to make sure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau works better and is more responsive to the American people. So I want to talk about a few of the things that this bill does. The first thing is it moves the Director of the CFPB over to a bipartisan commission of five. Now. I know my friends across the aisle have taken issue with this. However. when. under DoddFrank. the CFPB was originally envisioned by House Democrats and the former chairman Barney Frank. they didnt have a single director. they actually had a commission. When ELIZABETH WARREN. now Senator WARREN. envisioned this package. it wasnt a director. it was a commission. So now that my friends across the aisle take issue with the reform package that has a commission and not a director. it was their original idea. So lets not play partisan politics. Lets join together on points of agreement. and this is one of them. Another concern. the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is not responsive to Congress because it doesnt get its funding from Congress. It doesnt go through the appropriations process. which gives us great oversight here in the House. Their funding comes from the Federal Reserve. We think it is appropriate. when you have an agency that is so powerful and so unaccountable. that we give the elected Members of the American people power to say how much money they should have and how they should use it. We dont have that ability right now. And who on Gods green Earth says that we should take power away from Congress and let them set their own budgets? Going to the point of unaccountability. the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sets their own pay. Where in the freemarket system does any employee tell the employer. This is what you are going to pay me. I am setting my own pay? That is what they do at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And all we say is we. the Congress. the elected representatives of the American people. we should set the pay of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These are commonsense reforms that actually work for the American people. and. frankly. it will work for the CFPB to make them far more accountable. The way this bill is set up. not the bill. the law. the way the law is set up. big banks on Wall Street. the very big banks that caused the financial crisis. they are actually able to go and have consumer financial protection rules reviewed by FSOC. and if FSOC thinks that the rule as petitioned by big banks can create systemic risk. the rule can be overturned. So big banks on Wall Street. they get a voice. They get to go: This is bad for us. overturn the rule. If you come from rural Wisconsin. where we only have small community banks and credit unions. and you see one of our small financial institutions going to FSOC and saying. Hey. this rule is bad for us. the small banks and credit unions. please overturn the CFPB rule. they are going to laugh them out of FSOC. They dont have a voice. Small financial institutions. credit unions. and small banks dont have a choice to go to FSOC and have a ruled overturned by the CFPB. The way the law was written and the way it has been implemented. they have given a big. loud voice to Wall Street banks but have shut out the small community banks and credit unions that are all over America. the very banks and institutions that lend money to our families. the very institutions that our small businesses on Main Street America. they go to and ask. Will you give me a loan so I can expand my business. maybe create an extra job or two in America? Those are the ones that have been shut out in the review process by the CFPB. That doesnt work for consumers. That doesnt hurt consumers. That actually helps consumers. and that helps small town America. I think one of the most important portions of this reform billand again. it is a reform bill. it is not a repeal billis what we do in regard to data. America has recently learned that the NSA is collecting phone data and information on them and keeping it. Now Americans have said. Listen. I am okay with AT&T or Verizon. whoever my phone company is. that they have my records. But the American people have never given the American government permission to take their phone records. and when they heard about it. they were outraged. They were outraged. I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are supportive of this expansive NSA. they are supportive of a big government taking information on Americans. but most Americans say. no. we dont want that kind of relationship between the American citizenry and our government. Just like the NSA. the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is collecting financial data on the American citizenry. They are collecting information on almost 1 billion credit cards. I will say that again. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is collecting data and information on almost 1 billion credit cards. and I would ask. Do you think they have asked permission of the American people to take their financial data? Absolutely not. All we ask for in this reform bill is. if you want to take Americas financial information and you say that you are here to protect the American citizenry. why dont you ask them? Ask if you can take it because I guarantee I know what they are going to say. They are going to say: No way. I am okay with my bank having this information. my credit union having this information. but I will be darned if I want some agency that says they are here to protect me to collect my financial information and my financial records.
1130076421,Mr. Chairman. I thank the chairman for all the work that he has put in on this consumer financial protection reform bill. This is really a bill about accountability and transparency. As has been discussed today. the CFPB is collecting information on almost 1 billion credit cardsi billion credit cardswhich means if you are an American and you have a credit card. the CFPB is collecting and monitoring your transactions. So what we have done is said: Listen. if you are here to protect a consumer. why dont you ask the consumer for permission and consent to take their information? If we care about the American citizenryif we care about consumers and dont care about Big Government and the information they have on us. lets give them the power. Lets ask them. That is all we do. Empower the American citizenry. Again. lets empower Congress and the American people as well. When we dont fund agencies through this institution. we lose authority. we lose oversight. Lets take that power and control back into Congress. and lets actually put the power back in the hands of the people. but if you empower the Fed to fund this agency. you have taken the control away from this institution. That is wrong. One of the most important reform parts of this bill is meaningful to me because I come from rural America. and the way that the law is structured is that if a bad rule comes from the CFPB. it can be overturned. You can go to FSOC and say: Listen. this rule is going to create systemic risk. meaning. it is going to have a negative impact on our economy. It should be overturned. Now think about what kind of financial institutions can go to FSOC and say: This rule is bad. overturn it. Is it the small community bank? Is it the credit union in rural America? Heck. no. But if you are a big Wall Street bank. you have been given a voice in the way my friends across the aisle have structured this law. Big banks on Wall Street who created the crisis are given a voice to have rules from the CFPB overturned. but you have left the small banks and credit unions in my district voiceless to say: this rule is going to hurt us. That is wrong. Listen. we want to talk about protecting consumers. giving a voice to consumers. making sure Big Government isnt breathing down their backs. Want to know who protects consumers and finance? Our credit unions. our small community banks. And guess what? The Credit Union National Association. they endorse and support our bill. The National Association of Federal Credit Unions endorsed and support this bill. The Independent Community Bankers endorsed and support this bill. This is the right thing to do. Lets empower Congress and empower the American people. Lets reform the CFPB and actually make it work.
1130080036,"Mr. Speaker. today I rise to discuss the issue of Medicare and Medicare reimbursement payments to doctors who provide health care for our seniors. Currently. the reimbursement formula for our doctors who provide these services is one that has become so low that many doctors in America arent providing services and care to our seniors. It brings me to a bill that is coming up tomorrow in the House. It is the doc fix. It is a fix to the SGR. What that means is. there is on the horizon a 24 percent cut coming to Medicare reimbursements for our doctors who provide care for our seniors. If that cut goes into effect. it is going to have a devastating impact on the care that our seniors can receive. So tomorrow we are going to have a fix on the floor that takes away the threat of the 24 percent cut. and we pay for it. What we do is we bring certainty to the doctors who provide this care for our seniors and stability to the payment system. Now. this isnt the first time this issue has been brought up. This has been an ongoing problem. and so today. on throwback Thursday. we are going to take a trip down memory lane. Four years ago. during the ObamaCare debate. House Republicans brought up this very issue and said: Listen. lets not hold our seniors hostage. Lets actually come forward together and have a doc fix that is paid for to make sure our seniors dont get cut in regard to reimbursements. My colleagues across the aisle said ""no"" to this fix that was paid for. and in the end we have had to have shortterm fixes that I think threaten the care for our seniors. I hope all my colleagues tomorrow will stand with us to have a longterm fix to this program. to make sure our seniors arent held vulnerable to potential inaction by Congress. I also want to talk about what happened in regard to our seniors in the ObamaCare debate. Instead of fixing payment in Medicare to our doctors for our seniors. instead of shoring up a plan that helps our seniors. instead of doing that. what my friends across the aisle did in ObamaCare is they looked for a payfor. and they saw a pot of money in Medicare. and they took almost a trillion dollars out of Medicare to use for ObamaCare. News flash: the CBO. and the President. everybody acknowledges that Medicare is on a pathway to going broke. Twelve years from now it runs out of money. So instead of shoring up the fund. making sure that we meet the promise to our seniors. my friends across the aisle took almost a trillion dollars out of it. making it more vulnerable. Then. a program that works well. especially for my seniors back in Wisconsin. Medicare Advantagetaking money out of Medicare Advantage. a program that actually works. giving some choice and control to our seniors. I think our seniors deserve better than this. The war on the seniors should stop. and is going to stop hopefully tomorrow with a bipartisan effort that does what we should have done in the ObamaCare debate but fixes payments to doctors so they can continue to provide lifesaving health care to our seniors. Lets stand together as a House. Lets stand with our seniors. Lets get this done tomorrow."
1130086118,Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. as I sit and listen to this debate today. there is no doubt the Democrats position is lets just keep the status quo. dont change anything. lets continue on with our $17 trillion debt. lets continue to borrow and spend and spend and borrow and never change course. We know that is their position by way of the amendments they offered in the Budget Committee and by the conversation you hear on the floor today. Mr. Chairman. we also know that. by way of the Senate budget. when they put one out. because it never balances. and we know that because of the Presidents budget that he puts out. because it never balances. It passes off this massive liability to the next generation. and their policies have a real impact on the country as a whole. We talk about seniors. The Medicare trust fund is going broke in 12 yearsit is going bankruptand my friends across the aisle. Mr. Chairman. dont want to change it. They want to leave our seniors today and our future seniors in jeopardy with a trust fund that is going broke. It is hard to lead. It is hard to put ideas on the table and say: listen. my friends. lets come together. lets be responsible. lets make it sustainable. lets fix itwhen the response is: dont do a darned thing. continue on the course to a bankrupted trust fund. That doesnt serve our seniors well. That doesnt serve our next generation of seniors well. Speaking of Medicare. there is only one party in this town that took over $700 billion out of Medicare and used it for ObamaCarethey raided itand that is the Democrat Party. Mr. Chairman. That is unacceptable. and to come to the floor today and tell us and the American people that they are here to protect it just isnt true. We are on the course to a fiscal calamity. and if that happens. who are the people who are hurt the most among us? The people who are hurt the worst are the poorest. the ones who are most in need of government assistance. We should look to our churches and to our communities for that help. but there is a role for government. If you have a debt crisis. if you have a fiscal crisis. and if you have people who have a hard time heating their homes or putting food on their tables or who have kids who want to go to college or if you want to build roads and bridges. there is not money there for those projects. If you want to be able to invest in your future. you have to make sure you have a budget that is sustainable. When you pay $230 billion in interest alone today. when the Fed is printing money to buy down that interest rate and when the President says. in 10 years. interest on the debt is going to be $880 billionyou can build a lot of roads. bridges. feed a lot of people. and send a lot of kids to school for almost $1 trillion a year. Lets fix this problem. Lets work together. Lets balance our budget. It starts right here in the House with the Budget Committee.
1130120132,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentleman from Idaho for yielding. and I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his kind remarks about my ads. which I know there werent many positive ads in the Duluth market. but I did have one. So I appreciate that. Mr. NOLAN. and thank you for your support of what is a very important bill for folks in northern Wisconsin. I have a picture of what this actual lighthouse looks like right off the community of Ashland. This bill. H.R. 4049. is the bill that will transfer the Ashland Breakwater Light from the Coast Guard to the National Park Service. This lighthouse has stood here for over 100 years. standing strong on the shores of Lake Superior in dark nights and in storms. guarding our ships in their safe passage to our harbor. but also welcoming back travelers who have left the greater Ashland community and on the way home. I had a chance to live in Ashland for 10 years. raising my children. My secondborn son was born there. I think my third. fourth. and fifth were born there as well. I lose count after a while. but it is a great community. This lighthouse is a big part of our identity in Ashland. Right now. the lighthouse has an uncertain future because the Coast Guard has indicated several times. most recently in 2012. that they are going to give up management of the lighthouse. No public entity. aside from the National Park Services Apostle Islands National Lakeshore have stepped forward and indicated that they would obtain and maintain this very important lighthouse in our community. Absent this legislation. there is no guarantee that this historic lighthouse would be maintained and continue to operate and be accessible for educational purposes. H.R. 4049 will allow the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore to maintain the lighthouse alongside. as Mr. NOLAN and I think Mr. LAB RADOR mentioned. eight other lighthouses they maintain. Just a little trip down history lane: in 1986. the Coast Guard transferred eight of these lighthouses to the National Park Service. but they didnt transfer this one. All we are doing right now is saying lets redraw that line and include this one with the other eight. so the National Park Service can now manage this lighthouse as well. If I were looking at this bill. I might say. ""Well. I have a concern if I am a fisherman or a boater who might use the waters outside the lighthouse."" I can guarantee you that the way this is written and the way the line is drawn there will be no additional rules or regulations coming from the Feds that are going to affect your ability to fish or boat right around the lighthouse. We have adequately addressed that concern in this House by having so many different folks come together. people across the aisle who share a border and a lake. but also share a love for the environment and all it has to offer. We also have support of the National Park Service who supports this bill. the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. the U.S. Coast Guard. the Wisconsin DNR. the Wisconsin Historical Society. the Ashland Chamber of Commerce. which is very important. the city of Ashland. and a lot of local outdoor recreational communities. With that. I would urge passage of H.R. 4049. and I want to thank everyone for their support for what is a very important bill to my community in northern Wisconsin."

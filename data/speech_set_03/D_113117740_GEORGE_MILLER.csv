1130000072,I thank the gentlewoman for this recognition. and I rise in favor of the motion to commit that I will be offering with Mr. CLYBURN and Mr. LEWIS before the House later today so that we can take a small. but very important. step to protect the right of every American to vote. I was appalled on this past election day by widespread reports across the country of voters forced to wait in hourslong lines simply to exercise one of our most fundamental rightsthe right to vote. Even in some States with early voting. voters were forced to choose between waiting for hours or missing work or taking care of their children in order to cast their vote. or giving up their right to vote altogether. At some precincts in Miami. hundreds of voters stood in line for over 4 hours. past the 7 oclock closing time of the polls. even after President Obama had been declared the winner of the election. It offends our basic values that Americans would be denied the right to vote because of a lastminute illness or change in the work schedule. the need to pick up a child from school. or some other unavoidable emergency. meaning that they could not afford to wait in line for several hours simply to exercise that right. The motion to commit in the House will make two important changes. First. it will require in Federal elections that every State provide for at least 15 days early voting. and. two. it would require the State to provide adequate resources. staff. and machines at polling places in Federal elections to ensure that voters are not forced to wait in line for more than an hour. There are numerous changes that need to be made to adequately protect the rights of all Americans to their right to vote. and I support the comprehensive approach to voter protections that has been developed by Mr. LEWIS and Mr. CLYBURN. However. today we have a chance to take a very simple step to make sure that voting is simple for Americans so they can exercise their right. a right that we broadcast to the rest of the world about how we choose our leaders and how we exercise our democracy. But that right and that democracy is now being thwarted by efforts at the local and State levels to make voting more difficult. to prohibit people from voting. We can change all of that in the motion to commit today in this rules package. and I would urge my colleagues to support that. I want to thank Mr. CLYBURN and Mr. LEWIS for their leadership. Im very sorry that Mr. LEWIS is unable to be here today with the untimely death of his wife. Lillian.
1130005667,I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. and I rise in support of House Resolution 77. And I commend the chair of the committee and the ranking member for bringing this to the floor. and I hope that all of our colleagues will participate in this competition for students in STEM subjects to create these apps and to further. hopefully. their careers in STEM. But I must tell you. Mr. Speaker. I am also deeply worried that our hopes to increase the number of students who will participate in STEM education and become part of the STEM careers that are available to them that this Nation so desperately needs could all be for naught. this resolution and all of our efforts. if on Friday we are not able to set aside the sequester and make a balanced proposal to reduce the deficit and to provide for the ongoing needs of this Nation. Right now. if we do nothing between now and Friday. there will be a $740 million cut to title I. impacting over 1 million students. lowincome students. and 9.000 teachers and staff jobs. Those are the people that we want to encourage to go into STEM. Those are the very same students that have a 1 in 7 chance of having a qualified teacher teach them mathematics or science in their schools. So the very population that youre trying to encourage will have less of a chance because of sequestration. Over $600 million cuts for students with disabilities. eliminating some 7.800 teacher and staff jobs with respect to those students. For those students who are trying to acquire the English language so they can participate in STEM careers and STEM academics. nearly 210.000 children and 450 teachers would be eliminated by the sequestration. And the same goes with community learning centers. where its an opportunity to expose these students. after school and in additional time. to these careers. to these opportunities. to the applications and to the Web sites that are available to them that they cant use during class time. But. finally. there is even a more direct harm that will be done by sequestration. and that is that the National Science Foundation would issue nearly 1.000 fewer research grants and awards. impacting an estimated 12.000 scientists and students and curtailing critical scientific research. Thats the scientific research that builds this Nation. And for that reason. I ask unanimous consent that the House now take up H.R. 699. a balanced approach introduced by Mr. VAN HOLLEN. to replace the sequestration and save jobs and avoid these cuts in education that are so desperately needed.
1130021249,Mr. Speaker. little more than 100 years ago. a New York State assemblyman was an eyewitness to one of our Nations worst industrial tragediesthe Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire. He recounted how he saw girl after girl appear in the reddened windows. pause for a terrified moment. and then leap to the pavement below. to land as a mangled. bloody pulp. He said it went on for what seemed like a ghastly eternity. and described how the firemens life nets were torn by the impact of falling bodies. This inferno at a sweatshop garment factory in New York City employed mostly poor. immigrant women. One hundred fortysix workers died that day because it lacked proper stairways. fire escapes. and managers had locked all of the exits. This tragedy shook our Nation and led to lifesaving workplace safety reforms. A century later. I recently met a young Bangladeshi garment worker named Sumi. She. too. jumped from a window of the Tazreen garment factory. She survived. but 12 of her coworkers who jumped with her did not. More than 100 others who never had the opportunity to jump were found inside of the factory dead. This haunting tragedy has many parallels to the Triangle fire: exit doors were locked. fire extinguishers were not working. fire codes went unenforced. We dont tolerate those workplace conditions in the United States anymore. but those are deadly conditions that are tolerated in other countries that make the clothing that we wear. These tragedies have moved from New York to Bangladesh. driven by the business models and global supply chains of the worlds leading retailers and clothing brands. But now Bangladesh has had what might be its own Triangle Shirtwaist fire. On April 24. more than 1.100 people died as Rana Plaza and its garment factories collapsed. Some 2.000 more were injured. and rescuers are still pulling bodies out 3 weeks later. There have been an additional 40 fires. explosions. and other incidents between the Tazreen fire and the Rana Plaza tragedies. Its simply a matter of time before there is another one. These incidents shocked people around the globe and laid bare the need for bold action. The lives of 4 million workers in these factories are counting on bold action. But not everyone has been shocked. Major American retailers and clothing brands have refused to change the way they conduct business in Bangladesh. the second largest garment producer in the world after China. They are hoping instead that the heightened attention will pass without having to change their business model. That business model pits sweatshop against sweatshop. country against country. in a race to the bottom to rake in billions of dollars in profits while paying as little as 22 cents per shirt. In Bangladesh. American and international companies flourish in this system. companies we all know like Walmart. the Gap. JCPenney. and The Childrens Place. just to name a few. They refuse to accept responsibility. So what can be done to improve the Bangladeshi factory safety? Certainly there are things local government can do: address corruption that allows unsafe. dangerous structures. enforce safety codes. defend the right of workers to form unions and to have workers be able to refuse unsafe work. The Bangladeshi Government is scrambling to implement limited reforms. hoping to keep the industry that is critical to its economy. but only the retailers and brands can put a floor under this race to the bottom. The economic power rests with them. That is why the announcement this week by major European companies and one American company that they have signed a binding and enforceable fire and building safety agreement for Bangladesh factories is so significant. H&M. Zara. Primark. and C&A are to be applauded for their unprecedented and bold steps. They have been joined by only one American company. PhillipsVan Heusen. which has Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger among its brands. and one major German retailer. But now El Corte Ingles. Marks & Spencer. Mango. and Benetton have also agreed to sign this enforceable agreement. The agreement provides for independent safety inspections with public reports. mandatory repairs and renovations. money to fund the necessary safety upgrades. the right of workers to refuse unsafe work. and the vital role of workers and unions. This agreement is truly unprecedented. But where are the other American companies? Where are the American retailers? Where are the American clothing brands? Where is Walmart? Where is JCPenney? Where is the Gap? Where is The Childrens Place? Their silence in the face of this tragedy is inexcusable. They should sign the binding safety agreement to protect Bangladeshi workers. They should sign it now. Experts estimate safety improvements under this plan would cost about a dime a garment. A dime for the life of these women. I urge all Americans to join in demanding that the American retailers and fashion brands stop selling their bloodstained labels and sign the enforceable agreement to protect these Bangladeshi women.
1130024456,I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her work on this rule last night in the committee. It has already been said that. in a little more than a month. the interest rates on loans for millions of the neediest students will double to 6.8 percent from the current 3.4 percent. This morning. unfortunately. the Republican majority has put forth a bill that is even worse than if the Congress does nothing. Think about it. If Congress does nothing. the interest rates go from 3.4 percent for those most in need of the student loans. for those families most in need to finance their educations. and will jump on July 1 to 6.8 percent. Were trying to avoid that because we know what that means to students who have to borrow money and families who have to borrow money to try to pay for their college educations. Whats the remedy of the Republicans? The remedy of the Republicans is to do something that is worse than letting the interest rates double. Understand that. Theyve made a choice thats worse than if the interest rates double. Its no wonder that. beyond the Republican caucus. its very hard to find anybody who is supporting this legislation. In fact. yesterday. the President said. if this bill is sent to his deskI hope it will not bethat he will veto it. Why would we do that? Because its very clear that this is going to add $4 billion to the debt of our students who Members of Congress lament are so deeply in debt because of the money they have to borrow that goes to education. Its not necessarily a choice for students or families if you want to get a college education. but why would you add $4 billion onto the backs of these students and their families? Now. the majority had a number of alternatives last night in the Rules Committee. Mr. COURTNEY went there and said. Well pay for it. Well raise additional revenues to keep it at 3.4 percent. Then the Education and the Workforce Committee of this House can do its job. which is to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. and we can put in place a longterm program for helping families finance their educations. We have to also understand that weve got to do something about the State support and the cost of college at the institutional level. but they turned Mr. COURTNEY down.
1130038862,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a fundamental debate that we will be having now as we enter the amendment process for this legislation. This is really a debate about whether we go backwards or forwards as a Nation. Every Member of this CongressI believe I would be correct in sayingboth in the House and the Senatehas told their constituents how important it is that we have a worldclass education system and how we are falling behind other nations. Yet we see here the consideration of legislation by this Chamber that. in fact. moves us to the past. It restricts the resources that are available. It reduces the accountability in the system. It fails to support teachers and principalsthose people who almost every speaker today has said are the most important people in our education system. While it provides for teacher evaluation. which I support. it really only provides it for the purposes of hiring and firing a teacher. not to provide the kind of support and not to provide the kind of collaboration that teachersyoung teachers and new teachers to the systembring with them in wanting to have that experience so they can improve their profession. the kinds of opportunities that teachers want. and the reason teachers are organizing independently among themselves. both on the Internet and in localities. so that they can share their skills and their talents to improve their abilities to deliver the education. That support is not here. You can say. Well. its blockgranted. and they can do it if they want. Not under sequestration. Theyll be lucky if they can provide survival for the students whom this legislation is directed at. which are the poorest children in this countryminority children. English learners. children on Indian reservations. children who need special attention to succeed. If they get it. they can succeed. but this legislation doesnt do that. This legislation doesnt address the priority that. again. every Member in this body has spoken about. As for the priority that needs to be put on STEM. you can do it if you want to do it. Ive listened for so many yearspeople say. within the Federal Government. its only 5 percent of the money or its only 6 percent of the moneyand its always so burdensome. Well then. dont take it. I know the managers amendment says that. but thats the law today. You sign up for this. And if everything else is going so well. how does this 5 percent of the money have such bad results in the districts? Because the fact of the matter is. we know. for whatever reason. many. many school districts and many schools are failing the students that theyre supposed to be teaching. This is an effort to try to assist them. This is an effort to try to give them the flexibility so that they can make these decisions. but if you send it in the form of H.R. 5. theyre not going to have the support to do it. theyre not going to have the resources to do it. theyre not going to have the trained teachers to do it. theyre not going to have the trained principals to do itand thats what we should not be doing. We should. in fact. be emboldening our schools with those resources. with those talents and with those skills. We should make sure that every teacher has the capability. has the subject matter competency. In a poor school today. youre learning arithmetic in the fourth grade. youre learning mathematics in the eighth grade. youre learning algebrayour chances of having a teacher who understands those subjects and who has taken courses in those subjects is one in seven. Shouldnt it be. for those children. one in one? Shouldnt it be that every classroom has a teacher who has subject matter competency? But we all know in our districts that thats not what happens in many of these schools. We know that. in fact. an art teacher is asked to go into a mathematics class. We know that a parttime history teacher is asked. Can you help us out in the science class? Thats not how you maintain this countrys being number one in the Nation. Thats not the education system that will do it. We can poke along. and we can lament. and we can worry about China and India and about countries that are making a commitment to their education systems and to their research facilities. but unless we make that commitment. we wont be running that race in the next generation. We will have settled in to some other place than number one. and I dont think thats acceptable to the people of this country. We have been told by all business leaders who come herewhether they come from Silicon Valley or they come from the manufacturing areas of the country in the Midwestthat they want a stronger K through 12 system. Thats why the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable have serious problems and are in opposition to H.R. 5. because it doesnt meet their needs that they say that they need in terms of a future educated population in order to get those skilled workers. to get that talent base. to get that future innovation. Thats their decision. not my decision. Thats also the decision of the civil rights groups. Thats also the decision of the parents with children with disabilities and of the disabilities community. Thats also the decision of the educators in these systems. This legislation is not up to the standards of America. It doesnt meet Americas future needs. It doesnt meet the standards of excellence. and it doesnt meet the commitment of resources that this Nation should be making on behalf of the schoolchildren in this Nation and of future generations. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130039350,Mr. Chairman. this amendment is not about a good education. This is an amendment suggesting an approach that in fact the amendment doesnt enable to happen. and that is the idea that a student can choose the school under the guise of portability. when in fact it doesnt set up any mechanisms for the students to do that. The suggestion here somehow is that. in fact. the students will make this choice or the parents will make this choice. Weve had the right under No Child Left Behind for students to make the choice to elect to go to any schools in the district in which they sought to do that. Of course. what we found out. in many instances. its less than 2 to 3 percent of the parents who make that decision. There are many reasons why they dont do that. In fact. its a decision that it doesnt work for them because of lack of transportation in poor neighbors. lack of issues of personal safety of the students. The difference in my district. in some parts of my district of going to the school thats next to your home or walking the six or eight or 10 blocks to where the next school is. its a matter of personal safety for those children. We have children. unfortunately. who are harmed every day on our streets. in some cases killed on those streets. So for parents. this isnt just a choice. that its a better school. Also under the Cantor amendment. you would be requiring school districts to engage in an entirely complex accounting system. and I dont know why wed burden them with that. We currently have in many. many districts open enrollment. And as I say. parents can choose that if they want. but in many cases they cant because of barriers to that enrollment. So this is a suggestion somehow that you can just pick up and move your child. What we see in survey after survey after survey is what parents want. and they want their neighborhood school. the school next to them. they want that school to be functioning at a high level so that their child. their children. can get an education at that school. I know that maybe the author of this amendment isnt familiar with these parents. that these parents are struggling between their jobs. their work. holding their families together. Very often its individual working women supporting these families. This is a difficult task. And the idea that the burden wont be on the district to improve that local school. but well just leave it be under the guise that parents can opt to send their children somewhere else when. in fact. thats not a real option for them. This amendment doesnt address the concern about open enrollment. it doesnt address the systems that the States have set up. and it clearly doesnt address the needs of the parents. And it fails to recognize that in many school districts. theres only one school. theres only one middle school. theres only two elementary schools. Thats not the issue here. This isnt like a panoply of wide choices that are made available. Thats why many of us have encouraged charter schools inside these districts so parents will have that choice that is within reach of them. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130042945,I have no further speakers. Mr. Speaker. in closing. I want to thank the chair of the committee for bringing this bill to the floor as soon as it was possible to do. but certainly before we break for August. This legislation. as I said earlier. is a vast improvement over what we voted on before and what was presented to this House. I think families all across the country with students heading off to college or returning to college this fall will be happy to know that as they take out a student loan this year. they will save over the next 5 years some $25 billion because those loans that they take out will have that interest rate guaranteed at that rate today and for the life of that loan. Big distinction between this bill and the bill that was presented for the House to vote on. which many of us rejected but the Republicans supported and was passed to the Senate. Over the next 10 years. it provides about $4 billion in additional relief. Whats important to know is that this will deal with making college more affordable. But. clearly. what is on the agenda of the Education and Workforce Committee is making sure that were dealing with the cost of college so that we can reduce the student debt in this country. we can reduce the affordability of college in this country. We expect that as we struggle to try to figure out how to provide this loan money on behalf of the taxpayers to these students who are the future of our economy. the future of our society. that the institutions will struggle with seeing what they can do to lower the cost of these colleges. This is a very exciting time in postsecondary education because we have opportunities now with technologies and the ability to present classes in new formats. in new forums for students much differently than in the past. Weve got to make sure that were providing that quality education. but perhaps in a way thats more cost efficient. And efficiency isnt the enemy of intellectual curiosity or intellectual achievement or scholastic achievement. but it may be helpful to those families who are struggling with a debt to provide one. two. or three children a college education. or for those students who graduated who are struggling with that debt as they enter the job market. So we really want to say that weve done the best we can under these circumstances with this legislation. but we expect the institutions of higher education all across this country to reexamine how theyre doing their business and what they can do to reduce the cost of college. And well continue to do our part. trying to make it more affordable for the American family. But in the past. weve seen where we put money in at the top and the States took the money out at the bottom. Were not going to play that game anymore. and we cant play that game anymore. That has ended up with a lot of increased debt on the part of students. Certainly with respect to the public institutions. the States have to step up and share the responsibility for their public institutions. We cannot have this situation where they continue to decline their support and then foster that off on parents and students. and then the parents and students need help from the Federal Government. That chain has got to stop here. But I think today. this is a big and important step in terms of the affordability of college for students. And all of the indicators are that that college degree is well worth it over the lifetime of work of students. over the types of jobs that they will get. the types of wages that they will receive. Its still a huge benefit. There has been a lot of discussion over the last few months that maybe college isnt worth it anymore. It is. but we have to do it right. And young people have to be able to obtain that college education. and they have to do it with the least amount of debt possible. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130045082,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of S. 256. This legislation includes provisions adjusting the minimum wage schedule for the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands in a way that I think is appropriate and fair for both workers and businesses there. Current law requires CNMI to increase its minimum wage 50 cents a year until it reaches the Mainlands federal minimum wage level of $7.25. Current law also requires the GAO to regularly report to Congress on economic conditions in Commonwealth over the course of these minimum wage adjustments. These GAO reports are intended to give the public information so that. based on sound economic analysis. Congress can adjust the minimum wage schedule for the territories if warranted. The next GAO report is due in April of 2014. Since 2007 the Commonwealths minimum wage has increased from $3.05 an hour to $5.55 an hour. an 82% increase in the past 5 years. This has brought new purchasing power and a higher standard of living for many workers than they could have negotiated on their own. This bill would skip an increase in the minimum wage in CNMI for 2013 and 2015. while still requiring increases in 2014. 2016 and subsequent years. This approach was recommended by the Saipan Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber stated in a May 8th letter that given the fragile economy in CNMI ""spreading the wage jumps over a twoyear period seems prudent."" This legislation is also recommended by Congressman SABLAN. a tireless advocate for workers and for improving the Commonwealths economy. Because CNMIs wages had been depressed for so long. it is a long march of nearly a decade to more than double their minimum wage. In a territory like CNMI. we have recognized that we would need to be flexible with the wage rate schedule over that time frame. as conditions warranted. Todays bill reflects that need for flexibility. It allows us to review the next GAO economic analysis for CNMI before another wage increase takes effect. Because of CNMIs unique economic circumstances and relatively undiversified economy. it is appropriate for Congress to adjust the minimum wage schedule in response to changing economic conditions. while keeping our longterm commitment to reaching parity with the federal minimum wage. I urge my colleagues to support S. 256."
1130058243,"I thank the ranking member for all of her work on this legislation and for her yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2374. This bill is very bad news for working families. It protects the loophole in the law that allows conflicted brokers and advisers to rip off ordinary Americans who are trying to save for their retirements. The 2008 financial crisis wiped out trillions of dollars of Americans retirement accounts. Working families now need help in rebuilding those nest eggs. and they need better protection for their savings. The SEC and the Labor Department have moved to provide these protections. proposing to close the harmful loophole. but this bill would scuttle those efforts. Here is what is at stake. Millions of Americans are putting money aside every day in their 401(k)s and in their IRAs to save for retirement. They have to make these investment choices. and Wall Street is more than happy to advise. but some of those advisers and brokers have conflicts of interest. often undisclosed conflicts of interest. The brokers know about their conflicts of interest. and the brokerage houses know about their conflicts of interest. but the person who is handing over his hardearned retirement funds doesnt know about the conflicts of interest. The workers think they can trust this investment advice. But what they dont know is that their advisers may get paid more for. in fact. in actual cases. steering them into highcost funds with the worst performing of the family of funds. It is very good for the family of funds. but it is very bad for that individual worker who is now handing over his retirement nest egg. That product might have higher fees than other products. It might underperform compared to other products. In other words. the product is not in the workers best interest. but it certainly is in the brokers best interest. The SEC and the Labor Department are trying to close this loophole that allows this ripoff to continue to happen. and it is. indeed. a ripoff of ordinary Americans. I know my friend from New Jersey doesnt like the term ""ripoff."" but that is what is happening to these hardworking American families. Multiple studiesnot conjecturehave found that these conflicts of interest cost these retirees. these workers. very real money. In 2009. the GAO found that. when a pension consultant has conflicts of interest. a defined benefit retirement plan underperforms by 130 basis points. If a conflicted broker in the defined contribution world recommends funds at a similar rate of underperformance. a 40yearold worker who rolls over his $20.000 401(k) balance into an IRA will see his retirement savings cut by a third over 30 years. If he normally earns 6 percent returns. he would now only be making a 4.7 percent return. The bottom line is he is $35.000 poorer by the time he reaches 70. Thank you for that conflicted advice. This year. researchers found that the funds recommended by conflicted brokers in 401(k) plans underperformed by an average of 3.6 percent. That translates into workers losing $1 billion every month from their retirement funds because of these conflicts of interest. As a result. consumers are getting bad advice and are putting their retirement savings at stake. Where do those figures come from? They come from the founders of the Vanguard funds. who worked out the differences between these funds. conflicted funds. and other funds. That is why the DoddFrank law directs the SEC to transition brokers to a fiduciary standard. and. separately. the Department of Labor is trying to align the protections as well. Brokers need to either act solely in the best interests of investors or otherwise disclose who they work for and how they are paid. but some on Wall Street have cried out. claiming that they will not be able to offer investment advice. especially to working people. if they cannot offer conflicted advice. They cant tell you how to invest your money unless they can offer you conflicted advice wherein they are getting paid more to offer you a substandard product. With the knowledge of that and the higher fees. they somehow cant make money. Lets remember that 75 percent of the brokers cant beat the S&P 500 that is on automatic pilot."

1130028316,Thank you. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Thank you for yielding and leading us here tonight. Im glad to join you here from this side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker. religious freedom is our first freedom. as stated right there in the First Amendment. This is not just freedom to worship as we hear it defined now in many ways. It is not just freedom to worship in our own homes. in our churches. synagogues. mosques. temples. It is freedom to practice and live out religious faith here in America. On June 21 through July 4. the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is having a Fortnight for Freedom to pray. educate. and act for religious freedom. But this is not just a Catholic issue. This is an issue for all Americans. Its an American issue. Just as you said this is not just a Republican issue. Freedom is what our country was founded on. We just recently commemorated Memorial Day for all of those who have died for our country and for freedom. Friday is Flag Day. Again. well be remembering what America is all about in our freedom. And on the Fourth of July. we celebrate the freedom that our country was born to serve and to live out and be a beacon for the rest of the world. We need to uphold that freedom. and the HHS mandate. amongst other efforts. other things that have been done by the Federal Government. unfortunately. in recent years has really run counter to freedom. Mr. Speaker. I want Americans to understand what this is about. Its not about birth control or abortion. although we were told in the health care law. ObamaCare was not going to cover abortion. though we know the HHS mandate requires the abortioninducing drugs. But thats not what the core of this is about. Its about freedom. Its about taking away Americans freedom. requiring them to participate in activities that violate their conscience. Unfortunately. I think theres been a lot of misdirection on this. and I think its important for all of us to focus back on what this is about. Its about freedom for all Americans to live their lives according to their conscience. whether or not they are practicing faith or not. Its to live according to their conscience. So. Mr. Speaker. I just am very happy to join with my colleagues in helping to support. protect and call upon Americans to speak up. rise up and bring that message to Congress. to their Representatives. that freedom must be protected. We must do it now. We cannot continue to let freedom slip away. And Im very happy to join my colleagues tonight.
1130057331,Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman from West Virginia for yielding. I rise today in strong support and as a cosponsor of WRRDA. This bill shows that the T&I Committee is working together. finding areas of agreement. building consensus. and. yes. compromising in order to get things done for the American people. I thank Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member RAHALL for demonstrating how Congress should operate in constructing a bill that rebuilds America and creates jobs. Earlier this year. Congressman WHITFIELD and I issued H.R. 1149 to fix our inland waterways. and WRRDA incorporates a number of WAVE 4 provisions. including project delivery process reforms. project prioritization. development of a 20year capital investment plan. and Olmsted project reform. In addition. this bill contains important provisions to stop the movement of Asian carp to the Great Lakes. and I urge support of Representative MCCOLLUMs amendment that I am cosponsoring which would strengthen these provisions. With that. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Id like to begin by commending Chairmen SHUSTER and GIBBS and Ranking Members RAHALL and BISHOP for their efforts on H.R. 3080. the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA). As a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. and as a cosponsor. I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation. Its important to recognize that in the current political climate. the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is working together to find areas of agreement. build consensus. and yes. compromise in order to get things done on behalf of the American people. This is exactly what they sent us here to do. its what they expect this Congress to do. Todays Big Four agreement exemplifies this commitment to working together. And it is indicative of Chairman SHUSTERS and Ranking Member RAHALLS leadership style on the Committee. Im hopeful that we will continue to work in a bipartisan manner as we turn to the rail and highways & transit reauthorizations in the future. Id like to thank the Big Four for working with me to include several important provisions in this legislation. including language to deauthorize Dime Pier in Chicago. IL and deauthorize LucasBerg Pit in Worth. IL. Dime Pier. which is located just south of Navy Pier in Chicago. is almost 100 years old and is no longer used for the purposes of navigation. WRRDA would formally deauthorize the pier. effectively allowing the City to redevelop that area of the lakefront. LucasBerg Pit is a former gravel pit. located in my district. acquired by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago and designated by the Army Corps in the 1970s as a site for the placement of dredged materials from the CalSag Channel. For a variety of reasons. including its proximity to the community. the site simply isnt suitable for the placement of these materials. WRRDA recognizes this reality and deauthorizes the use of the site. Im also pleased that WRRDA contains a number of provisions included in H.R. 1149. the Waterways Are Vital for the Economy. Energy. Efficiency. and Environment Act of 2013 (WAVE4). which Mr. WHITFIELD and I introduced earlier this year. In particular. Title II of WRRDA includes project delivery process reforms. project prioritization. the development of a 20year Corps capital investment plan with the Inland Waterways Users Board. and a modification to the cost sharing requirement on the Olmsted Lock and Dam projectitems all addressed by WAVE4. The Olmsted Lock and Dam cost sharing modification provision. Section 216 of the bill. is especially important. Unfortunately. Olmsted is significantly over budget and behind schedule. currently consuming most of the revenue out of the Inland Waterway Trust Fund. This has prevented virtually any other major project in the system from moving forward. Section 216 of the bill increases the federal share of the project. thus allowing more revenue in the Trust Fund to flow to other projects while Olmsted moves to completion. I would also like to thank Ms. MCCOLLUM for offering an amendmentwhich I am cosponsoringto prevent the spread of Asian carp. The Great Lakes provide an estimated 7 billion dollars of fishing activity to the region each year. activity that would be damaged by the spread of Asian carp. We must take immediate action to preserve the Great Lakes environment and all of the economic activityfrom fishing and recreation to shipping and transportationthat helps make the Midwest economy strong. Under this amendment. federal agencies would partner with state and local governments to provide expertise and advice on best practices for eliminating Asian carp through activities like contract fishing and pesticide application. While this bill is critically important. like all legislation it is not perfect. For example. one important provision currently not included in the legislation is the increased revenue necessary for the Inland Waterway Trust Fund. Given the legitimate needs and the condition of the network. industry is supportive of a userfee increase. My legislation. WAVE 4. proposes a 6 centspergallon increase. and I am hopeful Congress can address this issue in the coming months. I would like to close by again thanking Chairmen SHUSTER and GIBBS and Ranking Members RAHALL and BISHOP for their hard work on WRRDA this year. This bill is based on compromise and collaboration. and accordingly I urge my colleagues to support it.
1130081350,"I thank Mrs. HARTZLER for yielding and for her leadership on this critical issue. which is not just as partisan issue. I am a Democrat. I know this is not a partisan issuereligious liberty. This is not even just a foundational American principle. It is a fundamental human right. Many of the men and women who came to America were fleeing religious persecution and were searching for a place where they could freely exercise their faiths. They had the courage to pledge their lives. fortunes. and sacred honor to the cause. As a number of my colleagues have stated. the First Amendment to our Constitution starts with these words: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" I used to teach my American Government students that. clearly. this was not freedom to worshipjust the freedom to go on Sunday or Saturday or whatever day of the week that you worshipedbut a freedom to exercise religion in the way they see proper. As First Lady Michelle Obama stated at a conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. our faith journey isnt just about showing up on Sunday. it is about what we do Monday through Saturday as well. That is what Americans believe. and we must protect the freedom to exercise our religious beliefs every day of the week. Many millions have had the courage to fight. and many have died to protect our Nation in this constitutional right. We all have a duty to our fellow Americans and to the world to reclaim a true religious liberty in our Nation because this goes beyond our borders. America has been a beacon of liberty for people around the world for more than two centuries. As people blessed with liberty. we have a special obligation to protect it and to proclaim it for all the world to see. Especially today. as we see around the world attacks on religious freedom. we must stand up here in America. I want to thank all of my colleagues for standing up here today and for continuing to work in Congress to protect our religious freedom. and I want to pray for wisdom for our Supreme Court Justices tomorrow as they consider this very critical. fundamental case. We all must rededicate ourselves and continue to fight for religious freedom in our Nation. without which freedom we would be giving up on a fundamental principle that underlies this greatest of nations."
1130084344,"Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for the courtesy of yielding. especially today as I rise in support of H.R. 2575. I was first approached about the problem with the 30hour full time definition by Steve Palmer. one of the owners of Palmer Place restaurant. an institution in LaGrange. Illinois. This is a family business committed to their community and their employees. They offer insurance coverage to their workers when possible. Because of the nature of the business. many of their employees are parttime and work flexible schedules. But the ACAs definition of fulltime work has put the Palmer faiilys one restaurant on the cusp of being classified as a large business. The family. thus. finds itself facing a hefty new expense for health insurance or a fine. This is the scenario being faced by many familyowned businesses struggling to plan for the future. The workers at some of these businesses are about to get a far different deal than they bargained for when they accepted their jobs. As a result of the 30hour rule. some parttime employees are seeing their hours reduced. The CBO has confirmed that shifting to a 40hour full time definition would lead some workers to seeing an increase in their takehome pay. In addition to lost wages. many workers could lose scheduling flexibility so that they wont cycle in and out of fulltime status from week to week. These are ways that workers will lose. The administration has already acknowledged the difficulty in implementing the employer coverage rules of the ACA through two delays in substantial administrative changes. Clearly. the administration knows there are problems with the employer coverage rules as currently contained in the law. Today. it is reported that former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said: ""I dont think the employer mandate will go into effect."" Madam Speaker. lets do right by Americas parttime workers and by family businesses. Lets pass this bill and fix this broken part of the ACA. That is what the American people are looking for. That is what we should do."
1130106105,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1786. legislation that would reauthorize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. or NWIRP. As an Illinoisan. I know firsthand that windstorms are a threat to American lives and the economy. Last November. Illinois was struck by 24 tornadoes on one day. resulting in seven fatalities. hundreds of injuries. and significant economic damage. While we cannot stop a hurricane or tornado from happening. there is much we can do to save both lives and property when windstorms and other natural disasters happen. In addition to responding quickly and with sufficient resources in the aftermath of a natural disaster. we must also invest in preparedness and resilience. Studies of FEMAs predisaster mitigation program have shown that for every dollar we invest in mitigation activities. we save $3 to $4 in recovery costs. NWIRP is primarily a mitigation program. It has the potential to lessen the loss of life and economic damage by supporting research and development on windstorms and their impacts and helping to ensure that this research is translated into improved building codes and emergency plans. But NWIRP needs investments to reach that potential. I was pleased that when this bill was considered in the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. we worked in a bipartisan manner to make several improvements to this bill. I want to thank my colleagues. Chairman SMITH and Mr. NEUGEBAUER. for working across the aisle in a smooth and productive process. We worked together to increase the authorization for FEMA. the NWIRP agency tasked with translating the research conducted at other agencies into effective mitigation tools and techniques and helping communities across the Nation implement mitigation measures through outreach and partnership. In addition. we worked together to add language to the bill addressing human factors in reducing windstorm impacts. This is not just a building engineering problem. it is also a social science and human response problem. People in the path of a windstorm have to make smart decisions. no matter what structure they are in. In order to design effective strategies to prepare for. respond to. and recover from a disaster. we must take into account research in how people make decisions and respond to warnings during natural disasters. We must also understand how different groups of people may respond differently so that we can tailor outreach and warnings appropriately. I was pleased we were able to strengthen the legislation by adding this important language on human factors. Often. in a compromise like this one. you do not get everything you would like. I would have liked to see increases in the authorization levels across the board. This bill includes a lower total authorization level than what was authorized for this program in fiscal year 2008. Nevertheless. I understand the need to reauthorize this important program. Finally. I want to thank my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. which I also serve on. for working with us on this bill since we share jurisdiction over this program. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1130106128,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. The U.S. has a great tradition of using science diplomacy to strengthen our ties with allies and to open the door to building better relationships across the globe. That is why I introduced H.R. 5029. the International Science and Technology Cooperation Act of 2014. Scientific issues know no boundaries and deal with problems and opportunities of the highest importance to the entire world. Improvements in such areas as energy security. infectious diseases. space exploration. telecommunications and the Internet. and many more are due. in part. to international cooperationto the benefit of all nations involved. By collaborating with international partners on science. we strengthen the U.S. scientific enterprise. which helps us get the best return on our research investment. This bipartisan bill would improve international science cooperation by requiring the National Science and Technology Council at the White House to maintain a body that would identify and coordinate U.S. interagency strategy for international science and technology cooperation. Many Federal agencies already work with international counterparts on science and technological issues. but until recently. there was no coordinating body to identify new partnerships and to fully leverage existing collaborations. While the administration is taking steps to formulate a strategy for international science cooperation. this bill will ensure that the process moves forward with the appropriate congressional oversight. which is something I think we can all agree on. The U.S. scientific enterprise is admired across the world. In addition to helping our own researchers solve problems of national and global importance more efficiently. international cooperation helps to demonstrate the value of the free flow of ideas. which is the foundation of American democracy. There is one other thing I wanted to raise. If anyone has any questions about the importance of collaboration when it comes to scientific endeavors. I certainly recommend the documentary ""Particle Fever."" which is about the work at CERN. in Switzerland. on the Large Hadron Collider. As a physicist searches for the Higgs bosonit sounds like it would be an incredibly boring documentary to watch. but it is just fascinating to see and to see the international cooperation that goes on as they do this search. It is a great example of what international collaboration can do in the scientific enterprise. I want to thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member JOHNSON for working with me to improve the bill we have before us and to bring it to the floor. When this bill was considered in the 111th Congress. it passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. I am hopeful that we will pass it again today and see action in the Senate as well. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130106220,"Mr. Speaker. today. I stand to ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3085. a bill I introduced to rename Chicagos Mount Greenwood Post Office at 3349 West 111th Street in honor of Chicago Fire Captain Herbert ""Herbie"" Johnson. Captain Johnson died 2 years ago at the age of 54. while fighting a house fire on Chicagos South Side. Captain Johnson heroically served in the Chicago Fire Department for over 32 years. He learned public service from his family. Three of his brothers are Chicago police officers. A sister is a retired Chicago police officer. Another brother is a Chicago firefighter. So his family knows the danger of being a first responder. Captain Johnson served in almost every Chicago neighborhood as a firefighter. but his heart belonged to the southwest side. especially to the closeknit community of Mount Greenwood. Over the years. Captain Johnson taught over 1.000 recruits as an instructor at the Robert J. Quinn Fire Academy. He is fondly remembered by those he taught. After the horrible terrorist attacks of 9111. Herbert Johnson went to New York City to volunteer with the rescue efforts. In 2007. he was awarded the States highest honor for firefighters. the Illinois Medal of Honor. for rescuing several children from a burning apartment building. Captain Johnsons life came to a tragic end on November 2. 2012. while battling flames in the attic of a twostory home on Chicagos South Side. He is survived by his wife of 28 years. Susan. two sons. Thomas and Michael. and daughter. Laurie. He also left behind so many others in Mount Greenwood and the surrounding area who knew him well not only as a courageous and dedicated public servant. but also as an outgoing and caring neighbor and friend. The outpouring of grief after his death demonstrated the impact he had on so many people. Naming a postal facility honoring Fire Captain Johnson is just a small tribute to our communitys appreciation not only for him. but all first responders who bravely put their lives on the line every day for people they do not know. This post office naming will ensure that Captain Herbie Johnson. his family. and the sacrifices of all first responders will always be remembered and appreciated. It will hopefully inspire more to follow in his footsteps. Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank all of my colleagues from Illinois for cosponsoring this bill. and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3085 in honoring Captain Herbert ""Herbie"" Johnson."
1130119586,Thank you. Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Speaker. I rise to honor two of our former colleagues. Phil Crane and Lane Evans. First. I didnt have the opportunity to serve with Mr. Crane. but Phil Crane was certainly a giant. as some of our previous speakers have saida giant of the conservative movement. He certainly served here in this institution but also just in the wider circles. especially in the eighties. He ran for President in 1980 but lost to Ronald Reagan. Yet many of those things that Ronald Reagan brought forward and saw through were things that Phil Crane stood for. While I may not agree with everything that Phil Crane did. there is really no denying the fact that he stood up for what he believed in. He fought very hard for what he believed in. and he was a great American patriot. I really. truly believe that. I also want to honor our former colleague and a friend and a mentor of mine. Lane Evans. From his time in the Marine Corps to nearly a quarter century in this House. Lane always put his country first. He bravely served in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam war. His experience in the military and his firsthand knowledge of veterans issues led him to become a leading advocate for veterans during his time in Congress. Certainly. many would say he was the leading advocate on issues critical to veterans. such as posttraumatic stress disorder. the effects of Agent Orange. and homelessness. He was consistently a leader in crafting real policy solutions. In addition to the great work on veterans issues. Lane always dutifully served his constituents in the State of Illinois. He was a strong advocate for working people. and he was one of the first to see the need for renewable energies. Personally. my own experience in Congress began about 30 years ago when I interned for Lane Evans. During my time in his office. he certainly showed me how to be a truly compassionate and effective leader in the House. Lane really cared about people. and that showed through in everything that he did. He was very passionate in all that he did. During his final years. he again showed his courage and strength in his fight with Parkinsons disease. If this terrible disease had not afflicted Lane. I am sure he would still be here today. fighting for his constituents. for hardworking families. and for all of our veterans. especially those who are coming home today. I send out my prayers to Lane and his family. We truly miss him. I had the opportunity to serve 4 years with Lane before he had to retire because of Parkinsons. but I really miss having Lane around. I think the example that he gave is truly something that we can look up to and emulate in what he did for the State of Illinois. along with what Phil Crane did for the State. We had two men who were very passionate. They had very different ideas. but they were very passionate about what they believed in. They fought hard for those things. and that certainly deserves our great respect. Our prayers go out to their families on this loss.
1130120395,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to welcome Blase Joseph Cupich as the ninth archbishop of the archdiocese of Chicago and to thank Cardinal Francis George for all of his years of service to the archdiocese. Archbishop Cupich is being installed today at a mass at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago. After many years of study in the U.S. and in Rome. including a doctorate at Catholic University. in August of 1975. Blase Cupich was ordained to the priesthood. In his first assignment. he served as associate pastor at St. Margaret Mary Church and as an instructor at Paul VI High School in Omaha. From 1981 to 1987. he served as secretary of the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See to the United States here in Washington. D.C. Cupich was appointed bishop of Rapid City. South Dakota. by St. Pope John Paul II on July 6. 1998. Pope Benedict XVI appointed Cupich bishop of Spokane on June 30. 2010. and he was installed as the sixth bishop on September 3. 2010. Cupich has served as chair of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on the Protection for Children and Young People since 2008. He has remained a strong advocate for children. saying that the Catholic Church needs to put children first and foremost. In March 2013. he began a 3year term as chairman of the National Catholic Education Association. In addition to his dedication to Catholic education. Archbishop Cupich is committed to Catholic social teaching of reaching out to help the poor and others at the margins of society. Yesterday. at the Rite of Reception. he spoke of the challenges that await him. including immigration reform. violence in the streets. drug problems. and staying connected to the real lives of people. I look forward to working together with our new archbishop as he addresses these issues and other challenges that we face. Archbishop Cupich is succeeding Cardinal Francis George. who has been archbishop of Chicago for 17 years. Cardinal George was ordained to the priesthood in 1963 at his home parish of St. Pascal Church in Chicago. Illinois. His older sister. Margaret. remembers a young Cardinal George holding pretend masses in his bedroom as a child. After earning several degrees. including his masters in theology from the University of Ottawa in 1971. Cardinal George embarked on a journey across the globe as a student missionary. From 1974 to 1986. he served as vicar general of the oblates in Rome. In this position. he led numerous priests and brothers as they journeyed across the world. Cardinal George then went on to earn two doctorates. In 1997. he was appointed by St. Pope John Paul II as archbishop of Chicago. and in 1998. he was elevated to cardinal. Despite being diagnosed with polio at age 13 and battling cancer currently. Cardinal George has never slowed down. ""Even illness can be a gift in some way."" Cardinal George has said. His spirited demeanor is wellknown to Catholics. Bishop Francis Kane has said. ""Hes involved on so many levels. Hes involved nationally. Hes involved in our whole archdiocese. and then he loves to go out to individual parishes."" Cardinal Georges outreach goes beyond the Catholic community. He is known to convene interreligious discussions and shows deep respect for other faith communities. and he is deeply committed to social justice that reaches to all corners of our society. On a personal level. the more that I had the opportunity to get to know Cardinal George. the more I have admired him. He is an intellectual powerhouse who has a special ability to communicate great truths in a simple manner. Every time I hear him speak. I learn something that enriches both my mind and my faith. but his intellect is not a distant intellect of a philosopher in an abstract world. but it is wellgrounded in an understanding of the everyday life of his people. and as someone who appreciates straightforwardness. I have always liked his directness. Maybe that is because Cardinal George and I both come from Chicago. I will never forget the time he took my wife. Judy. and me 2 years ago in Rome on the eve of the installation of Pope Francis. He truly is a remarkable man and a great shepherd. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me today in welcoming Archbishop Cupich and honoring Cardinal Francis George. I offer both men my prayers as they enter into a new phase of their new calling by God and the Catholic Church to the service of others."

1130001122,It is an honor to be here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen. I rise in defense of the American people. I believe that we are at a tipping point in our history. I really believe that we are at one of those inflection points at which we will decide our future. at which we will decide who we are as a people. at which we will decide the America that we leave to our children in a way that hasnt been decided before. This is a generational moment. This time is that important. At its heart. I think the debate comes down to this: Will we reclaim the moral and fiscal discipline that created the American Dream? Will we reclaim the moral and the fiscal discipline that created the worlds first and the worlds greatest middle class? Will we reclaim the moral and fiscal discipline that made us. as Abraham Lincoln described us. the last best hope on Earth? That is the essence of our challenge. That is the great and defining argument of our day. In this debate. Id like to remind all of us of a few critical facts. One of them is that this Nation. a Nation that is bankrupt. cannot provide for the security of its people. A Nation that is bankrupt cannot provide for the needy or for the poor among us. A Nation that is bankrupt cannot provide for the future of their children. Yes. during these challenging times. it will require a commitment to fairness. and it will require a commitment to compassion. It always has. There has always been compassion in this Nation. That defines much of who we areallowing the safety net to continue for those who truly need it. But where is the compassion in allowing a program. like my parents depended on in the final years of their lives. to continue down a pathway towards bankruptcy? Where is the compassion in creating so much uncertainty that our own children no longer have faith in their futures or in the social and safety net that has been there for previous generations? If you believe in compassion and fairness. then help us fix these problems. Help us to save them. Help us to provide so that we can pass them on to future generations. Since the last election. this administration has talked about one thing and one thing only. and that is taxes. We have had that fight. and he has won. He got his tax increase. and that will raise between $60 billion and $70 billion. but the last deficit was $1.1 trillion. Mr. President. what about the other trillion dollars now? What do we do now? We have a 6 percent solution. Its a great start if you like raising taxes. but it doesnt address the problems at all. My father was an Air Force pilot. He was a pilot during World War II. and I had the great honor of serving for 14 years as an Air Force pilot as well. If there was one thing I learned from my father and those brave men and women with whom I served. it was courage. always to have courage. That is what we need now. That is the only thing that can save us. Mr. President and Members of this body. let us have the courage to do the right thing even if that thing proves to be hard. Our debt is unsustainable. We talk about saving our Nation for our children. We dont have that long. Let us take the steps to restore financial sanity in this Congress in this day.
1130007028,I thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding his time. I had the great blessing of growing up on a family farm. I know what its like as a kid to be so excited to go hunting with my brothers and with my father that you cant sleep the night before. I also had the great privilege of serving for 14 years as a pilot and an officer in the United States Air Force. There I learned a little bit about defending our Nation through an adequate show of force. I also. by the way. qualified as an expert marksman in small arms. Recent and saddening events of violence have brought conversations about guns to the national stage. These acts of violence. as terrible as they are. should not be used by the White House as justification to revoke the rights outlined in our Constitution. The Second Amendment clearly states that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Our Founding Fathers created this amendment to protect the citizens from government tyranny. In 2008. the Supreme Court emphatically stated that the right to bear arms is an individual right. Today. it continues to ensure Americans right to defend themselves against the evil in the world. Based on a survey as recently as 2000. U.S. civilians do use guns to protect themselves and others from crime at least 990.000 times a yearalmost 1 million times a year. Its critical that we continue to protect this personal and absolute right. While gunrelated violence is indeed tragicand we all know that it is. as my friend. the gentleman from Indiana. has so eloquently stated. we bleed for those who suffer from thisits important to note that it only accounts for a small portion of the violent crimes that are committed in the United States. As an example. the U.S. Department of Justice has said that of the roughly 5 million violent crimes committed in the United States during 2008. only 8 percent were committed by offenders who visibly were armed with a gun. Most of those crimes were committed with guns that were already illegal. Even the U.S. Justice Department conducted a survey in the 1990s and found that approximately 79 percent of the State prison inmates that carried a firearm during an offense that sent them to jail received their gun either through an illegal source or from one of their friends or family. Stricter laws to ban guns will not solve any of these problems. We already have many laws in place. but instead of creating new and harsher laws. we need to do a better job of enforcing the gun laws that we currently have. Finally. let me say this: I believe that the timing of this proposal and these bills. it just isnt right. At a time when sequestration just went into effect and our country is on a path towards bankruptcy. its unacceptable that the White House continues to push its gun control agenda. We need to be focusing on getting our country back on a path of fiscal sanity. We need the President and his administration to show leadership. We need to ensure that America maintains its leadership role in the world. To do that. we need to budget and to spend responsibly. We need to replace President Obamas sequesterand it is this Presidents sequesterwith commonsense spending cuts and reforms. Most importantly. we need the President to demonstrate an understanding of the Nations need to balance our budget and get us back on a path towards fiscal sanity. That is the great fight of our day. That is the great challenge that we are facing. My heart bleeds for the victims of gun violencewhether theyre in Newtown or in New York or in my home districtbut the Presidents proposals will not help. They arent designed to address the core problems of mental health or a culture that is steeped in violence. violence that is thrust upon our children through media that are bent upon making more money through the violence that they propagate. Mr. Speaker. lets concentrate our attention on the greatest challenge of our day. not on a BandAid of additional laws that are designed to do nothing but to make some liberals feel better. To the gentleman from Indiana. I yield back and thank you for this opportunity to address the House.
1130010547,"Mr. Chairman. I am honoredyea. I am thrilledto stand and speak on this subject. It is the primary reason that I ran for Congress. and I think it is the defining issue and the most critical argument of our day. We are at a crossroads in our history. I believe that this time is that important. What we do at this moment will determine the future of our Nation. It will determine the future of our children. It will determine the future or the death of the American Dream. Stephen Covey. one of the great innovators and business leaders of our generation and a man who happens to be from my home State of Utah. popularized a time management concept called the ""urgentimportant matrix."" The point of this was to help us focus on those things that are both urgent and important and to let the other things go. Frankly. as a Congress. we do a terrible job at that. We often legislate based on the crisis of the moment. lurching from one manmade crisis to another. and the budget is a great example of that. For years. we have treated this as if it is neither urgent nor important. as if it could go on forever. but we know that thats not true. We also know now what this President believes. He doesnt think its important to balance our books. He doesnt think its important to cut our debt. He has no intention of cutting any spending. Not only does he not intend to balance our budget. but he derides and dismisses those of us who think that its important to our future. but Americans understand this. and its not that hard. Please listen to me on this because this is so important: a Nation that is bankrupt cannot provide for the security of its citizens. A Nation that is bankrupt cannot provide for the poor and the needy among them. I speak now primarily to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: if you care about the poorand I know that you do. By the way. I do as wellthen care enough to help them in the long run. not just for the next few years. There is nothing compassionate about letting Medicaid or Medicare go into bankruptcy. There is nothing compassionate about letting Social Security fail. but thats whats going to happen if we dont have the courage to fix this thing. We have to fix it now. This is both important and urgent. Many of us had hoped that the President would lead on this matter. but he has chosen not to. Its not in his nature. he is much more comfortable leading from behind. Since he wont lead. those of us in Congress will. I admire Chairman RYAN. I thank him for his courage in tackling a challenge that has terrified Congress for yearsreforming entitlements in a way that will save them for our children. We have a window within which we can make a difference. We can save America. We can save the American Dream. Please. let us have the courage to do that. That is why I support Chairman RYANs budget and urge my colleagues to do so as well."
1130052403,Mr. Speaker. this is a frustrating time in Washington. For the first time in 17 years. our government has been shut down. I believe the political gridlock is at a discouraging high mark. I empathize with those who are feeling its devastating effects. especially those hardworking people who have been affected by furloughs. including some members of my own family. So I rise today in defense of the American people and I ask one simple question: Why wont the President and HARRY REID sit down and talk to us? The American people are hurting. They want to see progress. They want to see us work and fix this in a bipartisan way. So why wont the President and the Senate leader sit down and engage us in a simple conversation? What are they afraid of? The President of the United States is the President of all of the people. He is not just the President of the Democratic Party. He is not just the President of those States in which he won. He is the President of the United States. He is the President of everyone. He owes it to the American people to listen to their voices. So let me ask again. what is he afraid of? Why wont he sit down and talk with us? I represent more than 700.000 people in my home State of Utah. They want the government to stay open. but they do not want ObamaCare. They know what a horrible piece of legislation it is. They know and they already see that it is destroying jobs. They know it is hurting working families. They know that it is driving up costs. They want the President to know this. They want HARRY REID to listen to their concerns. but both of them refuse to talk to us. So let me ask again. what are they afraid of? Are they afraid that they might be actually convinced that we are right? Are they afraid that they might have to compromise just a little? I am the father of six children. I know what it is like to have teenagers in the house. I know what happens when they get angry because they dont get their way. They run to their bedroom. they slam the door. and they refuse to come out and talk. Mr. Speaker. it is time for our President to take out his ear buds. to open the door. to come out and talk to us. He has canceled his trip to Asia. But I ask why. for what purpose. if he still refuses to come out and talk to us. My goal throughout the last several weeks has been to find a way to fund the government operations. other than ObamaCare. and to avoid a government shutdown. But once again. unfortunately. President Obama and Senator REID have expressed no willingness. no willingness at all to compromise. We have to understand that we are engaged in a generational fight over our debt and spending as it goes far beyond ObamaCare. Our current national debt is approaching $17 trillion. and it is growing every moment. During this administration. we will more than double our national debt. but it doesnt just end there. This is about the reach of government into our lives. with ObamaCare just being one example of how our government has grown too large and too powerful. In addition. this law will come with something like a $1.3 trillion price tag. That is something that we simply cant afford. It is critical that we work together now to reduce the size and the power of government in our lives. House Republicans have repeatedly come to the table to negotiate over the past several weeks. So once again I ask. what are they afraid of? Why wont they sit down and talk to us? As a former President. one of my heroes. John F. Kennedy said. let us never fear to negotiate. Mr. Speaker. I will continue to do everything in my power along with my other colleagues to find a solution to reopen the government while fighting to make Washington. D.C.. less important and less powerful in the lives of American citizens.
1130054263,"Mr. Speaker. politics is full of irony. and I believe that that is a vast understatement compared to what is exhibited on this floor almost every day. Sometimes that irony bleeds over into the absurd. and thats what we are facing today when it comes to our President. who absolutely refuses to even sit down and negotiate over the debt ceiling limit or over the implementation of ObamaCare or over the continuing resolution or. frankly. over anything else. Think about that. The President of the United States is unwilling to even sit down to have any negotiationsto have even a conversationwith the Speaker of the House. The President likes to say. I won the election. and he likes to remind us that elections have consequences. but I would remind the President that I won my election as well and so did 233 other House Republicans. I represent more than 700.000 people. Those 233 House Republicans represent more than 150 million people. They expect certain things of us. They expect us to represent them. They expect us to fight for those values that we promised that we would. I cant abandon those values. I owe it to my constituents. I owe it to my family. I owe it to my Nation. I owe it to myself to continue to fight for those values that. I think. help to make this Nation the great Nation that it is. The President is the President of the United States. He is not just the President of the Democratic Party. He is not just the President of those States in which he won. He is the President of the United States. and he owes it to the Americans to be willing to sit down and to try to negotiate when we come into a conflict such as we have now. Yes. weve got great challenges before us. but we can work through these. We always have before. We can find a way to work together. Republicans and Democrats have been working through their differences for generations. but we can only do that if we are willing to sit down and talk with each other. We can only do that if we are willing to be respectful of the deeply held positions that each of us holds. We can only do that if we are willing to work together for the betterment of this Nation. which brings me to the debt limit. It is like a dark. looming cloud that hangs over us now. We cant ignore it. We cant pretend that it doesnt matter. We cant pretend that its not important. So. like others. I would like to quote from one who is considered to be a great political leader of this century: Increasing Americas debt weakens us domestically and internationally. ""Leadership"" means that the buck stops here. Instead. Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and our grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. Mr. Speaker. of course Im not quoting TED CRUZ or MITCH MCCONNELL or the Speaker of the House. I am quoting a young freshman Senator who is now the President of the United States. who at least at one point in his career recognized the serious and the longstanding threat to this Nation that our rising debt is. We have the opportunity to work together now to fix this problem. and if we cant fix it. at least we can take a meaningful step forward. I hope the President will work with us to address what he used to believe was a serious problem. but I believe it starts with one thing: sitting down together and talking in order to work it out. The American citizensall of usdeserve a President who is willing to lead. The American people deserve a President who is willing to talk. Yes. we live in a day in which there are policy and political differences. but that has always been the case. From the birth of our Nation. it has always been such. We are a Nation in which ideas and principles sometimes conflict. but the American people deserve a President who understands that negotiating is part of the process. I pray that the President will sit down and talk with us now."
1130058398,"Thank you. Mr. WENSTRUP. for organizing this Special Order honoring our countrys heroes. It is a privilege for me to be with you tonight. As you mentioned. I come from a family with deep roots in the military. I was a pilot for 14 years. and my father was a pilot in World War II. Four of my five brothers have served in the military. I have to tell you. my time flying in the military was. in many ways. the happiest years of my life. I remember I would be up flying. and I would think I cant believe that they pay me to do this. I would do this for free if I could. In addition to my family members. three of my congressional staff are veterans. I know firsthand some of the sacrifices that come with servicethe time away from family. the personal discomforts. the danger. being put in harms wayfor many of our soldiers. all to protect our Nation and to protect the freedoms of others. There have been great sacrifices in the past. Some of those we have heard about tonight. I suspect that we will probably hear about some others. I would like to mention one man from my hometown of Farmington. Utah. I think he is a great example of sacrifice and courage. His name is Lieutenant Colonel Jay Hess. He spent 51/2 years as a prisoner of war at the Hanoi Hilton during the Vietnam war. During this time. you can imagine what he enduredstarvation. beatings. isolation. and deprivations. which it is very difficultprobably impossiblefor us to appreciate. After 21/2 years. he was finally given a letter from his family. As he read this letter. he found himself smiling. and after awhile it hurt. because those smile muscles had not been exercised in 212 years and he had lost that ability to smile. It was a joyous day when he was returned to his family. his wife and five children. Despite all of this hardship. he looks back on his life and his experience with great humility and appreciation. He said. ""How could I be so lucky? So fortunate? It is a good life."" This man was a true American hero. Heroism continues today. This fall I had the opportunity to honor four Army soldiers. Two of them. Sergeant Daryl Williams and Sergeant John Russell. were jogging here on the National Mall one morning when they heard a collision. They looked over and saw that a civilian had been hit by a bus. They didnt hesitate. They knew immediately what to do. They ran over. and using their shirts. they provided a tourniquet and they saved this mans life. That may seem like a small thing. but it is a great example. once again. of the caliber of men and women that we find serving in our United States military. As Veterans Day approaches. I find myself humbled to share this background and experience with such people. I have always said that the military is the greatest incubator for leadership that there is anywhere in the world. and we see that demonstrated again and again. Let me end with this. The United States of America is a special place. I recognize that most nations feel that way. Every one is proud of the land from which they come. I think God intended that they should feel that way. That is a good thing. Even though that is true. there is something special about this place. There is something truly unique about the United States. and there is no better example of that than the young men and young women that serve in our United States military. We dont fight to conquer people. we fight to keep a people free. We dont fight to capture a land. we fight to set a land free. The only thing we have ever asked is. as Colin Powell once said. the only land we have ever demanded is a tiny piece of pasture in which we could bury our soldier dead. If you have ever been to a military cemeteryand they are spread all over the world. from France to England to the Netherlands to Panama to the Philippines to Japanif you have walked among those stonecold graves. then you know that this is sacred land. A poet once wrote about these soldiers: Here dead we lie. because we did not choose to live And shame that land from which we had sprung Life. to be sure. is nothing much to lose But young men think it is And we were all young I. like millions of other Americans. will always be grateful for their sacrifice. I honor them. and once again I am grateful to be among them."
1130068590,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank my friend and colleague TOM RICE for introducing this important resolution. I am proud to stand in support of this. and I thank him for giving me a few minutes to discuss what is a very. very important issue today. My friend knows that I was a writer. Before I came to Congress. I wrote a number of books. I spent a lot of time writing about and studying this great Nationabout the history of this Nation. about the history of the worldand I think I know a little bit about some of these things. I think one of the most remarkable but underappreciated characteristics of General George Washington. who was. I think. a hero for many of us. was his deference to the Continental Congress during the American Revolution. Although in many cases he knew what needed to be done. he always recognized that he derived his authorityhe derived all of his powernot from himself but from the Congress. and he understood that the Congress was the organization and the body that held the power and the keys to a successful government. It is a lesson. as we have been discussing here tonight. that. unfortunately. this President does not seem to appreciate or to even understand. Our Founding Fathers made it very clear in the Constitution that the responsibility of the President was to take care that the laws be faithfully executednot selectively chosen. not preferred or some of them ignored. but faithfully executed. It is his constitutional responsibility. but time and time again. we have seen this President as he ignores this constitutionally mandated responsibility. He prefers to pick and to choose which laws he will enforce. I would like to quote eminent Judge Michael McConnell. who recently wrote: The Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel. which advises the President on legal and constitutional issues. has repeatedly opined that the President may decline to enforce laws he believes are unconstitutional. but these opinions have always insisted that the President has no authority to refuse to enforce a statute which he simply opposes for policy reasons. This has become a very troubling trend for this President. As my friend has already pointed out. among other examples. he has already declined to enforce immigration laws against a large number of illegal immigrants. He has chosen not to enforce work requirements that Congress mandated as part of the 1990 welfare reform programs. programs which had broad bipartisan support and which everyone recognizes were very successful. He has chosen to change the congressional requirements that States must meet under No Child Left Behind. and in none of these cases did he say he believed the laws were unconstitutional. He simply disagreed with the policies and so refused to enforce those laws. Now. we may or may not agree with the President on the merits of these policies. but as an institution. Congress should be extraordinarily concerned that the President is usurping our role as legislators. and it is setting a very dangerous precedent. The President. for example. went to great lengths to convince the Supreme Court and other Americans that the Affordable Care Act was. indeed. constitutional. He won that battle. which means he should have to enforce this law that he argued was constitutional or. if not. come to Congress and ask for changes to the law. but over the last few months. we have seen numerous delays and exemptions to ObamaCare without any input at all from Congress. Now. once again. regardless of your views on the merits of ObamaCare. the Presidents actions should make everyone who respects the separation of power and the role of the executive very uncomfortable. Can you imagine if Governor Romney had been elected President and if. on his first day in office. he had said. ""I am going to delay the employer mandate""? Do you think any of my colleagues from across the aisle would have supported him in that? Imagine if he had said. again as was illustrated before. ""I think that the capital gains tax is too high. To get our economy going. I am just not going to enforce the capital gains tax for a year."" I mean. if he had done that. heads would have exploded all over Washington. DC. Why would that have happened? He doesnt have the authority. The Constitution forbids it. We have a President. not a king. I dont want this President to act that way. I dont want a Republican President to act that way. Our Founding Fathers would be horrified if they were alive today and were watching what is happening with our Constitution and the growing power of the Presidency. This is dangerous. and it is demeaning to our democracy. and it simply must stop. I hope the President will remember his constitutionally mandated responsibility to enforce all laws. not just those laws that he chooses to enforce because he agrees with them."
1130084777,Mr. Chairman. I thank Dr. PRICE. who is one of the really bright lights here in Congress. for his leadership on this. Imagine the CEO of a business telling the board of directors that he would like to buy a new piece of equipment. Unfortunately. this piece of equipment is fairly expensive. But there is good news. and that is. by buying and making this investment. they are going to become more profitable. they are going to improve their cash flow. they are going to be able to hire more people and grow the business. That is a beautiful thing. But then imagine that the board of directors goes back to the CEO and says. yes. you have to consider the cost of this equipment but you cannot consider the benefits of buying this piece of equipment. so it messes up entirely his profit projections. They are not able to consider the higher revenue and the growth that this company would undertake. That would be absurd and. of course. that wouldnt be a sound business decision. But that is exactly the situation that we find ourselves in right now. The Congressional Budget Office does not have the ability to account for economic growth. specifically. the impact on GDP when it comes from tax cuts. CBO is. unfortunately. in the role of the board of directors telling the businessowneror the business CEO. in my examplethat it cant use the full toolkit of economic modeling in making projections upon which to make these critical decisions. I have a degree in economics. I was a small business owner. I understand this isnt rocket science. The modeling of this is relatively simple. It is certainly something that we could do. and we hurt ourselves when we dont allow us to take advantage of this modeling. There is something that Members from both sides of the aisle can agree upon. and it is that many times the numbers provided by CBO are simply not accurate. This is a way that will fix that. Part of the reason they object. frankly. is that it underestimates the impact of tax cuts. Mr. Chairman. this is something that could help us make better decisions. I implore Members to support it.
1130111495,Mr. Speaker. we live in a very dangerous world. It seems like there is chaos and darkness all around us. As a former Air Force pilot. I have seen the results of abusive power in a very real way. It seems like every time we turn on the television or we read the news. we get the feeling that the world is being turned upside down. The wheels have come off the train and we seem to be careening towards the cliff: Russia takes Crimea and then sends ununiformed troops into eastern Ukraine. tens of thousands of deaths in Syria. with millions of refugees. the recent evacuation of our own Embassy in Libya. Iran working toward a nuclear weapon. ISIS in Iraq creating essentially a terrorist state. the crisis of Chinese power threatening significant parts of the Eastern world. The list of concerns is very long. indeed. But nowhere is the strife and uncertainty more dangerous. more strategic. and more critical to U.S. interests than what we are witnessing in Israel and their military operations in Gaza. Israel is the most important ally in the region that we have. It has the only democratically elected government in a very unstable and violent part of the world. It has a vibrant. free capitalistic society that respects human rights. that respects womens rights. that respects minority rights. even the religious minorities. Let me say this as clearly and as unambiguously as I can: Israel is our friend and our ally. So tonight we stand with Israel and state without equivocation that Israel has a right to defend itself. Let me set the stage for the crisis that is happening right now. very quickly. September 2005: Israel withdraws from Gaza Strip. home to some 1.8 million people. Thousands of Israelis are uprooted and missile fire from Gaza into Israel increases dramatically. A few short months later. in January 2006. Hamas deposes Fatah. wins elections. and becomes the ruling party of Gaza. The United States. Britain. and all the European Union consider Hamas a terrorist organization. June 2007: Hamas seizes power in Gaza with Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority. Skipping ahead now to May 2014: rocket attacks from Gaza to Israel increase. June 12. 2014: Three Israeli teenagers are kidnapped and killed on the West Bank. The PA aids Israel Defense Forces in clamping down on Hamas in the West Bank and tension increases significantly. As a result of that. Hamas unleashes hundreds of rockets in Israel. Finally. July 7. 2014: the Israel Defense Forces launch Operation Protective Edge. Its goal is to stop the insistent rocket attacks in Israel. Within a week. they expand to an offensive ground war. Its purpose is to destroy Hamas tunnels built for military use against Israel. Now. we will talk more about these tunnels. but let me mention just briefly that. to date. Israel has uncovered more than 66 access shafts to 30 tunnels. Palestinian militants have fired. to date. more than 2.000 rockets since the fighting began Let me put that in perspective before I turn the time over to some of my colleagues. Imagine. if you will. that al Qaeda or ISIS in Iraq has pledged the destruction of the U.S.. something which is not hard to imagine. Now imagine they placed a military frigate off our eastern shore. Now. they claim that it is a supply ship. they say that it has no military purpose. that it only has civilian and peaceful purposes. But then imagine they start lobbing not a few and not dozens. but hundreds of rockets and missiles along our eastern shore. specifically targeting cities where millions of innocent families live. What would we do? What should we do. Would you expect your government. your President. to protect you? Of course. we would. We would defend ourselves. We would seek the elimination of the threat. We would protect our own people. our values. our way of life. Any Nation would. and every Nation should be able to do that. That is all the State of Israel is asking: the right to defend itself. That is why we are here tonight. to defend a friend and ally against not only missiles and rockets. but against an onslaught of deception in the world of public opinion. We want our friends in Israel to know that they do not stand alone. I have invited some of my friends and colleagues to share the floor with me this evening as we stand firm and united in the defense of Israel and their right to protect themselves. I would like to begin with my colleague Dr. WENSTRUP from Ohio. He is a fellow veteran. he has served in the Army Reserves since 1989. and served a tour in Iraq. He sits on the House Armed Services and the Committee on Veterans Affairs. I yield to Dr.

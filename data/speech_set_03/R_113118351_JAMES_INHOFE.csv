1130013536,"Mr. President. it is with great pleasure that I join my friend Senator LEAHY from Vermont in introducing. the Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act of 2013. As I stated when we introduced this bill in the 112th Congress. our bill seeks to identify and eliminate unhealthy and unsafe prison conditions found in developing countries like Haiti and on the African continent where millions suffer inhumane conditions as well as to address the dysfunctions in their legal systems. The introduction of this bill comes at an appropriate time because Jon Hammer. the imprisoned U.S. Marine being held in the Cedes Prison in Matamoras. Mexico was freed this past December 21st. Corporal Hammer. who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. was arrested in August and charged with a Federal weapons felonyfacing up to 15 years in prison. for carrying an antique gun into Mexico on his way to Costa Rica for a hunting trip. despite. as I understand it. having a required permit and attempting to declare the gun. During the past 90 days. he faced the same harsh conditions that our bill is trying to address. Namely. Hammer was housed in an overcrowded and unsanitary prison. beaten by fellow inmates who were members of the murderous Mexican drug cartels. threatened with death in an extortion attempt by these inmates and chained to a bed. I had been involved in seeking Jons release for several weeks. and I was heartened when he was released. His treatment. however. serves as an excellent example of the deficiencies found everyday in foreign prisons worldwide from Africa to no further away than our southern border. Our bill focuses on eliminating excessive pretrial detention and dysfunctional justice systems which frequently result in prisoners and other detainees spending years in unhealthy prison conditions before their cases are even adjudicated. Tragically. inadequate. misplaced or lost records often result in the incarcerated being held indefinitely because their cases have never been heard. Unbelievably. such poor recordkeeping has kept many in prison long after their sentences have been served. Our bill also encourages these nations to provide humane and sanitary prison conditions so that prisoners can be released in good health. and thus stem one of the causes of the spread of HIV and tuberculosis among the general public. Our bill calls upon the Department of State to submit to Congress an annual report for five years that describes inhuman prison conditions at least 30 countries receiving U.S. foreign assistance. It gives the Secretary of State and Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development the discretion to restructure. reprogram or reduce U.S. foreign assistance to these countries based upon whether they are making ""significant efforts"" to eliminate inhuman conditions in their prisons and other detention facilities. The goals of this bill are noble. but it will take close monitoring and hard work by our U.S. Foreign Service personnel on the ground overseas to fulfill this work. That is why our bill directs the Secretary of State to provide training to these embassy and consulate personnel so that they can effectively investigate and assess prison conditions in foreign prisons as well as assist these foreign governments to adopt substantive prison reforms. The Secretary is also directed to designate and task a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State within the Bureau of Democracy. Human Rights and Labor with the responsibility for gathering the information for the annual report and make recommendations to the Secretary based off its conclusions. I have made 128 African country visits over the past 16 years. and I believe that given the chance. the majority of Africas leaders will welcome the opportunity to interact with our embassy and consulate personnel and adopt the best practices for achieving the elimination of unhealthy and unsafe conditions in their prisons and other detention facilities. It is also my hope that our neighbors to the south will adopt safe and sanitary prisons conditions and correct the dysfunctions in their justice systems so that another U.S. citizen does not have to spend 90 days in prison for a paperwork error. The task at hand reminds me of the teaching of Jesus in Matthew 25:39:40 when he said. ""When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you? And the King will answer them. Truly. I say to you. as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers. you did it to me."" We are all our brothers keepers. By Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself. Mr. VITTER. Mr. COONS. Mr."
1130047107,"Mr. President. first of all. I wasnt going to do this. but since my good friend from California is on the floor and it is our favorite subject to talk about. I thought I would. I wish to take the opportunity to talk about the first round of the major global warming regulations the President is set to release this week. These rules will govern the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from powerplants and they are the first round of rules following the Presidents major speech on global warming in June. The rules represent the most aggressive representation of the war on fossil fuels we have seen in this administration. and we have seen a lot of them. We know the rules will require any coalfired plant to have carboncapture and sequestration technology. that is. CSS technology. While the Clean Air Act only allows feasible technology to be mandated. the CSS technology is not feasible. It is really not there yet. No powerplant has ever been built with the technology unless it has been supported by massive taxpayer subsidies. The rule would kill the coal powerplant industry. While the rules may be constructed in a way that allows natural gasfired powerplants to meet the mandate. we have to know that is coming next. After all. natural gas is a fossil fuel as well. There have been several statements of people saying. Well. wait around until fossil fuel. which is going to be next. The only thing these new rules will do is cause energy prices to skyrocket. I expect the rules to be one of the key issues covered by the media this week. While the exact details of the rule will not be known until it is published later this week. there are a few things that we know right now. First. the science behind global warming is now more uncertain than ever. I spoke about this this morning in our hearing. Just last week it was reported all over the mediathe Telegraphthis is in London. one of their largest publicationsthe Guardian. also in London. the Wall Street Journal. and others. that this year there has been 60 percent more ice coverage in the Arctic than there was this time last year. My colleagues might remember the hysterical people were saying at one time that there would be no more icecaps by 2013. Instead. we find out it has actually increased by 60 percent. This is the equivalent of almost 1 million square miles. and this is being observed before the winter refreeze has even set in. What makes it more interesting is that in 2007. the BBC reported that global warming would leave the entire Arctic icefree in the summers by 2013. The scientist who made this claim. Professor Wineslaw Maslowski. said. in the typical bravado we have come to expect from climate scientists. that ""This is not a cycle. not just a fluctuation. In the end. it will all just melt away quite suddenly."" That is in 2013. Well. here we are in 2013 and guess what. They are wrong again. There is 60 percent more ice than there was at this time last year. A lot of the yachts and the ships that expected to use the Northwest Passage cant use the Northwest Passage. it is closed. closed because the ice is there. This follows reports earlier this year. notably from The Economist. showing that global warming has been on a pause for the last 15 years. The Economist wrote: ""Over the past 15 years. air temperatures and the Earths surface have been flat while greenhousegas emissions have continued to soar."" The U.N.s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did not expect this development to occur. nor did its models predict that there would be a 15year stall in global warming. Professor Anastasios Tsonis. at the University of Wisconsin. recently concluded that: We are already in a cooling trend. which I think will continue for the next fifteen years at least. There is no doubt the warming of the 1980s and 1990s has stopped. This reminds me of all the hysteria in the 1970s that a global warming trend is coming. I cant tell my colleagues how many times on the Senate floor I have talked about how these cycles come and go about every 25 years. and here it is. right on schedule. going into a cooling period. Starting back in 1895. every 15 to 20 years. they start out with the new Ice Age is coming. everyone is hysterical. and then in 200719701919. they went into a period of warming. and then in 1995or 1945they went into another cooling spell and that happened to coincide with the year they had the greatest surge in CO2 on our planet. I only want to say this finally has come to our attention that we are looking at a situation that is quite different than we have seen in the past. I mentioned that later in this month the longawaited event is going to happen. It comes up every 5. 6. or 7 years. That is when the IPCC comes out with its assessment. This just came upI saw that it is dated today in the Wall Street Journal. and I will read this: Later this month. a longawaited event that last happened in 2007 will recur. Like a returning comet. it will be taken to portend ominous happenings. I refer to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes fifth assessment report. That is what we are talking about. They go on to say they have learned from some leaks what is in that assessment. ""There have already been leaks""-I am reading now-""from this 31page document which summarizes 1.914 pages of scientific discussion. but thanks to a senior climate scientist. I have had a glimpse of the key prediction at the heart of the document. Keep in mind. this is IPCC. United Nations. The big news is that for the first time since these reports started coming out in 1990. the new one dials back the alarm. It states that the temperature rise we can expect as a result of manmade emissions from carbon dioxide is lower than the IPCC expected. This is something we did not anticipate would happen just as recently as a few days ago. Real quickly. it is my hope we get to some of these amendments. and I am going to mention one that is a very significant amendment. A few months ago. when we were debating the continuing resolution. the Senate adopted amendment No. 29. which prohibited the EPA from enforcing this Spill Prevention. Containment. and Countermeasure Rule. That is the SPCC rule. As we all remember. they were going to enforce this against farmers. The reason we did this is clear: EPA first threatened to enforce this rule against farmers at the beginning of the Obama administration. but they did very little outreach. Most farmers do not even know today about this rule or what they would have to do to comply. The only reason other Members know about this rule is because of the work Senator PRYOR and I have done to highlight the problem for what it is. This rule was originally drafted for compliance by major handlers of oilrefineries. pipelinesplayers such as the ones that are shown on this chart I have in the Chamber. This chart actually shows part of Cushing. OK. which is a major hub of oil pipelines. Millions of barrels of oil are transported through and stored in this small town each day. and it is incredibly important that the handlers of the oil follow appropriate regulations to make sure accidents do not cause significant environmental damage. They understand why the regulations are in place. and they follow the rules with precision. And we are talking about the people in the adjoining towns. These refineries and tank operators are who the rule was designed for in the first place. and that makes sense. But now EPA wants to enforce that rule against farmers. What would it look like if we did this? First. take a look at this second chart. This is a diesel fuel container on a farm. It is small. It does not hold that much fuel. But right now it is subject to the same regulations you would have for oil companies and refineries. I asked a friend of mine. Keith Kisling. a wheat farmer in western Oklahoma. what it would take for him to comply with this rule that was designed for refiners. He said: First I have to purchase a new doublewall container that would cost thousands of dollars. EPA justifies this by saying it would prevent leaks. Keith. like all other farmers I know in Oklahoma. thinks diesel is expensive. So Keith is not going to let his tanks leak. whatever kind it is. You would sit on a farm and realize that is leaking money. Obviously. they do not want to do that. The next thing he would have to do is build a berm all the way around his tank to contain a spill if all of the diesel fuel came out of it. This would be expensive and difficult to operate."
1130066571,Mr. President. I would like to announce the reintroduction of a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the taxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and natural gas produced from marginal properties. Since 1926 small producers and millions of royalty owners have had the option to utilize percentage depletion to both simplify their accounting methodology and to account for the decline in the value of minerals produced from a property. Percentage depletion is particularly important to Americas 700.000 lowvolume marginal wells. The average marginal well produces barely 2 barrels per day. yet cumulatively they account for nearly 28 percent of domestic production in the lower 48 states. Since every onshore natural gas and oil well eventually declines into marginal production. the economic life span and corresponding production of all wells is extended by allowing the use of percentage depletion. Until 1998. the deduction marginal producers could take from percentage depletion was limited to 100 percent of taxable income from each individual property. Many producers. however. specialize in marginally producing wells and have many properties operating simultaneously. Naturally. some wells in a producers portfolio are more productive than others. Some would have depletion rates greater than 100 percent of taxable income. while others would have depletion rates lower than the limit. Removing the taxable income limitation allows producers to take percentage depletion deductions on a portfoliowide basis. which makes their entire operation more economical. Since 1998. Congress has understood this fact and has suspended the limitation. Unfortunately. the provision has never been made permanent. It has just been extended year after year as part of the Tax Extenders Package. Since we have had this suspension on the books for more than a decade. I think it is time to give producers the predictability they need by making this common sense tax accounting provision permanent. At a time when our unemployment rate remains over 7 percent. we need to be doing everything we can to encourage economic growth. The energy industry is a major contributor to our economy. and it has a lot of room to grow. The Congressional Research Service released a report that says the United States has the most energy potential under its soil than any other country on earth. Hiding beneath our soil are jobs. wealth. and lower deficits. We should allow this sector to grow. This is a common sense. easy way to do this. so I urge swift passage. By Mr. INHOFE:
1130079196,"Mr. President. I spoke last night in anticipation of this allnight session that was going to take place. I was not surprised at the general topics that were covered. There are probably five all together that they were stated over and over. I would like to clarify a couple of things that probably are worthwhile this afternoon. One is my good friend from Californiathis is a quote. we took it downsaid: When 97 to 98 percent of the scientists say something is real. they do not have anything pressing them to say that other than the truth. They do not have any other agenda. They dont work for oil companies. And I will tell you. as chairman of the environment committee. every time the Republicans chose a socalled expert on climate. we have tracked them down to special interest funding. those 3 percent. They know where their bread is buttered. That is kind of an interesting and a timely statement to make because what they are not telling youand I am talking about the Senator from California and the other Democratsis that the hedge fund billionaire and climate activist Tom Steyer plans to spend $100 million through his NextGen PAC. The NextGen PAC is his political action committee. He has made the statement that he is going to be spending $100 million in the midterm elections of 2014 and is going to be looking very carefully to make sure that all of the Democrats go along with his activist agenda. That was actually a statement that was made. that has been written up. It is all documented. I am going to submit for the RECORD at this point all of the newspaper articles. the Washington Post. the Washington Times. and others that talk about this climate activist Tom Steyer. who is going to be spending $100 million in the next election. What I would like to do is cover the points that were made. As I say. they were made over and over. different people saying them. the same talking points. I am sure Tom Steyers people had the talking points well prepared and moveon.org and George Soros and Michael Moore and the Hollywood elites and that crowd all had their talking points to sound real good. I noticed that so many of them were reading those points and were not familiar with the issues. But last night many of my colleagues pointed to weather as the reason for manmade climate change. Yet they failed to quote meteorologists in the speeches. Let me read just what the meteorologists are saying about climate change. A recent study by George Mason University reportedthat was over 400 TV meteorologiststhey reported that 63 percent of the weathercasters believe that any global warming that occurs is the result of natural variations and not human activity. That is a significant 2to1 majority. Another study by the American Meteorological Society last year found that of their members. nearly half did not believe in manmade global warming. Furthermore. the survey found that scientists who professed liberal political views were more likely to proclaim manmade climate change than the rest of their colleagues. I think we can name names here. Certainly one of the more prominent names is Heidi Cullen. She was with the Weather Channel. She spent most of her time with a background of very liberal thinking. liberal agenda. talking about this until she is no longer there anymore. She is now with one of the groups. the very liberal groups. This is a good one. a lifelong liberal Democrat. His name is Dr. Martin Hertzberg. He is a retired Navy meteorologist with a Ph.D. in physical chemistry who also declared his dissent of warming fears in 2008. This is a quote from Dr. Martin Hertzberg: As a scientist and lifelong liberal Democrat. I find the constant regurgitation of the anecdotal. fear mongering claptrap about humancaused global warming to be a disservice to science. The global warming alarmists dont even bother with data! All they have are halfbaked computer models that are totally out of touch with reality and have already been proven to be false. CNN. not exactly a bastion of conservatism. had yet another of its meteorologists dissent from global warming fears. His name is Chad Myers. a meteorologist for 22 years and certified by the American Meteorological Society. spoke out against anthropogenic climate change on CNN in December of He said. ""You know. to think that we could affect weather all that much is pretty arrogant."" Since they are talking about the weather. here are a few facts that are not mentioned on drought and hurricanes. Several of the people came to the floor during the evening to talk about increase in drought. the increase in hurricanes and all of that. According to NOAA. hurricanes have been in decline in the United States since the beginning of records in the 19th century. The worst decade for majorcategory 3. 4. 5hurricanes was in the 1940s. Severe drought in 1934 covered 80 percent of the country. The current one. the drought we went through a year and a half ago was 25 percent of the country. Then they talked about. last night. the icecaps are melting and all of that. My colleague Senator FEINSTEIN from California pointed to melting icecaps as proof of climate change. Yet reports on what is not melting show a different story. This past December a research expedition of climate scientists got stuck in deep ice in Antarctica. We all remember that. I remember talking about that and showing pictures on the floor when that took place. That was a bunch of people who were going up there to try to solidify their case on global warming. They were stuck in ice for weeks on end. It took a couple of weeks and a couple more icebreakers getting stuck before the research vessel was finally freed. A paper published in the October Journal of Climate examines the trend of sea ice extent along the east Antarctic coast from 2000 to 2008 and finds a significant increase. average of 1.43. That is 1.5 percent a year of increase of ice in the Antarctic. Greenland. the IPCCnow. keep in mind. I talked yesterday about the IPCC. That is the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In a minute. I will show how it was discredited. But in Greenland they saidthey admitted that in 2001. to melt Greenland the ice sheet would require temperatures to rise by 5.5 degrees Celsius and remain for 1.000 years. The ice sheet is actually growing by 2 percent a year. That is what is going on right now on this very ice sheet. Everyone is concerned about Greenland. Yet it is actually growing. not decreasing. In January 2010. Time magazine: Himalayan Melting: How a Climate Panel Got it Wrong: ""Glaciergate"" is a black eye for the IPCC and the climatescience community as a whole. In December of 2008. Al Gore saidthis is good. Al Gore said. ""The entireThat is a little over 5 years ago. Gore said. ""The entire North polar icecap will disappear in 5 years."" It is now 5 years and 1 month past the deadline. December of 2013. and the Arctic ice is actually doing pretty well. Last month. BBC reported that the Arctic icecap coverage is close to 50 percent more than in the corresponding period in 2012. So contrary to what Al Gore predicted. that it would be gone by now. it did not disappear. I had a good quote there by Richard Lindzen talking about Gore. This is Richard Lindzen. one of the foremost authorities. scientific authorities on climate anywhere in the world. He is MIT. He has been quoted extensively. He said. talking about Gore: To treat all changes as something to fear is bad enough. To do it in order to exploit that fear is much worse. I mentioned last night that the New York Times designated Al Gore as perhaps the first environmental billionaire in the United States. He said the entire North polar icecap would disappear in 5 years. It has actually increased substantially. Last night they talked about the IPCC is the gold standard of climate science. Senator WHITEHOUSE defended the credibility of the IPCC despite climategate. saying last night: So after all that. after six published reviews whose results confirmed that there was nothing wrong with the science as a result of these emailsWe are talking about climategate now. -for people to continue to come to the floor and suggest that the email chains revealed some flaw in the data or some flaw in the science. its untrue. Its as simple as that. Its just not true. But we know this is not the case. The emails are very clear that the scientists were manipulating the data to generate a result they wanted. This is what some of the emails disclose: One of the scientists said. and the emails disclosed. that the IPCC was systematically distorting facts. cooking the science of global warming to either cover up data that did not tell the story they wanted everyone to hear and exaggerating the impacts of the changing climate to help drive peopleout of fearinto action. Here are two examples. We have about 12 examples. I have read them all in the past on the floor of the Senate. But here are a couple of examples of how the IPCC was cooking the science."
1130088547,Mr. President. today marks the 225th anniversary of George Washingtons inaugural address to the Nation. I dont think anyone has said anything about it. That is a major thing for us to think about each year. It is the 225th anniversary. It is reported that more than 10.000 peoplethis is way back 225 years agogathered on this day in 1789 to hear from a man who won a war and who is now ushering in an era of peace and freedom in our new Nation. Peter Lillback is a historian. and he pointed out in his book. which I read recently. that our first President. Washington. knew that everything he was to say in the first inaugural address would set a precedent for all that was to come after him in establishing our Nation. It is why Americans should take note at how Washington weaved in with intentionality his belief in the Omnipotent. Washington said: It would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official Act. my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the Universe. Washington went on to say: No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand. which conducts the Affairs of men more than the People of the United States. Every step. by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation. seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency. We are here because of the hand of God. Washingtons leadership was grounded in his belief in God. His law. and that liberty is Gods gift. As we reflect on the anniversary of Washingtons speech it is important we are reminded as a nation what our Founding Fathers sought to establish. In this same inaugural speech Washington said: The destiny of the Republic model of Government. are justly considered as deeply. perhaps as finally staked. on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people. Washingtons conviction was that we as Americans are entrusted by God to preserve basic freedoms established in the Constitution. such as the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion. The secular culture we see our Nation embracing today would seek to censor such words from a leader such as Washington. Their intolerance fails to acknowledge it was Washingtons convictions and our Founding Fathers faith values that gave us the public square. On September 27 last year. I talked about this issue on the Senate floorabout how Oklahomans regularly ask meand I dont think this is unique to Oklahoma. it can be true in any Statewhy we have an administration that suppresses our JudeoChristian values while praising Islam. As I said then. I find it sad that our Nation does not have the same belief today that we had back when Washington was President. We have become arrogant. inwardfocused individuals. Rather than submitting to Gods authority. we define truth. justice. and morality by what feels good at the time. Today. instead of having leaders who protect the church from government. we have leaders who believe it is the governments job to impose on churches what should be universally upheld as truth. As leaders. we should be protecting all Americans freedom to practice their religion. It is only appropriate that on this anniversary we also consider the words of Washingtons Farewell Address in 1796 where he pointed out that the pillars supporting our Republic are morality and religion. In his address he said: Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of particular structure. reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle. We have to restore the morality of our Nation given to us by the Founding Fathers. as President Washington articulated 225 years ago. That morality is found in the JudeoChristian values articulated not just by Washington but by all of our Founding Fathers. As my son likes to say: Without God. the Constitution is nothing but a piece of paper. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1130103740,"Madam President. I wish to remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man. Army SPC Dylan J. Johnson. Dylan died 3 years ago today. June 26. 2011. of injuries suffered from an improvised explosive device in Diyala Province. Iraq. in support of Operation New Dawn. Dylan was born November 07. 1990. in Tulsa. OK. His father Jeff Johnson said Dylan ""had aspired to military service for years and dressed as a soldier for Halloween six years running."" After Dylan graduated from Jenks High School. he joined the military in August 2009. largely inspired by the men on both sides of his family who served with the military during World War II and Korea. After completing basic training at Fort Knox. KY. Dylan was assigned to the 4th Squadron. 9th Cavalry Regiment. 2d Brigade Combat Team. 1st Cavalry Division in Fort Hood. TX. Specialist Johnson departed on Memorial Day 2011 for his first overseas deployment and arrived in Iraq June 2. On June 26. 2011. Dylan tragically died of injuries he sustained when insurgents attacked his armored vehicle with an improvised explosive device. One other soldier in the vehicle was killed alongside of Dylan. ""Dylan possessed a kind spirit and was a bit reserved in my world literature class."" said teacher. Ron Acebo. ""We all ache for the loss of this young life and grieve with his family. As teachers. we all hold hopes and dreams for our students. We do not know what he could have achieved but we are humbled that he had made the supreme sacrifice for his country. ... and that is how he will be remembered."" A memorial service was held July 6. 2011. at Kirk of the Hills Church in Tulsa. OK and he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on August 9. At a ceremony on his birthday in 2013. the State of Oklahoma dedicated to his memory the bridge on U.S. 75 across Polecat Creek. just south of Main Street in Jenks. OK. A sign reading ""Specialist Dylan Johnson Memorial Bridge"" was emplaced on the structure. and his father asked those gathered to remember Oklahomas other fallen soldiers when they cross it. Dylanss military honors include the Purple Heart. the Bronze Star. the Army Good Conduct Medal. the National Defense Service Medal. and the Iraqi Campaign Medal with Combat Service Star. In addition to his father. Dylan is survived by his mother Joy Sehl. his stepmother Lynda Johnson. two sisters. Alexandra Johnson and Kathryn Sehl. and two stepsisters. Brittany Dinan and Brooke Dinan. All are of Tulsa. OK. Today we remember Army SPC Dylan J. Johnson. a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom."
1130108973,"Madam President. I wish to pay tribute to Army SGT Vinson B. ""Trinity"" Adkinson III. Sergeant Adkinson and three other soldiers died August 31. 2010. when an improvised explosive device blew up next to their vehicle near Forward Operating Base Shank. Logar province. Afghanistan. Known by family and friends as ""Trinity"" because he was the third Vinson in his family. he was born on December 13. 1983. and grew up in Empire City. OK. before moving in his junior year of high school to live with an aunt in Kansas. His father recalled interest in the Armed Forces was stoked early for Trinity as the first toys his son played with were G.I. Joes. ""He played army outside. he trick or treated as an armyman."" Adkinson Jr. said. ""Me and him spent a lot of time outside in the woods. He was born to be a soldier."" Trinity enlisted in the Army immediately after graduating from Chaparral High School in Harper. KS. in 2003. He started his career with the 82nd Airborne Division followed by serving with the Honor Guard of the 4th Infantry Division. Later assigned to the 173rd Brigade Support Battalion. 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Bamberg. Germany. Trinity served three tours in Iraq and was on his second tour in Afghanistan. ""I begged him not to go back."" said grandmother Mary Adkinson after seeing her grandson earlier this year. She said he told her he needed to return to Afghanistan so that the people of that nation could have peace in their lives. He was preceded in death by his grandfathers. Vinson Bryon Adkinson. Sr.. and Robert Allen Morgan. Sr.. and is survived by his wife Veronica. father Vinson Bryon Adkinson. Jr.. of Comanche. OK. brother Jacob Aaron Adkinson of Stillwater. OK. sister Mary Kay Adkinson of Wichita. KS. his paternal grandmother Mary Ellen Adkinson of Duncan. OK. and maternal grandmother Sharon Kay Morgan of Wichita. KS. SGT David Shearouse served with Trinity and was given the task of escorting his remains home. ""He always wanted to take point. he wanted to be the leader."" he said of his fallen comrade. ""Everybody wanted to be like him. He was a good man. I lost my friend. my brother and my hero."" The family held a funeral service for Sergeant Adkinson on September 13. 2010. and he was laid to rest with full military honors in Fort Sill National Cemetery in Elgin. OK. Today we remember Army SGT Vinson B. Adkinson III. a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom."
1130114754,"Mr. President. when you look at what is happening with ISIS. we have gone through all kinds of terrorist activities. We all know we are in a crisis right now. I am inclined to agreeand I dont always agreewith Secretary Hagel. but on the day when he said that ""ISIS is an imminent threat to every interest we have. whether it is in Iraq or anywhere else."" this is a big deal. As America sat back and looked and observed and saw the beheading of two Americans. a lot of people said that was an act of war. I found out recently that as of yesterdayand it will be announced in the next few days that there is a poll that has been conducted. that if we take all the problems that are out there that people have been talking about for a long period of time. including the borders and all the other issues. nothing is even close to ISIS. I think it was very interesting that on August 28. just a few days ago. the President made the statement. ""We dont have a strategy yet"" to deal with ISIS in Syria. If there is not a strategy now. there has to be a strategy. I am introducing an AUMF resolution for action against ISIS. An AUMF is Authorization for Use of Military Force. This is something that perhaps the President has anywaywe dont know thatbut we have to take away the doubt that is out there. Something has to be done. I know the President is going to make a speechI guess it is on Wednesdayand he may come out with a specific strategy. If he doesnt. he has had all the time in the world he needs to do it. and he hasnt done it. My AUMF is specific to ISIS. There are other AUMFs dealing with Al Qaeda and other things. but to me that just confuses the issue. This has now become the No. 1 issue in America. and there is no tolerance to continue doing nothing. as we have been doing. We need to make sure the President has the authority. and this requires the President. within 15 days and then with 90day updates. to submit in writing to Congress a comprehensive strategy to defeat the global threat posed by ISIS. Keep in mind. it seems as if this President is inclined. anytime there is a problem out there. lets drop a bomb here and lets do something over there. That is not a strategy. I stated 1 year ago. on this same day. that the President cannot continue to operate without a clearcut strategy. So the congressional authorization for the President is to use all necessary and appropriate force to protect Americans in defending national security in the United States against a threat posed by ISIS and any successor terrorist organization. It allows the President to use all tools available and necessary to defeat ISIS. with flexibility to adjust efforts as the terrorist organization evolves. So this is not just limited to any boundaries. As you know. there are no boundaries with ISIS. It is not just Syria. it is not just Iraq. This is something that is spread all over. It is huge. and it is a threat unlike anything we have seen in our country before. So I am asking my good friendsI have already talked to several friends on the Democratic side and the Republican sideto join me. and I think hopefully we will be able to do it. It is estimated that 12.000 foreign fighters have joined ISIS. about 2.500 of which hold Western passports to give them easy access. What is going to happen is they will come back and be trained terrorists. I think that is a major issue that I want to at least have announced. I have introduced this resolution. It is out there right now and we are going to be asking for support."
1130119722,Mr. President. today I wish to pay tribute to a distinguished public servant and officer in the U.S. Army. LTG Peter M. Vangjel. General Vangjel served as the 64th Army inspector general and retires on February 1. 2015. after more than 37 years of selfless service to our Nation. Throughout his professional life. General Vangjel personified the Army values of duty. honor. and selfless service in leadership roles around the world and here at home. Many of us on Capitol Hill know General Vangjel by these qualities and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with him on a wide variety of Army issues and programs. It is my privilege to recognize his many significant contributions. General Vangjel is a native of New Hampshire and graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 1977. He served in a variety of command and staff assignments and has led our soldiers in both peace and war. in combat and humanitarian missions. in the United States. Europe. Asia. and the Middle East. He has proven himself as a stellar leader demonstrating unselfish devotion to the Nation. our leaders. soldiers and their families. For the final 3 years of his noteworthy career. General Vangjel served as the Army inspector general. providing independent and unbiased advice to the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army. His advice. assistance. and detailed oversight of timely. highvisibility inspections and investigations proved critical for an adaptive Army in transition. He personally led multiple efforts to promote readiness. resource stewardship and accountability of equipment. funds. personnel and leader behavior. As he has throughout his career. General Vangjel embraced his charter to conduct outreach to our Armys leaders. soldiers. families. and the public at every opportunity. stressing the importance of resource management and creativity. Nowhere was this more evident than during his 2year assignment to the Middle East. where he supervised efforts that provided nearly $8 billion dollars in cost avoidance and streamlined contracting and logistic support efforts as our troops surged in to Afghanistan and retrograded from Iraq. His vision. passion. and energy kept key military and civilian leaders aware of emerging trends enabling them to correct problems and anticipate future challenges. General Vangjel led his team in conducting many significant inspections enabling our Army to address critical issues. revise policies. and improve processes. His special inspections of Arlington National Cemetery restored effective oversight and reinstilled public confidence in the effort to honor our fallen heroes at a place sacred to all Americans. Likewise. his teams work to help our suffering soldiers receive more efficient behavioral health treatment within the Integrated Disability Evaluation System brought to light new information about process issues and the need for better coordination and support from Veterans Affairs. In addition. during his tenure. the Army inspector general performed vital compliance oversight inspections for some of our Nations most sensitive activities. including nuclear and chemical research and development centers. intelligence oversight. and information assurance operations. LTG Peter M. Vangjel has consistently provided superb leadership. advice. and sound professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring importance to the Army and our Nation. On behalf of Congress and the United States of America. I thank General Vangjel. his wife Joanne. and his entire family for their commitment and contributions to our Army and the Nation. and I congratulate them both on an exceptional career of selfless service.

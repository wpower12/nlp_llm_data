1140007034,Mr. Speaker. I would like to ask a few questions of my colleagues as it relates to health care. Has Congress made health care more accessible and affordable? Has the quality of care improved? No. Do hardworking families and our children deserve better? Absolutely. Now is the time to repeal and replace this disaster of a law. This law has hurt more poor and more middleincome families. I received a letter from a constituent. Mr. Speaker. the letter states: I wonder if you would like a reallife example of what ObamaCare is doing to families. My daughter and her husband are expecting their second child. They were planning on moving from their small apartment to a small home. Their insurance has doubled under ObamaCare. and they will pay $500 a month. Their deductible will be $10.000. They will have to pay each doctor for a phone call plus $50 copayment. No specialists are covered. They barely are getting by as it is. Because of their insurance costs. there is no chance of getting into a home or even a bigger apartment. How can insurance for everyone be of help if it causes such a financial burden on families? My daughter is so depressed. She isnt even excited about her upcoming child because she is so worried about their future. If we had the means to help. we would. but we dont. My heart breaks for her. How can Congress help? Sincerely. Paula. Now. people talk about tweaking ObamaCare. I ask: How do you tweak that to help that family? The American people deserve better. Mr. Speaker. Imagine a health care system that is centered in service. Imagine a health care system that is measured by outcomes. not by Washington dictates. I know that it is hard for some of my colleagues to contemplate. but imagine. if you will. for me. Mr. Speaker. a health care system where dollars and decisions are left with patients. their families. and their doctor. I see an American exceptionalism at work. where families and innovation and compassion drive the highest quality of care. Members of Congress. Representatives of the people. do not settle. Dont settle for just tweaking a bad program that hurts more than it helps. that controls more than it empowers. There are too many Members of this body that are content with just getting this health care law to be good enough. I am here to tell you that. for the American people. good enough just isnt good enough. I reject the downward spiral of mediocrity and government takeover of health care. I refuse to pursue the administrations path of fear. blame. and failure. I oppose this motion to recommit a bad health care law. It is time for us. for this body. to advance the policies and the principles which have lifted more people out of poverty. fueled more freedom. and driven more dreams than any other set of principles in the history of the world. I ask this body to come with me. boldly step forward and unleash that American exceptionalism that produces the health care solutions that this family is worthy of and every hardworking American in this country is worthy of. May God continue to bless this great. exceptional country. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140085343,I thank Chairman HENSARLING for his support of this bill. Mr. Speaker. economic freedom and personal freedom run hand in hand. In order to enjoy our personal freedom. Americans need access to credit as individuals. on behalf of their families. and in their businesses. That is why I am so proud to have introduced this bill. H.R. 3791 is a very simple bill to help small banks and savings and loan companies get access to the capital they need so as to make credit available in their communities. These small banking institutions are critical to the people and the communities in which they reside. They support the credit needs of families. of small businesses. of farmers. and of entrepreneurs. A community bank is often the principal lending source for many people whether they are purchasing a home. starting a new business. or purchasing a vehicle. In many counties around the Nation. a community bank is the only banking presence that residents have. When these community banking institutions are overwhelmed with regulations and mandates. many of which are meant for larger institutions. it is the hardworking middleincome and lowincome families in those communities who suffer the most. Mr. Speaker. it is about people. Community banks give people the credit they need to pursue their dreamsto buy a home. to start a business. In fact. proximity to a community bank increases the chances that new small businesses will be approved for loans and will have the chance to succeed. By raising the consolidated asset threshold under the Federal Reserves small bank holding company policy statement from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets. over 400 additional small bank and thrift holding companies will qualify for coverage under the policy statement and. therefore. will be exempt from certain regulatory and capital guidelines. These capital standards were originally established for larger institutions and disproportionately harm small holding companies. Many holding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges with regard to capital formation just when regulators are demanding higher capital levels. These exemptions provided in the policy statement make it easier for small holding companies to raise capital and issue debt. This bill is about making sure regulations fit the size of the institution. Mr. Speaker. a similar effort was passed into law during the last Congress under suspension in the House and by unanimous consent in the Senate. That bill raised the threshold from $500 million. where it has been since 1996. to $1 billion. That legislation also extended the exemption to savings and loan holding companies. While we are glad that we were able to achieve that increase which helped. roughly. 500 small bank and thrift holding companies. we would like to extend those benefits further. H.R. 3791 would bring more than 400 additional small institutions within the scope of the policy statement. One success story that we have already seen from the previous increase was an instance in which 35 bank holding companies pooled their resources to issue debt under the policy statement. That debt was then downstreamed to the respective banks. where the capital was then used to make loans in the communities they serve. illustrating the great multiplier effect that the policy statement can produce. H.R. 3791 seeks to extend that flexibility and success to a greater number of small institutions and the communities they serve. Opponents of this increase have alleged that changing the regulatory threshold would put communities and the Deposit Insurance Fund at higher risk. but the policy statement contains several safeguards that are designed to ensure that small bank holding companies that operate with the higher levels of debt permitted by the policy statement do not present an undue risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks. Mr. Speaker. to sum this up. this bill is not about supporting banks. It is about supporting families. communities. and small businesses. It is about making sure that a smallbusiness owner. like my constituent Jennifer Jones. has access to the credit she needs to expand her early childhood academy. where she teaches children to read before they reach kindergarten. It is about families who are sitting around their kitchen tables and are imagining the possibilities of renovating or of improving their homes. It is about that entrepreneur who is starting a restaurant and being her own boss. It is about the thousands of new jobs that will be created in those communities as a result. The raising of the threshold received widespread bipartisan support in the last Congress. and I hope that the people will receive equal support this time.

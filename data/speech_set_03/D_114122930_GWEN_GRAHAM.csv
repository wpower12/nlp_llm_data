1140009761,"and. frankly. countless other Republicans in the Senate and some in the House to do the responsible thing and let this House work its will on the single subject of our national security. If a clean Homeland Security appropriation bill were to come to the floor. I am confidentand I tell my friend and the majority leader. Mr. Speaker. every Democrat will vote for it. We are 188 strong. Surely. there are 30 responsible Republicans who care more about our national security than their politics who would join us in voting for that billI am confident of thatmany more. I think. than 30. but at least 30 would be needed. with 188. to get to the 218. and we would fund the Department of Homeland Security. and we could do it tomorrow. We could probably do it today by unanimous consentwell. no. I dont think we could do it by unanimous consent because there are some who continue to play politics with our national security. If the majority is dissatisfied with our immigration policy which they articulate and legitimately can have an alternative view to express and to try to enact. that is the democratic process. Offer a bill to change that which they do not like. not hold hostage the Department of Homeland Security until hopefully. from their standpoint. the President is bludgeoned into signing a bill that he does not agree with and he does not believe is good for our country and believes is bad for our economy. If the majority is dissatisfied. bring a bill to the floor. Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge. also a Republican with whom I have served when he was a Representative from Pennsylvania. subsequently the Governor of Pennsylvania and then our first Secretary of Homeland Security. I want to quote him as well as I have quoted the other two Republicans that I have quoted. ""Political folly"" and ""bad policy."" that is Tom Ridge. former Republican Governor and mentioned for President. He went on to say: ""I think the political repercussions could be severe. And. on top of that. the men and women of Homeland Security deserve better."" Who wants to work for an employer that simply takes them hostage every few months and says to them: You may or may not get paid. you may or may not be able to come to work. you may or may not be able to do your job. It depends upon whether or not our political ends are served. I urge Republican leaders to keep the pledge they made to the American people to consider issues one at a time. Bring a comprehensive immigration reform bill. If you dont like what the President has done. bring a bill that changes that. We have the power to do that. Do it. We can work in a bipartisan way to change our immigration policies through legislation and fix what everybody in this body believes is a broken system. Bring a clean appropriation bill to the floor to fund the Department of Homeland Security. and then. as well. bring a bill to the floor on comprehensive immigration reform or the bill that our Republican friends think is the appropriate bill to fix a broken system. and we will vote and debate on that. But let the Department of Homeland Security do its job for America. for Americans. Lets exercise responsible. adult legislating this time."
1140080087,Mr. Speaker. first I want to thank Congresswoman WATSON COLEMAN for holding this special session and bringing attention to the Equal Rights Amendment. When I was born in 1963. we lived in a different world. It was legal to openly discriminate against hiring women. it was legal to discriminate against women in lending and credit. it was legal to pay women substantially less than men. and it was legal to fire a woman just for becoming pregnant. Fortunately. when I was born. things were beginning to change. Women were fighting for and gaining greater equality. Today. women are better protected from those forms of discrimination. We have made great strides. but we havent yet been able to recognize our equality in the Constitution. There is nothing more sacred. nothing more important to America than our Constitution. I support the Equal Rights Amendment because I grew up in a changing world. but I want my daughter and the next generation to grow up in a changed world. I want my daughter to live in a country where her and every womans equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. To illustrate why I believe we should and still can ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. I want to specifically speak about the history of the ERA in my home State of Florida. Our House of Representatives voted for ratification of the ERA three separate timesin 1972. 1975. and 1979but our Senate remained more divided on the issue. Bill Cotterell. a columnist for the Tallahassee Democrat. recently opined: It was still a very different world. where a Member of the legislature walked around with a toy pig under his arm. proudly proclaiming himself a male chauvinist. It was a different world. one still changing. but I am proud to say there were men who stood up for the women of our State in the State senate. One of them was my father. Bob Graham. who bucked his own Democratic Party leadership to support the ERA. a move that helped earn him the title of a doghouse Democrat. After repeated failures in the Senate. some thought the ERA was dead. but it resurfaced in Florida in 1982. That summer. just a few weeks remaining before the ratification deadline. more than 10.000 men and women marched on our State capitol in support of the amendment. Hearing their call and supporting their cause. my father. who had moved out of the doghouse into the Governors mansion. called our legislature into special session. For the fourth time. the House voted in favor of the amendment. but unfortunately the senate blocked ratification. That was 34 years ago. And today I believe our State is better than that. I believe. given another chance to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Democrats and Republicans in Florida could be united to support equality for women. I am proud to have grown up in a changing world. but it is time for our daughters and the next generation of women to grow up in a changed world. It is time to recognize their equality in our Constitution. I thank the Congresswoman for bringing attention to this issue and for all that you do on behalf of women.
1140111787,"I thank Congressman JOLLY. and I thank Congressman DEUTCH very much for arranging this tonight. It means a lot. I feel the same anxiety just being as close to the larvae as others feel. and I might just ask that the gentleman keeps them in the jar. Madam Speaker. let me talk about my home State of Florida. I was born and raised in south Florida. I think. right around now. the Sun is probably setting in south Florida. The weather is nice. It is 80 degrees. The sky is that beautiful pink that we get. Vacationing tourists are strolling along the beach or are enjoying dinner on a patio. SomewhereI know thisthere is a dad outside who is grilling steaks. and moms are watching soccer practice. That is our life. That is our life in the beautiful State of Florida. It is like a lot of other places around this country except. right now in Florida. families are scared. I have thought about the gentleman and Laura. and I understand that fear. Families are scared because. as the Sun sets. the mosquitoes are coming out. For all of our lives we have lived with mosquitoes. It is part of our life in Florida. but now they are more than a nuisance. Now they are a deadly threat. We are scared because there is a deadly virus spreading. Parents are scared that. if their children are bitten. they could get terribly sick. Seniors are scared that. if they catch the disease. they may not survive. Pregnant women are scared that they will wake up one morning with a mosquito bite and that it may cause the children inside them to be born with terrible birth defects. My daughter would be appalled for me to say this. but she is 25. She doesnt live in Florida right now. I hope she will move back. but the risk of pregnancy right now would not be one that I would want her to take. So this is the new normal in Florida. More than 600 people in Florida have been infected with the Zika virus. Almost 100 pregnant women in Florida have been infected. We have been sounding the alarm for months. havent we. Congressman JOLLY? I have come on this floor to ask for funding to fight the disease. I led a letter with more than 120 Democrats that asked Speaker RYAN to have a vote on full funding to fight the disease. I did a workday with the local mosquito control team in Bay County. and I have asked my constituents in north Florida to do their part to fight off the spreading disease. I ask againparticularly now. following Hermine. as we have had a lot of water in our areato please go out and make sure that you dump any standing water. I am really proud of all that we are doing as Floridians to try and stop the spread of Zika in Florida. Florida State University is researching the virus and making important breakthroughs. [ 1830 Local municipalities are spraying. Ordinary people. as I said. are dumping standing water out of their yard. We are doing our part in Florida. Now. it is time for Congress to act and do their part as well. Madam Speaker. yesterday I joined a bipartisan letter with Florida Republicans and Democrats who are asking for one simple thing: Give us a vote on a clean bill that would fully fund the fight against Zika. Give us a vote on a clean bill that would fully fund the fight against Zika. This is a public health emergency. Just as important. lets give scientists the certainty they need to research and develop a vaccine for Zika. and this could take several years. Prematurely cutting off resources before the vaccine is ready could be just as dangerous as not providing enough money today. I spoke with the scientists. As they develop vaccines. they go through different trial stages. Ethically. you cant start a vaccine study. ask people to participate. and then say: ""Never mind. Our funding has dried up. You are not going to be able to continue."" That is not something that we could do. Our delegation has shown that Republicans and Democrats have come together on this issue. and I believe that the entire Congress can as well. There are Republicans and Democrats in States along the Gulf CoastTexas. Mississippi. Louisianawho will come together and support full funding because their constituents are at risk. too. I am still holding out hope that Speaker RYAN will be able to support full funding to fight this deadly virus. Time is running out. It is time to put partisanship aside and vote on full funding to fight this horrific disease. Zika. We must all come together to make sure that the resources are there for mosquito control and for vaccine production."

1140008190,Mr. President. I wish to honor Coach Gene Bess of Three Rivers College in Poplar Bluff. MO. As a coach for Three Rivers College. Gene has had an amazing career that has spanned four decades. During that time. he has maintained a winning percentage of 78 percent with an average of 27 wins per year. He has not had a losing season since becoming Three Rivers Colleges head coach in 1971. Coach Bess has led the Three Rivers College Raiders to 17 tournament appearances in the National Junior College Athletic Association. NJCAA tournament. where his career record is 4119. The Raiders have reached the Final Four of the NJCAA tournament nine times. while winning national championships in 1979 and 1992. Gene has been recognized as the NJCAA Coach of the Year twice. the Regional Coach of the Year on 18 occasions. and the Midwest Community College Athletic Conference Coach of the Year 19 times. He is a member of the Poplar Bluff Sports Hall of Fame. the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. and the NJCAA Hall of Fame. Coach Bess is one of the best basketball coaches to ever blow a whistle in college basketball. and this month. he became the first college basketball coach ever to reach 1.200 victories. This is a tremendous feat for a coach in any sport. at any level. Prior to his recordsetting career at Three Rivers College. Coach Bess had a very successful record at the high school level when coaching at Lesterville. Anniston. and Oran. Over a 12year period. these Bessera teams won over 250 games. ending in appropriate fashion with his Oran team playing for the Missouri Class M State Championship. Oran lost that game 7674. yet the Bess legacy was only beginning. The leadership and dedication that Gene Bess demonstrates as a basketball coach. does not stop on the court. Instead. it translates into his personal and public life. He has been married for nearly 54 years and is a deacon at the First Baptist Church of Poplar Bluff. He and his wife Nelda have two children. Janell Hartmann and Brian. one of the Raiders assistant coaches. and four grandchildren. Faith and family always come before his work. and this is just one secret to his success. I ask that all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Coach Bess and the Three Rivers Raiders on this rare milestone of 1.200 victories. a record that is unsurpassed at any level.*
1140010487,"Let me mention a few of those. but I will submit all 22 for the RECORD. As early as March of 2008. the President said: I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we are facing right now are things that dont go through Congress at all. In November of 2010 the President said: I am the President. not a king. I cant do these things just by myself. I have to have partners to do it. In January of 2013. the President. again. still believes he is not a king. because he says: I am not a king. He says that at two different events on that day. He says: We cant simply ignore the law. The truth is. in November of 2014 the President does decide we can simply ignore the law. The 22 times the President said we couldnt ignore the law I agree with him. For those who believe I dont find enough opportunities to agree with the President. here are 22 times I agree with the Presidents view that he cannot do these kinds of things on his own and by himself. On February 14. 20132 years agothe President said: The problem is that I am the President of the United States. I could actually quit right there and maybe that would say all I need to say. but of course he said: The problem is that you know Im the president of the United States. Im not the emperor of the United States . . . we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place. It goes on. I get to that point. and I dont know quite how to explainas I am sure the President doesnt know how to explainwhat he has said and what he has now done. On September 2013: ""My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed."" still in full agreement with what the President said his job is. As late as August of this last year. the President said: There are some things we cant do. Congress has the power of the purse. for example. Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I dont have a green light. He goes on to suggest to do whatever the President might like to do. That is basically what this debate is about right now. It is not about whether the Department of Homeland Security would continue to function. In fact. what I wish to see is the President engaged as the principal officer responsible for the administration of the government. I think something like that is what President Kennedy said after the Bay of Pigs. when he said: I am responsible here because I am the principal officer responsible for the administration of the government. The President created this problem. He created this funding problem for States. he created this funding problem for the Federal Government. and he created this problem of exceeding his authority as President of the United States. But the President. once again. is missing from the discussion of how to solve the problem. That could very well be. as is often the case. the person who would know how to solve the problem is the person who created it. But we are not hearing anything from that person because clearly people at the White House believe it is to their temporary political advantage to act as though the people in the Congress dont want the government to function. rather than to act as though people in the Congress believe the President was right the 22 times he said he couldnt do what he has now done. I have heard several of my colleagues in the last few daysin fact. even one or two this morning on early news showssay: We need a way for Congress to settle these kinds of disputes outside of the appropriations process. One way to do that would be to pass a law I filed in the last Congress that the House of Representatives passed in a bipartisan waythe Senate was not allowed to vote on it and I would like to see us vote on it in this Congresswhich is the ENFORCE the Law Act. which simply does allow the Congress. if a majority of the Members of the House or Senate believes the President is not enforcing the law as written. to go to a judge and seek an early determination. rather than wait for some aggrieved citizen who disagrees with a rule or regulation to have to hire their own lawyer after the rule is in effect. and in the 2 years or so it might take to get that case to the Supreme Court. other individuals impacted by the rule or regulation are trying to comply with it. only to find out later. as the Court ruled a handful of times during the recent years of this Presidency that. no. the President doesnt have the authority to do that. They said: No. you dont have the authority to appoint people to the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate is in session just because you have decided somehow the Senate is not in session. You dont get to decide whether the Senate is in session. Mr. President. if they have met all the requirements to be in session. You particularly dont get to decide whether the Senate is in session if that same session of the Senate approves some things that you thought needed to be done and that was good enough for you. Then they said: Mr. President. by the way. when you appoint these people illegally. whatever rules and regulations they put forward arent legal either. So the couple of years of businesses trying to comply with the National Labor Relations Act rules and regulations. all of that is to the wayside. Those rules are all gone. but that doesnt restore the time. effort. money. and needless compliance that happens when the President exceeds his authority or when the Presidents agencies. such as the Environmental Protection Agency. decide they could do something they would like to do without ever arguing before the Congress that we would like the authority to do this. So passing the ENFORCE the Law Act would be a way to seek an earlier or quicker remedy. It does appear to me that the Federal judges are likely to decide pretty quicklyFederal judges. the court of appeals level and then the circuit levelthat. no. Mr. President. you have gone beyond where you were in fact. You were right the first 22 times. not the November 2014 time that you decided if you dont like the law. you dont have to enforce the law. I think we should move forward with that ability that the Congress currently doesnt have. but also I think we should continue to express our desire for this process to work the way it is supposed to work. The House of Representatives. which is supposed to initiate spending bills. has done that. It is the job of the Senate to debate those spending bills. It is the job of Senators to offer amendments if they dont like them. and so far our friends on the other side have insisted they dont want to do that part of this job. Maybe we all should understand why they dont want to defend what the President has done because of all the times he said he couldnt do it."
1140063861,"Mr. President. before I start my remarks. let me say how pleased I am to see Senator REED and Senator COLLINS here with this important bill. the opportunity to amend the bill and do the business we should be doing. This Senator is also glad to be here with Senator KLOBUCHAR. She and I cochair the Senate side of the congressional caucus on adoption. and the resolution that was just agreed to adopts November as National Adoption Month. and November 21 as National Adoption Day. While we are here talking about this. all of our States have kids who need to be adopted. If you went to the Missouri Department of Social Services Web site today. you would find 114 foster youth who are ready and waiting to be adopted. If you looked around the country today. you would find that there are 415.000 children in the U.S. foster care system and 108.000 of those kids are waiting to be adopted. Last year 22.000 young men and women aged out of the foster care system and they never got that opportunity for the permanent home. the forever home that could make such a difference in their lives. not only as a kid but their lives as an adult. I have two or three kids I want to talk about. Austin is 12. He is full of energy. He has a great smile. He is extremely active. as lots of 12yearold boys are. He loves to be outside. He enjoys. as he would phrase it. ""going on adventures."" He likes animals. He would like to live on a farm one day. He likes basketball. He likes being on his basketball team. but mostly he would like to have a family. Mostly his dream is the dream that he would have a family to encourage him and support him. There are two other young brothers. aged 11 and 7. When you first meet Mykez. you can tell he is relaxed. He is laid back. He is an easy guy to be with. In his free time he likes being active. He likes to be on his bike. He likes to play football. If it is possible being outdoors. he would like to be outdoors. but he is also happy with a video game or with the TV. At school he likes history class the best. but his best grade in school is art. His brother Jameer appears to be pretty shy and quiet. but once he gets to know you. he easily turns on the charm. He is a football and basketball guy as well. but he enjoys quiet activities such as drawing. reading. and coloring. He loves being with his brother. He loves video games. His favorite class is math. earning his highest grade there. But what they would like is a family. They would like a family that would allow them to keep in contact with their siblings but would also give them some structure. some attention. and some consistency that has been missing in their life. Marissa is 5. She has some challenges. She is a sweet. loving girl. She is happy. curious. and loves to laugh. She has a hard time right now expressing herself in lots of other ways. She is working on building her vowels and consonant sounds. She works on her sign language vocabulary. She has a spunky attitude. but she would melt the heart of a future family if those things ever become connected. There are tens of thousands of children all over the country just like them who just need a familytens of thousands of children where a family could make all the difference in the world. not only when they are growing up but when they are adults and they have that family to turn back to. Nobody is better to work with on these issues than Senator KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with her and then come back to me in a little bit after she has had a chance to talk about the importance of National Adoption Month and National Adoption Day."
1140063866,I think this is a problem. and there are lots of families in the United States who would love to have kids from wherever in the world kids are who need families. The two examples you have just given are some of the frustrations of international adoption in just the last few years. where thousands of kids were coming to the United States from other countries such as China. Ethiopia. Guatemala. the Democratic Republic of the Congo. and certainly from Russia. The tragedy of so many of these stories is that the child has suddenly seen that opportunity. they have bonded with families. and they have gone through the whole process. Many people. when Russia stopped Russian adoptions. were ready to go to court. had been to Russia multiple times and had exchanged visits and photos. Not only is it that the family is ready for the adoption to occur. but. more importantly. the person who is to be adopted is ready for the adoption to occur. Just to show what can happen. in the case of Russia. the kids who were closest to being adopted by American families. the Russian Government suddenly created incentives to put them at the top of a list that doesnt get much attention. which gave special incentives to Russian families to adopt these kids before the American families who were ready to welcome them could adopt them. We are having a meeting today with the Ambassador from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. and I am grateful the Ambassador would come. Our real concern there is that there are many kids in the Congo who had actually been adopted. There was a commission that had been put in place to study the question of why they cant get their exit visas now to leave with the families the courts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have said could adopt these kids and that group has been disbanded. All that is necessary there is the exit opportunitythe exit permissionto leave the country to go with the families who have already legally adopted them. The Senator and I and several of our colleagues are going to meet with the Ambassador today. We are glad he is coming. We would like to see that meeting result in going back and looking at cases where their government has already decided this is a great match for these kids and these families and figure out how to let those families get their kids to the United States.
1140072634,Mr. President. I was also able to talk about some good news. I am not sure how much good news we are going to hear over the next few days. but certainly there is the good news of stepping up and looking at health care research and the impact it can have in the country. There are things that are beginning to happen in mental health and things that we are trying to do to respond to prescription drug abuse and opioid abuse in all areas. In health care research. the National Institutes of Health hadnt received an increase in their research funding since 2003. There was an effort made right before that to make a substantial increase. The fact that the Congress and the administration stopped research funding had always been frustrating. but we were able to see an increase this year for the first time in 12 years. That meant we had to create a priority. For too many people in government. when there is a discussion about funding priorities. a lot of our colleagues hear that and think that means we have to fund anything anybody has ever convinced the government we are interested in. Being interested in something doesnt make it a priority. it just makes it something that. if everything was going along the right way. maybe this is something to look at. But in funding NIH at a new level. we totally eliminated 18 programs. zeroed them out. We didnt eliminate the authorization for them. but we eliminated the money to run those 18 programs. Congress and eventually the President accepted the argument that for the greater good. these 18 programs did not need to continue. The President asked for 23 new programs that also did not receive funding. but that allowed us to make a commitment and to set priorities. Why set a priority? The first funding increase in 12 years was 6.6 percent. We went from spending $30 billion on health care research last year to $32 billion this year. Hopefully this is a first step toward trying to solve health care problems. There are many changing developments in health care. from smartphone technology. to individual medicine. to knowing more about the human genome. How did we find out about the human genome? We found that out through NIH research. If we hadnt had NIH research. it is likely that the human genome would still be a mystery to us. It had been a mystery on the planet until just a few years ago. The reason that happened was the National Institutes of Health and the Congress decided it would be helpful to figure out how all of us are different from each other. which also means trying to figure out a different approach to curing diseases such as cancer. Alzheimers. and heart disease. What difference does it make? Why is it a priority to spend taxpayers money in this way? One reason is the clear impact health care research is having every day on individuals and families who no longer are dealing with problems they would have been dealing with 10 years ago. Moving forward. lets see if we can find ways to meet the challenges for families and caregivers. Lets see what we can do there. Generally. for taxpayers. even if you arent the individual beneficiary. estimates are that the Medicare system will be absolutely overwhelmed between now and 2050 by things such as Alzheimers and cancer. If we can figure out a cure or delay onset of Alzheimers by 5 or 7 years on average. the impact on the cost of that devastating diseaseboth the real cost to taxpayers and the emotional and psychological costs to everybody involvedwill be overwhelming. The Medicare system wont be able to withstand the projections of how much money will be spent if we dont find ways to deal with these new challenges. As people get older. Alzheimers and cancer are more likely to end life than heart disease and stroke. That doesnt mean we dont need to be focused on neurological research or on heart research. All of those things are important. and a relatively small investment by the Federal Government on health care to try do something about that matters. It is generally understood that health care will dramatically change in the next 10 or 20 years. Where the research is done is likely to be where the jobs and economic impact of that research occurs. I dont want to be going to the Chinese 10 years from now saying: Will you tell us how your investment in research has paid off? We are better at this than anybody else in the world. and we need to continue to be better. There are reasons for us to be better. I do visit some of the places where this research is being done. I was at the Siteman Cancer Center on the campus of Washington University. one of the premier cancer focus centers in the country. Washington University is where onethird of all research was done to understand the human genome. I have met with the Alzheimers Association and the American Cancer Association. I met with the family of a young man who lost his fight with cancer before he was 10 years old. His mom and dad formed the Super Sam Foundation to encourage other families and to encourage research. They were there with his sister representing the Super Sam Foundation. The Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment Disorders at the University of Missouri is another place where we are looking to see what we can do to intervene earlier and help solve problems. The new chancellor at the university. Hank Foley. was with me. as was the director of that center. Dr. Stephen Kanne. They are doing good work and will continue to do so. In Kansas City. I met with an organization. MRIGlobal. that is doing incredible work in the field of environmental and cancer research and is making a big difference. The head of that company. Thomas Sack. was there as we were talking about what they were doing and what they hoped to do. My hometown of Springfield is also the home location of the Alzheimers Association Missouri Chapter. I had a chance to talk with them. I also met with the people from the Alzheimers Association. the American Cancer Society. the American Diabetes Association. and I then went on to Southeast Missouri State University. another autism center that is working to figure out how we can deal with autism disorders. including early detection. I visited Truman State University in Kirksville. where I had the opportunity to learn more about the universitys efforts to create an interprofessional autism clinic. I was able to hear stories about how frustrated young researchers have been with just a 6.6percent increasethe first increase in 12 years. During that 12 years. the buying power of the research dollar went down by 20 percent. We restored a little of that 20 percent. The Federal Government has been involved in research at least since the founding of the Department of Agriculture in 1862. Whether it is health care research or ag research or environmental research or energy research. there is a level of that research which should and will be done by the private sector. but there is another level of research by the Federal Government that benefits everybody by sharing the results of that research. In mental health. there is a lot of excitement in Missouri and around the country about the potential of being one of the pilot States in excellence of mental health. Senator STA3ENOW from Michigan and I introduced legislation a few years ago that would combinethat would treat behavioral health. treat mental health just like all other health. This is another way to save money. because of that mental health situation. By the way. the National Institutes of Health says that one out of four adult Americans has a diagnosable and almost always treatable mental health issue. If that mental health issue is being treated. whatever your other health issues are. they are likely to be treated in a much more effective way. We are looking for more choices to deal with the issues suffered by our Vietnam veterans to our youngest veterans. giving them more options and more choices. Eight States are going to be doing that and 24 States have applied. Senator STA3ENOW and I will be talking more about what happens and what we might do to encourage those other 16 States. The President says he wants to spend more money on mental health. It really doesnt matter how you share your mental health information or what your provider last told you or how many mental health care providers you have if there is no place to go and if there are no access points to treat behavioral health like all other health issues. and that is what excellence in mental health does for patients. I will close with one final area. I think there has been a lot of response to understanding and addressing the opioid epidemic and the drug issue. Deaths from prescription opioids and other painrelated drugs quadrupled between 1999 and 2013. claiming more than 145.000 lives over the past 10 years. but a substantial portion of those deaths occurred over the last couple of years. These overdoses cost the economy an estimated $20 billion in medical costs and lost work productivity. Some people die from overdosing. and many other people have to be treated by their health care provider. There is a personal loss to those individuals who become addicted to prescription drugs. I mentioned that I had a chance to talk to the Missouri General Assembly last week. and I talked about how our veterans are often the victims just because of the serious injuries they sustain and the painkilling drugs they are given to help deal with the pain of those injuries. But that then leads to an addiction to that drug and other drugs. Approximately three out of four new heroin users abused prescription drugs before switching to heroin. We have made a new commitment to this issue with new programs that are targeted to combat opioid abuse at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration with almost three times the investment that the country made before. This is truly becoming an epidemic. and we need to deal with that epidemic sooner rather than later. Many of our Members and their States have talked effectively about fighting heroin and drug addiction but also about dealing with the transition from taking drugs that they were prescribed to drugs that they shouldnt have. We are looking at new opportunities there. The new Republicanled Senate is looking at how to deal with these opportunities in new ways. I hope we havent made those successes for the spending year we are in now a onetime only event but a new commitment to try to solve the problems early so that society and the programs which taxpayers fund arent overwhelmed by those problems later. I yield the floor.
1140076806,"Mr. President. recent developments in North Korea should have raised serious concern. As we have heard over and over again in the Senate from Members of both parties. they have raised serious concerns. This weekend North Korea launched its latest socalled satellite into orbit. We know this was nothing but an attempt to conceal their development of ballistic missile programs that would actually check launch capability. not really launching a satellite. On January 6. North Korea claims to have tested a hydrogen bomb. which. if true. would significantly increase and advance its nuclear capabilities. Even if not true. they have significant weapons in what everyone in the world would understand to be dangerous and even unstable hands. In October 2014. the senior U.S. commander on the Korean Peninsula told reporters that North Korea has the capabilities to put together a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can be mounted on a ballistic missile. Now we see them continuing to check that launch and missile capability. They already tested atomic nuclear weapons in 2006. 2009. and in 2013. in all cases in violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and. frankly. in violation of the agreements they had made in the early part of 2003 and 2004. Nuclear experts have reported that North Korea may currently have as many as 20 nuclear warheads and that the capital. Pyongyang. has the potential to possess as many as 100 warheads within the next 5 years. Combined with what appears to be growing sophistication in their missile technology. they have been seeking a way to represent a direct threatsomething potentially disastrous in a nuclear wayto the United States and certainly to our allies in the region. They have shown capacity to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology to other dangerous regimes and. we have every reason to believe. dangerous individuals. U.S. officials recently connected Iranian officials to North Korea and specifically mentioned two Iranians who. according to the report. ""have been critical to the development of the 80ton rocket booster. and both traveled to Pyongyang"" to work on this. According to reports. Iran might coincidentally conduct a nuclear launch later this month. Now we see Iran doing what it is doing. and we see Korea with the capacity to do what it is doing. Frankly. what we see in both cases. as well as Russia. are economies that are faltering. and people have every reason to wonder about those in charge of their government. The more that occurs. the more dangerous a government might be in an unstable country. trying to do everything they can to enemies they feel they need to defend themselves against and people they need to advance against. We also know they have significantly increased their cyber capabilities. We continually hear from our intelligence community that a cyber threat is one of the greatest threats we face. We saw North Korea launch a cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014. which did incredible damage in many ways. including their ability to disrupt the critical infrastructure of our country in the same way they were able to get involved in the cyber world of one major company. According to a November 2015 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""North Korea is emerging as a significant actor in cyberspace with both its military and clandestine organizations gaining the ability to conduct cyber operations."" When we look at North Koreas attempts to increase and/or exaggerate the potential they have with the weapons they have or their ability to develop those weapons and when we look at what North Korea is doing with their cyber activities. we see a continually growing threat. The bill brought to the floor from Senator GARDNERS and Senator CORKERS committee. the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act. takes steps by providing the tools necessary to hold North Korea and its enablers accountable for what they do. The bills overall goal is to peacefully disarm North Korea through mandatory sanctions that would deprive the regime of the means to build its nuclear and ballistic missile program and advance its malicious cyber activities. Specifically. it mandates sanctions against individuals who have materially contributed to North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile development. individuals who have engaged in money laundering. the manufacture of counterfeit goods. or narcotics trafficking that would benefit those programs. and individuals who have engaged in significant activities undermining cyber security against the United States or foreign individuals. In addition to these sanctions. the legislation targets additional areas that would deny North Korea the resources it needs to continue its malicious activities. For example. the bill mandates sanctions on individuals involved in trading minerals and metals that could be part of a nuclear program. This section would send a strong message. certainly to China. North Koreas chief diplomatic protector and largest trading partner. The things that could be used as sanctions would surely make China think twice about what they are doing with North Korea but also think twice about what North Korea is doing with the world. China purports to have a significant influence in North Korea. China purports to not want to see nuclear destabilization occur. This bill would be an incentive for China to live up to those claims. It has consistently failed to leverage its political or economic influence up until now. If China is getting serious about getting North Korea to change its behavior. we would like to see that happen. In a new view of sanctions. there is a waiver in this bill. as there has traditionally been. The President of the United States will have a waiver of these penalties. But this waiver is much stronger from the legislative perspective in that the President can only use the waiver on a specific basis and has to report. as I understand it. what that basis is. This measure also goes beyond the traditional sanctions regime because it requires the administration to put forth a comprehensive strategy to promote improved implementation and enforcement of how these sanctions would work and what they would do to combat North Koreas cyber activities. to promote and encourage international engagement on North Korean human rights violations. and to report back to Congress on what they found. There can be no doubt that other wouldbe nuclear regimes are going to be watching this carefully. We saw the lack of appreciation for U.S. commitment in the early weeks and months of the unfortunate Iranian deal. Frankly. the Iranians should and will look back at 2003 and 2004 and wonder why the agreements with North Korea didnt work and wonder if we are committed to those agreements and wonder if we still are determined to stop North Korea when we see the kind of activities we see today. This begins to send that message. but the required implementation and reports will send that message in more aggressive ways than the Congress and consequently the country have before. Finally. we need to ensure that all U.S. forces deployed in the region are appropriately equipped with the most uptodate surveillance and counterballistic missile platforms. Our regional alliesparticularly South Korea and Japanneed to be assured that the United States is committed to both the stability and defense of all our partners and interests in the region. South Korea and Japan should also be encouraged to undertake any selfdefense measures that are necessary to augment American forces already in the region. North Korea remains a serious threat to peace and stability in the region and the world. North Korea continues to be a bad example of what happens when the United States makes agreements and isnt prepared to follow through on those agreements. The world is watching. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending a clear message that North Koreas provocations are not acceptable and that its continuing pursuit of illicit nuclear weapons will not be tolerated. We will get a chance to vote on that issue today. I hope we send a strong message. I hope the administration becomes a stronger partner in this message than the messages we are failing to send right now on Iran. I think this is an important moment for the country and the world."
1140081044,"Mr. President. today the Senate is taking a second step to deal with a public health crisis that is destroying lives and damaging communities across the Nation. the epidemic of opioid and heroin abuse. Step 1 late last year was to reduce spending in other programs and increase the dollars available to deal with this addiction. An estimated 1.9 million American adults have an opioiduse addiction or disorder related to prescription drug pain relievers. Another 500.860 have an opioiduse disorder related to heroin. Some 2.5 million Americans are dealing with this problem. Our Nations veterans are particularly at risk for developing a dependency on opioids. A study published in 2014 found a high prevalence of chronic pain among veterans because of their service. The chronic pain among veterans was 44 percent compared to 26 percent in the general public. There was a higher prevalence of opioid use. at 15.1 percent. in the U.S. military after a combat deployment. after possible injuries in training or injuries from an IED attack. compared to just 4 percent in the general public. In 2014. more than 1.000 Missourians died from an opioid overdose. In St. Louis alone. deaths related to opioid abuse have increased nearly three times since Member after member has come to the floor. just as they came to me last year as the chairman of the funding committee for health and human services and explained what a problem this is in their State. The majority leader made a point to me the other day that in Kentucky more people died last year from drug overdoses than died from car accidents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 4 people every day die from an overdose of opioid pain relievers. and 78 people die every day from a combination of pain reliever overdoses or heroin overdose. Many times those prescription opioids have been the pathway to heroin. Deaths from prescription opioids have quadrupled in the past 14 years. These are stunning statistics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has rightly labeled this an ""epidemic."" This should get a good vote on the Senate floor today or tomorrow. But just because it gets a good vote. it does not mean it was not an important debate to have. Just because it gets a good vote and is now better funded than it has been in the past. that does not mean the Senate and the House dont need to weigh in and say: Here is more specific ability to deal with these problems in new ways. The good news is that addiction is a treatable disease. Those who receive treatment can recover and go on to lead full. healthy. and productive lives. In Missouri 72 percent of the individuals who had gone through our States opioid treatment program in random tests test drugfree. The problem with addiction is that only about 10 percent of individuals who are battling drug addiction receive treatment. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. That is why it is important that we commit ourselves to win the fight against addiction. We need to make sure that all of the stakeholders are involved. As to first responders. if you are a first responder attached to a fire department. for instance. the odds are that you are going to respond to three times as many drug overdoses as you do to fires. So whether it is first responders. paramedics. or the law enforcement community. we need to use all of our resources to try to be sure that we are doing what needs to be done here. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that we are debating provides grants from multiple government agencies to encourage State and local communities to pursue strategies that we know work. The only thing you have to do is be sure and implement those strategies. The bill expands the educational efforts to understand addiction as a chronic illness. That promotes treatment and recovery and prevents opioid abuse from going forward. The bill also expands resources to identify and to treat the incarcerated population suffering from addiction disorders with evidencebased treatment. Finally. it expands disposal sites for unwanted prescription medications to help them out of the hands of children and adolescents. Way too many unused painkillers are still in peoples medicine cabinets or their dresser drawer. waiting for somebody else to find them and. once they know they are there. to find them again. This bill represents a strong bipartisan effort to address this epidemic. I filed two amendments that I think will improve the bill. I hope to see them in the managers package. The first amendment will just simply expand the efforts that we have already made in a bill that Senator STABENOW and I introduced a couple of years ago and that got a significant pilot project in the Excellence in Mental Health Act. What that does is to provide 24hour access for people living with behavioral health issueswith mental health issues. That would include substance abuse disorder. Excellence in Mental Health creates a demonstration program that really just simply. in the right kind of facilities. requires that mental health is dealt with like all other healththat behavioral health is dealt with like all other health. When we started that debate. there was a belief that no more than 20 States would implement Excellence in Mental Health if every State in the country were allowed to do it if they wanted to. We now have 24 States that have applied to be one of the eight State pilots. The administration said: Why dont we increase the 8 States to 14 States? We have an amendment to this bill that would say: Lets go ahead and increase the 14 States to all 24 States. because not only is this the right thing to do but what these States will find out is that when you deal with mental health like all other health. you probably save money because the other health issues that people with behavioral health issues have are so much more easily dealt with. It has been long said that we have really turned over. in an outrageous way. the mental health obligations of our society to the local police departments and the emergency rooms. That is no way to do this. It is no way to solve this problem. We are about 50 years behind. We are beginning now to catch up in the ways we should. I also filed an amendment to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to use telehealth to allow this program to work more effectively. to allow telehealth to be one of the specifically reimbursable opportunities here. According to the Centers for Disease Control. individuals in rural communities are more likelynot as likely. not less likely. but more likelyto overdose on prescription painkillers than people in the cities. people in urban areas. In fact. death rates from overdoses in rural areas now greatly outpace the rate in large metropolitan areas. which historically had higher rates. So what do you do to connect those individuals with the kind of help they might need on a basis that they can turn to that help when they need to? One way to do that. certainly. is telehealth treatment options. Telehealth allows individuals in rural or medically underserved areasmany of whom just simply dont have other treatment optionsto receive the care they need. to receive the attention their issue needs remotely. Additionally. telehealth can be an important component in ensuring that those patients receiving treatment for pain management use opioids effectively and appropriately and dont get started down the wrong path and the wrong way. In July 2014. the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study that followed patients who reported moderate to intense chronic musculoskeletal pain. Of the 250 patients in the study. half received the normal standard of care and half received a year of telephone monitoring in addition to normal care. Patients who were monitored via telehealth were twice as likely to report less pain after 12 months. having someone to talk to or being able to ask a question about whether they should increase the medicine because their pain was worse that day. Researchers have clearly noted that fewer telehealth patients started taking escalated doses of opioids than people who were simply taking medicine on their own. Telehealth holds promise in lots of areas. I believe this happens to be one of them. As chairman of the Labor. Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee. I was proud to see us increase funding at a 284percent increase. I will say again that we did that by cutting funding in other areas. One of the things the government has to start doing is to truly prioritize. If everything is a priority. nothing is a priority. Today. with this piece of legislation. the Senate is telling our friends on the other side of the Capitol and around the country that this is an epidemic we intend to deal with. I look forward to the continuation of this debate. the end of this debate. and passing this bill. Thank you. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140086849,Mr. President. I ask my colleagues to support the Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2016. S. 2755. This bipartisan legislation will create a program to provide Capitolflown flags to the immediate family members of firefighters. law enforcement officers. members of rescue squads or ambulance crews. and public safety officers who are killed in the line of duty. These flags are provided at no cost to the family and will come with a certificate from the Senate. signed by the providing Member and President pro tempore. which contains our expression of sympathy for the grieving family. Certificates coming from the other body will be signed by the Speaker of the House and the providing House Member and express the sympathy of the House of Representatives. I hope all my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation. Our first responders make tremendous sacrifices for our communities. If one of them makes the ultimate sacrifice. the least we can do to recognize their life. show our gratitude. and express our sympathy for their family is present them with a flag flown over this building. Under existing rules. Senate offices may not use official funds to send flags to individuals. This legislation authorizes a new program. administered by the Architect of the Capitol. that will make it possible for families who have lost a loved one in these circumstances to request and receive a Capitolflown flag at no expense. We are all grateful for the sacrifices these dedicated public servants make every day to serve and protect our communities. and this legislation will make it possible to present grieving families with a symbol of our gratitude. This legislation has been endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of Police and the Sergeants Benevolent Association. I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in the RECORD following my statement. I would like to thank all my colleagues who cosponsored this legislation. particularly our ranking member of the Rules Committee. Senator SCHUMER. I would also like to thank Congressman PETER KING. who has championed this cause in the other body for many years. This legislation includes some revisions to the previously passed version in the House. but I expect they will be agreeable to the other body. I hope both bodies will pass this legislation quickly and send it on to the President for his signature. Thank you.
1140096568,Mr. President. I mentioned what incredible leadership Mr. ALEXANDER. the Senator from Tennessee. provides on these issues. I was pleased. as he was pleased. and I know the Presiding Officer was also. that last year. for the first time in 12 years. we were able to have an increase in NIH research. The future statistics that the Senator from Tennessee talked about on Alzheimers and other things can be disrupted. In fact. that 2050 number of twice the defense budget spent on Alzheimers alone with tax moneyif you could delay the onset of Alzheimers by an average of 5 years. you would reduce that number by 42 percent. So those research dollars not only have the impact we want to have on families and the individuals involved in that and other diseases we are dealing with now but also have an incredible impact on taxpayers. have an incredible impact on what we can do with the rest of the health care revolution that is occurring. The mental health effort the Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. and I were able to work on together a few years ago is about to produce at least eight Statesand hopefully morewhere. at the right kinds of facilities. mental health will be treated just like all other health. This Congress is talking about doing the right things. We are making important steps in that direction. Mr. President. I want to talk today about another thing that really impacts familiesin this case. military families. I have this bill on my desk. the National Defense Authorization Act. I notice it is only on the desk of half of the Members of the Senate. Members on this side of the floor are ready to get to this bill and get this work done. Maybe there is a message on the other side of the floor that this bill is not there. We had hoped to get to it this week. We have not yet. But certainly we should get to it as soon we return to our work after the end of this week. In the National Defense Authorization ActI am really glad that bill includes the Military Family Stability Act. a measure that I introduced with Senator GILLIBRAND to provide more flexibility for military families. Today we have the most powerful military in the world. but we also recognize that our military men and women do not serve alone. The former Chief of Staff of the Army. GEN Ray Odierno. often said that the strength of our Nation is in our military. but the strength of our military is in its families. So our military families need to be understood. recognized. appreciated. helped. Those families have changed a lot over the years. They have sacrificed much. In the last 15 years. those families have dealt with persistent conflicts somewhere in the world and the likelihood of deployment to that conflict. But more importantly. the stress that puts on those families generally is what matters to themmaybe not more importantly in the greater context of what is going on but very important to them. More military spouses are working today than ever before. In the world we live in today. this is good news. But all too often. military spouses sacrifice their own careers to meet the needs of the spouse who is in the service. Frequent redeployments. frequent deployments. and frequent relocations really have an impact on those careers. According to a study done by the Military Officers Association of America. 90 percent of military spousesthat is more than 600.000 men and womenare either unemployed or underemployed. More than half cite the concerns about their spouses service and the deterrent of moving from job to joba deterrent not only for employers but a deterrent in that they sometimes have a hard time having the kind of recognition for the skills they bring to a new State or a new location that they need. It is unfair to our military families for the spouse to needlessly have problems that could be avoided. Clearly. if you decide to pursue a military careerand that. by necessity. means relocation from time to timethis is not going to be the same career as if you went to work and you had every likelihood that you would work there for the next several years. These frequent and sometimes abrupt relocations take a heavy toll on students as well. Research shows that students who move at least six times between the 1st and 12th grades are 35 percent more likely to fail a grade. I am not sure that exact research applies to military families. That is an overall number of what happens when people move. But the average military family will move six to nine times during a childs time in schoolthree times more often than the nonmilitary family. These relocations of military families means that we need to find a better way to deal with those challenges for working families. and the Military Family Stability Act does that. The costs of needlessly maintaining two residences so that someone can finish school or someone can complete a job are the kinds of things that this act and this inclusion in the National Defense Authorization Act gives us a chance to deal with in a different way. It would allow families to either stay at the current duty station for up to 6 months longer than they otherwise would be able to stay or to leave and go to a new location sooner. This probably is most easily understood in the context of school. If you only have a month left in school and your family could stay there while the person serving in the military goes ahead to the next post and is responsible for their own housing during the time they are there as a single serving individualoften they are going to find space available on the post itself for one person while the family stays until that school year works out better. A job could be the same. One person we had who came and testifiedMia. who now lives in Rolla. MOis married to a soldier who was being reassigned from Hawaii to Fort Leonard Wood. MO. That reassignment was supposed to occur in June. so she applied for a Ph.D. program at St. Louis University that would begin in August. She applied for a teaching position at Missouri Science and Technology at Rolla that would begin in August. Then her husbands transfer did not happen in June and it did not happen in July. but she needed to be there in August. Under this change. moving the family household could easily occur in August and her husband could follow in October. as he did. but all of the expense of her going early was on her. She really had two options: One was to not pursue her graduate school class when it started. and the other was to not have a teaching job. Neither of those was a very good option. She went ahead and moved. Her husband essentially couchsurfed. but they had to pay for the move rather than the way that normally would have happened. This would not have to happen otherwise. When Senator GILLIBRAND and I introduced this bill last year. we were also joined by Elizabeth OBrien. who coached Division 1 college basketball for 11 years. with stints at West Point. Hofstra University. and the University of Hawaii. But she married into the Army. and because of the lack of flexibility. she gave up her coaching career. The story she wanted to tell that day was that when she and her family were in Germany. where her husband was serving. her two children were in a German public school. They needed 2 more months to finish that year in the German public school. There really wasnt a very good transition when he was sent back to the Pentagon. There were no German public schools where they could have finished the classes in the Washington area. Basically. they wound up having to finish that year as home schoolers and then start another year the next year. It would have been very easy for him to move on ahead. if that is what the family wanted to do. and for the family to stay in Germany for 2 months so the children could finish that school year in a way that it couldnt possibly be finished anywhere else. and then the family would move. That is the kind of thing that would happen under this legislation. The day after we introduced this legislation. I happened to be hosting a breakfast for people who are supportive of Fort Leonard Wood and working at Fort Leonard Wood. I sat down at a table with two officers. One of their wives. a retired master sergeant. mentioned that we had proposed this legislation the day before. All three of them immediately had a story about how this would have benefited their family if at some time at a specific moment in their career. they could have stayed another 30 days or if the family could have gone forward 30 days earlier. I am proud this bill has widespread support. including from the National Military Family Association. the Military Officers Association of America. the Military Child Education Coalition. Veterans of Foreign Wars. the American Legion. Iraq And Afghanistan Veterans of America. Blue Star Families. the National Guard Association. and the Veterans Support Foundation. After more than a decade of active engagement around the world. frankly. at a time when military families have a lot more challenges than military families may have had at an earlier time. this is exactly what we ought to do. We have had hearings on other issues over the last year. Over and over again. I have asked people who were testifying. representing the military. what they think about this. Usually these are admirals and general officers. In all cases. a story from their career immediately comes to mind. Universally. they say: We have to treat families different than we used to treat families because too often the failure to do that means we are losing some of our most highly skilled people. who are still willing to serve but are no longer willing to put an unnecessary burden on their spouse or their children. The Military Family Stability Act goes a long way toward removing one of those unnecessary burdens. I am certainly pleased to see it included in the National Defense Authorization Act and look forward to dealing with this important bill at the earliest possible date. I see Senator ISAKSON on the floor. and I yield to him.

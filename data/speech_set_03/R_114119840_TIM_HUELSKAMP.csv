1140003579,"Thank you. Congressman. I know we probably sound like a broken recordand for the marchers coming in tomorrow. that is something that they used before there were CDs. Isnt that greatwe have all of these marchers coming in who dont even know what a record is because they are so young. In the battle for life. we are winning with this generation. They understand the reality of when life begins. I am so thankful for that. and I am so thankful for CHRIS SMITHs leadership. Like one of my earlier colleagues. I remember being on the other side of the rally watching the Congressman and saying: Gosh darnit. I wish I could be like him. What can I do? That is what I would like to talk about tonight: What can we do to make a difference? Of course. as we will see tomorrow. a tremendous level of political involvement with tens. perhaps hundreds of thousands of folks showing up here from all over the country. Generally you have people from Kansas to lead the march. and it is great to see some kids from Benedictine College and throughout my district as well getting involved. making a difference. both here in Washington and in their State capital. coming here for the March for Life. which we hashtagged ""Why We March."" What else can we do? Very quickly. we can help and assist women and families in crisis pregnancies. There are hundreds and hundreds of facilities across the country that offer free help and free care. outreach for those in very difficult situations. We can do that. The second thing we can do is encourage families. current families. encourage marriage. Marriage is a founding block of our society. of our civilization. The more we can encourage marriage. the more we can encourage families and the more we can help our unborn. We can also consider adoption. For those who are listening today who are wondering. maybe that should be for mesometimes it might be one spouse. Sometimes it might be another. I was with a couple of friends this weekend just talking about that. saying. think about it. pray about it. consider it. because there are literally tens of thousands. hundreds of thousands of young folks who are looking for homes. So please consider that. And lastly. I ask. please pray for the unborn. please pray for birth families. and please pray for those who are considering adoption. Lastly. I want to briefly thank the four birth families who blessed our family with children. Some of them I know. some of them I do not. Two of them are in foreign countries and two of those families are here in this country. But that is a tough decision. I am so thankful for the men and women of this country that chose life and offered up their children for adoption."
1140022685,Mr. Speaker. I want to tell you about a brave lady named Ellie. whom I met a few years ago in Kansas. This is her story. One Tuesday morning. back in 1973. she opened up her local newspaper to read about a U.S. Supreme Court decision that shocked her. outraged her. and saddened her. She questioned how a small group of unelected judges could reach such a tragic and illegitimate decision in the name of constitutional rights. That case was the fateful Roe v. Wade decision that mandated abortion on demand throughout all 50 States for all 9 months of pregnancy. In response to the Courts ruling. Ellie rushed out to the nearest abortion clinic. Expecting other outraged Kansans to already be there. Ellie found herself alone. No one else was there. It seemed that the Supreme Court. in faroff Washington. had imposed its radical decision on Ellie and an entire Nation without anyone noticing. few caring. and no one responding about the lives of the unborn. As history does report. that seemingly deafening silence didnt stay that way. Soon. Ellie was joined by others. many others. Contrary to the expectations of the elite lawyers on the Supreme Court. their decision did not shortcircuit or end the debate over abortion. rather. over the following years. it ignited the debate. While the Court still stubbornly clings to the ruling. science has exposed its folly. Legal scholars recognize its defects. Most importantly. public opinion. from the young to the old. has passed them by. Today. an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose an overwhelming percentage of all abortions. Today. the Supreme Court may be tempted to repeat that same mistake. They may be emboldened to impose again a socalled 50State solution on the entire Nation. By radically attempting to redefine marriage for Ellie and the entire country by invalidating centuries of marriage laws and by silencing the more than 50 million Americansthat is 50 million Americanswho have voted to protect marriage as between one man and one woman. this court would. once again. be repeating their arrogant mistake of misreading both the American public and our American Constitution. Unlike 1973. I believe that Americans are already beginning to engage on this issue. This time. Ellie will not be alone. If this Supreme Court attempts to shred again another foundational aspect of our society. there will be a strong. quick. and ferocious response. for a small group of lawyers should not impose their redefinition of marriage on every single American State. every single American citizen. every single American family. and every single American church and synagogue. Therefore. I implore this Court to learn from the Roe v. Wade mistake. do its job. read and obey the Constitution. and correctly affirm that Ellie and the citizens of every one of our united States are free to affirm or restore marriage as the union of one man and one woman.
1140022827,I appreciate my colleague from Georgia yielding me time to discuss this rule and the underlying issue. I do want to report that it was 229 years ago that the Virginia General Assembly ratified the Virginia statute for religious freedom. This was authored by Thomas Jefferson. The statute serves as the model for the free exercise clause in our First Amendment. This is what it said: No man shall . . . suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief. but that all men shall be free to profess. and by argument. to maintain. their opinions in matters of religion. Mr. Speaker. religious freedom is a fundamental human right protected by our First Amendment. It is essential to our free and flourishing society. Our Nation was found. in part. by individuals seeking refuge from religious persecution. from religious discrimination. For these pioneers and for all to come after. America was meant to be a permanent fortress of liberty and freedom for all who live within its walls. At its essence. the concept of religious freedom is about much more than religion. It is much more than just showing up to worship service 1 day or 1 night a week. It is about our fundamental human right to hold our own beliefs and to live out our lives according to these faiths. Religious freedom. quite simply. is about freedom itself. This is why the very first part of the very First Amendment to our Constitution is about religious freedom. It is our first and most cherished liberty. However. our ability to be free to live out the convictions of our faith not only in the public square. but also in the privacy of our own homes. in our churches. in our businesses. is in jeopardy right here in our Nations Capital. The misleading name RHNDA is nothing more than a legalized discrimination. If allowed to go in effect. the government would force prolife organizations. prolife ministries. prolife business. prolife churches. prolife individuals in the District to violate the very heart of their lives and their work and be coerced into paying for abortion on demand and be forced to hire antilife individuals who actually promote abortion. As a Catholic and as an American. I am offended by such coercion. Now is the time for Congress to stand up against this direct assault on our freedom of religion. our freedom of association. and our freedom of speech. I encourage my colleagues to join me and honor our constitutional oath of office by adopting this rule and passing H.J. Res. 43.
1140040992,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to visit tonight about a very radical decision. I appreciate the discussion of my colleagues from Texas and Iowa outlining some of the background. I was born in 1968. and what this Court would have us believe is that 100 years before I was born. somehow secretly written into this constitutional Amendment was language that invalidated laws in every State of the Union at that time. They want us to believe the authors of this constitutional Amendment. the 14th Amendment. violated their own State laws at the time and just didnt know it. That is silly. That is utter nonsense. And only if you lived in Washington. D.C.. in some bubble and spent your weekends or your summers vacationing in Western Europe. not in western Kansas where I am from. could you dream up somehow the Constitution dictated that you would overrule. override. undothis is five unelected black robe attorneys that are going to dictate to 50 million Americans that you are wrong on the definition of marriage. You are wrong. 2.000 years of human history is wrong. The authors of the 14th Amendment were wrong. and 31 States are wrong. Let me go through that. We are talking about dozens and dozens of States that adopted by a vote of the people. Again. lets roll back 2 years ago in the Winter decision. This same Court. the exact same Court. said: Do you know what? It is up to the States to decide. They actually declared themselves wrong 2 years previous to that and set to deny the vote. the right to vote to shortcircuit the democratic process. Now recognize. folks have strong opinions. Even the President of the United StatesPresident Obama and I both agree on this point. there are strong opinions on both sides. but what is happening here is the folks that cant win in the State of Kansas. cant win in 30 other States. have decided that they are going to try to find five people. five people to overrule 50 million. Let me give you an example. My home State of Kansas. when we passed our Kansas marriage amendment. which I was proud to be the author of. 417.675 men and women voted to declare that marriage is only between a man and a woman. Five lawyers across the street said. You are all wrongevery one of them. You go to the State of California. in 2008. 7.001.084 Californians were declared to be wrong by five people across the street. five people who have already fled town. They have left town. They wont even stay here. they dont even show up in public. They go behind closed doors. make up their mind. come out. and rule. This is exactly what our Founders were afraid of with judicial tyranny of folks trying to dictate. to mandate. take their personal biases. and mandate them on California. mandate themlet me pick a State at randomthe State of Maine. 300.848 folks in Maine. How about in Alaska? 152.965 people that these 5 people said were wrong. Total across the entire Nation. there were 51.483.777 people that this court. these 5 people. not the entire court. 5 people decided you 51.483.777 people. you are wrong. Those five were wrong 2 years agoor at least one of them was wrong. They changed their mind 2 years ago. If you look at the Holy Fathers latest encyclical that has been much discussed. it talks about the rule of law and how if you start violating laws that becomes a patternand here. we have a pattern of this Court deciding to ignore the clear Constitution and decide to impose their biases. As I understand. the dissent was frightening. This is not only imposing their biases against traditional marriage. these five people dont like marriage as 51 million Americans understand that. In the dissent. it talked about not only that. they have opened the door to plural unions. and it is coming. They referenced a Court case. This is where this Court is headed. and it is totally out of step. not only with 51 million Americans. but with their own Court decision 2 years ago. but also with the whole idea of our Constitution. that somehow it is living and breathing and then five people. I mean. this is the same margin by which we have had atrocious decisions throughout history of this country. You go not far from thisand my colleague from Iowa knows thisyou go not far from here. you go down. I think it is a floor down. where you had a decision by the same U.S. Supreme Court. just a few different folks. decided certain people didnt have rights and made a decision. an atrocious decision. They were wrong. I think the Court is wrong today. Again. the idea that somehow they know better is the elitism that I think is driving folks crazy. and it is not just on this issue. My colleague from Iowa has pointed out. again and again. it is concerns about immigration. it is concerns about education. it is concerns about spending. about overregulation where you have folks inside a bubble in Washington. D.C.. they read every week. Every day. I guess. they read the New York Times and think they are doing a great job. they read The Washington Post. but they dont read and listen to real Americans. Again. they travel and vacation in western Europe. Many times. we see them using Court decisions in the arguments that have no basis not only in our jurisprudence. but in our history and are using that which is outsideI have never served in the U.S. Senate. I probably never will. and I have no desire to do that. but I have got to wonder. when each of these five that decided to overrule 51 million. did anybody ask them: Do you think you are smarter than the rest of America? Did anybody ask them? Actually. when they did ask them. they said: We cant tell you how we are going to rule. There is no doubt that at least four. perhaps five. of these judges. these attorneys. these lawyers made up their mind before they got the case and said: This is the decision. Here is what we want to reach. Here is the outcome. Lets make something up so we can at least claim there is an argument. There is no logical argument. there is no legal argument. All there is. is the utter power. the claim that we get to dictate what the rest of America will accept. As a prolife American as well. we have to go 42 years ago. A court tried to do the same thing. And at that time. in 73. and I am guessing January 24. 1973. I was a little tyke. Thank goodness I was born before the Roe v. Wade generation. I saw some of those folks run around today. claiming they were part of that generation. Part of that generation. onethird of those are gone. At that time. the Court said they were going to impose abortion on all of America through all 9 months. Do you know what. they walked away and said: We got it all done. What they found out is the American people are resilient. When they see outrageous decisions like this. it might take them weeks. it might take them months. it might take them a year. it might take them decades. but they will be pushing back. They will be pushing back and demanding that. when you put your thumb into the eye of 51 million Americans. you put your thumb in the eye of 2.000 years of history. you put your thumb in the eye of millions of millions of children that deserve a dad and a mom. a married dad and a mom. and say: Do you know what. you dont count. you dont count. That is what this Court is saying. We spend billions of dollars every year trying to replace a mom and a dad. Here we are today because of five people across the streetagain. five people deciding for the rest of us. This was not interpretation of the Constitution. this was just utter legal nonsense. There are two ways to respond to this. One is a Federal marriage amendment. I have introduced that a couple sessions in a row. That is the way you amend the Constitution. The way the left amends the Constitution is they get five votes. Folks have been worried about a constitutional convention. and I always joke that. well. they have one every time they issue a ruling. This one was a constitutional convention. utter legal fiction and nonsense. They know it. they all know this. They are probably drinking cocktails tonight. laughing about our comments on the floor saying: Well. yeah. everybody knows that. So we are just under some fiction. We are trying to figure out. okay. here is the decision we want. here is how we get there. A Federal marriage amendment is one option. but that is difficult. A second one that we have to worry aboutand it was noted in the oral arguments. it was noted in the opinion of the majority and the minority. because of this decision. mark my words. mark the words of the dissentersis they will use this decision to attack religious liberties of Americans who still believe. 51 million and plenty of others. that marriage is between a man and a woman. They are not going to stop. Ten years ago. they said they would stop at civil unions. That was all they wanted. then. well. maybe want something else. Now. it is not only do they want marriage. the next one will be to say. if you disagree with me. you not only have to bake a cake. you have to participate in other ceremonies in other ways. It goes on and on. That is why I have introduced. along with others. the First Amendment Defense Act. which I call upon those who believe in marriage. and even if you dont believe in marriage but believe in the supremacy of the American people rather than five attorneys. we bring that to the floor and defend the rights and liberties of Americans and the thousands. perhaps tens of thousands. perhaps millions of churches that say. Do you know what. we dont agree with that. and we will not have the Federal Government imposing their waythese five people. Now. I am just one. We got 435 in this body. 100 in the other body. and the Court just said: Do you know what. that doesnt matter. That is the definition of tyranny. and from tyranny. good things do not come. Our Founders understood that. When you consolidate powerand as my colleague said: What difference does Congress make anymore? The decision the day before suggested they get to rewrite the law. and the marriage decision was they get to rewrite the Constitution. This is a fundamental decision on the history of our country. the history of our Constitution. where the future goes. and the history for and the future for our children. I appreciate my colleague from Iowa. his efforts for many years. I will not apologize on behalf of 417.675 Kansans who voted for marriage. If those five Justices are asking them to apologize. they will not. They will continue to defend Gods lawful marriage. and they will do that proudly and will continue to defend the State. and our U.S. Congress should do the same. I appreciate my colleague from Iowas leadership. These are one of these things that it is not easy. Congressman. I appreciate your leadership on this and not giving up for the right thing.
1140041001,you brought up about diluting the institution of marriage. and if we keep going down this path. it will be worth nothing. If we keep diluting the value of our money. it is worth nothing. and if we keep diluting the value of the things that have made our society great. the nucleus family. if we keep doing that. it becomes more washed out. Roughly 2 weeks ago the Supreme Courts 54 decision on Obergefell v. Hodges demonstrated yet again the highest court in the land legislating from the bench. The ruling was disappointing not only for the fact that the court had not four States to redefine marriage. but even more so because it removes millions of American from the democratic process of choosing for themselves who and what defines marriage. I personally and millionsyou brought up 51 millionhold a traditional view of marriage between one man and one woman. And I am proud to say that I have been married to my wife Carolyn for over 40 years. God bless her because we know that is a tough job. However. the Constitution grants people. the voters. the ability to decide whether or not to recognize samesex marriage. Chief Justice Roberts in his dissent made a valid point. which I am sure is shared by many Americans. He said those who founded our country would not recognize the majoritys conception of the judicial role. And then he continued: They certainly would not have been satisfied by a system empowering judges to override policies. judgments. so long as they do so after a quiet extensive discussion. With this type of legislation from the bench. what is the point of the States rights. I think that is what this gets down to because 30 States wanted to define and have the right. according to the 10th Amendment. that it is a States rights issue. If you live in that State and they decide what marriage is and you dont like it. you have the freedom to move or challenge us through the State system. I think it is a sad day in America when we have to. as a country. redefine who we are as a Nation. we have to redefine what marriage is. an institution that has been around and ordained by God for over thousands of years. 2.000years plus. to come down to this point in our society. We have got a book that we have lived by. and I am going to hold this up for the viewers. This is. in total. the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. And you can see it is a very thin book. It is not epic in volume. but. yet. it is an epic in ideology of what a nation stands for. a nation of laws. We have the three branches of government. I have been up here for 21/2 years. and what I hear over and over again is we are in a constitutional crisis. And being in Congress for the last 21/2 years. I see a lot of dysfunctionality. And if we dont do our job. you get other branches of government fulfilling that job and overstepping their boundaries. I agree with Justice Antonin Scalia when he stated in his dissent: A system of government that makes the people subordinate to a committee of nonelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy. Wow. Those are powerful words. A system of government that makes the people subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy. We cannot allow our Constitution to be eroded. and I will continue to fight for the States rights and stop this continued Federal power grab. I look at Justice Roberts. some of the dissension in his ruling. and Roberts forcibly criticized the majority: Sidestepping the democratic process and declaring that samesex couples have the right to marry when. in his view. such a right has no basis in the Constitution. The courts decision. he complained. orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human societies for millennia. We are redefining that. And then he goes on to the Kalahari bushmen and to the Han Chinese. the Carthaginians. and the Aztecs. Just who. Roberts laments. do we think we are? The other three justices echoed Roberts sentiment. sometimes in even more strident terms. Justice Scalia characterized the decision as a judicial putsch and suggested that. before he signed on to an opinion like the majority. I would hide my head in a bag. This is from our Supreme Court justices. I think it is a sad state of affairs that. in the three branches of government. that we are out of balance. We. as Member of Congress. are the most powerful branch. It is the way our Founders set our country up. It is the longest living democracy and constitutional free republic in the world. The reason for that is the checks and balances. I would like. Mr. Speaker. to say to you and to my colleagues that our three branches of government are seriously out of balance. And at times during human history. when the government oversteps its boundaries. whether in total or in the different branches. and they overstep the boundaries of the Constitution. it is not only our duty. but it is our responsibility as Americans and as the peoples House in the United States of Congress to stand up and rein in government and hold those other branches accountable. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House floor to make sure that we are the ones that stand up and say: Enough is enough. We have had enough.

1140077114,Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment on a very important bill. and I appreciate the work of the gentleman from Texas. I believe the bill is necessary. My amendment. hopefully. will provide some additional information. As we know. Congress has the authority to set the debt limit. The President. through the Secretary of the Treasury. however. has the apparent authority to set the date to which all the cable networks peg their doomsday countdown clocks. We saw this firsthand in 2011 and 2013. Even if receipts. expenditures. or use of extraordinary measures change their internal projections of the exhaustion date. Treasury is not required in any way to provide regular. independently verifiable updates to Congress or the American people. Instead. the elected officials charged with making the ultimate decision on increasing the Nations maxedout credit card are expected to simply take Treasurys word for itsometimes months after an initial estimate. My proposed amendment is very simple. It would require that Treasury provide a weekly reporting of the extraordinary measures and the projected exhaustion date per our Nations debt limit. It is a matter of transparency. But it is also exactly the information we need as Members of Congress to fulfill our constitutional responsibility on this issue. Consider just how long the use of extraordinary measures lasted in 2015. They were originally utilized on March 15. yet the Treasury set November 3 as the date of exhaustionover 7 months later. That creates. I believe. a lot of uncertainty. and Treasury continues to control the entire process. Transparency is always a better policy. Mr. Chairman. to further illustrate why this is needed. just last week. a report was issued by the House Financial Services Committee that found that apparently the Department misled Congress regarding their capabilities and plans concerning debt payments back in 2011 and 2013. Without going into too much detail. the findings of the report. I believe. are clear. The Treasury did not report to Congress the specific actions they could take once the debt limit is reached. I urge the House to support my amendment to help ensure the American people and Congress are equipped to make informed judgments on this critical issue of the Federal debt limit. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140084990,Mr. Speaker. I appreciate my colleagues from Texas and across the Nation who. as I have discovered with this bill. have similar problems. In my particular case. it is the city of Salina. Kansas. which is located only 100 miles from the closest hub. and it has long provided valuable air service either to Kansas City or a little bit farther to Denver. Due to circumstances beyond Salinas control. just in January their air carrier stopped providing flights from Salina. and TSA obviously withdrew screening services. However. just a few weeks laterjust a few weeks laterthe airport and Great Lakes Airlines reached an exciting agreement to restore air service to and from Salina. As we have heard the same story. the airport sent a request to TSA asking them to reinstate screening servicesagain. this is just a few weeks after they had ended the servicesto begin these muchneeded flights. Shortly thereafter. without adequate explanation. TSA. of course as we have heard. denied the request. I soon learned from other airports. other communities across America that I wasnt alone. Other airports located predominantly in rural communities. in nearly identical situations. were also being denied screening services. Perhaps most troubling to meand I heard a lot of troubling testimony herewas that no credible reason was given for declining the screening services. again. just a few weeks after they were still screening flights in Salina. Kansas. saying we cant do it now. I believe our rural communities in Kansas and others across the Nation are tired of being left with the short end of the stick and Washington bureaucrats thinking they can get away with it. In response to these lame excuses. I urge passage of our TSA Fairness Act today. This legislation will reverse the denial by TSA and ensure they stop discriminating against rural communities like Salina. Kansas. The service agreement they have reached with Great Lakes Airlines will support our regions continued economic growth. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Growth. Tax and Capital Access. I understand how important reliable air service is for Salina. Kansas. and our region. It is a simple fix with this bill. I appreciate my colleague from Texas carrying this on the floor. It will ensure TSA continues to fulfill its mission. which is to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. and again for Salina and other rural communities across Kansas.

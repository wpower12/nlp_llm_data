1130004131,We had a historic occasion last evening. but I rise to comment on a number of issues. I first want to acknowledge and pay tribute to a Texan who was buried yesterday in a tragic incident. Chris Kyle. a Navy SEAL who had served this country. loved this country. and came back to his family and children and took as his cause to help serve troubled veterans. As he was doing so. along with his friend. Chad. one of those troubled veterans shot both him and his friend. What a tragedy. I think it is important to note the thousands who mourned him and the procession that took him to his burial ground yesterday and to say thank you for not only serving this Nation. but coming home to care about those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. That leads me to bring up this whole question of sequester. In my own city of Houston. I was able to. some 4 years ago. establish the first posttraumatic stress disorder center in a hospital that was not a veterans hospital. The Riverside General Hospital for a period of years continued serving our posttraumatic stress disorder veterans in a small. attentive setting where they could sit with others who were troubled as well. Ive become a champion of the needs and the purpose of posttraumatic stress disorder medical services and beg and cry to the Department of Veterans Affairs and to the Pentagon from where this grant came. We cannot abandon our soldiers who have served us well. And I would hope that the grant for this hospital will be continued because Texas has been known to have the largest number of returning Iraq and Afghanistan troops. Mr. Speaker. that speaks loudly to the question of sequester. Im delighted that the President last evening could not have offered more olive branches on economic reform and tax reform. His idea is that we can do this budget together. not a sequester and not a selfinflicted wound. which is what we did to ourselves. but. more importantly. to talk about innovation and growth. This is something that Ive spoken about over and over again as a member formerly of the Science Committee and now Homeland Security. Where is Americas genius? Right outside the beltway. Why are we dividing ourselves along Democrats and Republicans. refusing to put revenue alongside of cuts? Mr. Speaker. were at the bone. almost. and sequester that is acrosstheboard cuts will literally destroy us and put us in a recession. All the talking heads that are suggesting that the President was not bipartisan and how there was nothing that they heard. well. Mr. Speaker. may I ask them to take some cotton out of their ears. Because in actuality. the President extended his hand of friendship. We want to get down to work. We can pass comprehensive immigration reform. We can pass in tribute and recognition of Sandy Hook. Hadiya. and Aurora and our Congresswoman. our former colleague. Congresswoman Giffords. and Virginia Tech and many places. and Lone Star College in my district and the tragedy at the University of Maryland that just occurred in the last 24 hours. People are mourning. We have to stop gun violence. So I dont want to hear the fact that the President is divisive. The President is leading. and he has led well. The American people are listening. When are our friends on the other side of the aisle going to listen? And when are the American people going to raise up beyond the maze of television commentary and see that your voices can be heard? If you raise up literally in the houses of worship and civic clubs and say that Congress must do its job for our soldiers who are coming home and for those children who are the future and for the opportunity for growth. you bring down the debt by growing the economy and innovating. Congratulations. Mr. President. for the research and manufacturing centers15. Lets do more of them. I hope that we can get summer youth jobs. a program of private and public cooperation. When does a youth take up a gun? They take it up when they dont have a summer job and when they dont have an opportunity. So I want to challenge this body to be the kind of Lincolnesque attitude. as yesterday was the official birthday of President Lincoln. February 12. And although it was a tragic time in our history. I can assure you that it showed the greatest promise of America when people could come together and do something great. I stand here as a freed slave because this Congress came together. Are we going to be able to do it today to free America?
1130023714,Let me thank the gentleman from Colorado for his leadership. and I hope that we will continue this debate with my good friends on the other side of the aisle on this issue. It is just very challenging to have a structure of legislation that deems approval and does not do what I think all of us want it to do. which is to get moving to provide these jobs and to do what America is uniquely noted forthat we cross the Ts and dot the Is. that we make sure that the environmental concerns are answered. I rise on this rule to make several points. Mr. RUSH and I offered an amendment to strike section 4. In this bill. it does not allow for judicial review. It allows for people in Kentucky or in Arizona or in Texas to come to the District of Columbia to file their cases in the Court of Appeals. As a member of the Judiciary Committee. I raised concerns about that. My bill struck the provision that eliminated judicial review so that some burdened individual citizen couldnt just go into his Federal district court. I had another amendment that is very near and dear to me that wants to give new life to the jobs and businesses in the energy industry. which is to create a report to ensure that women. small businesses. minorityowned businesses get their fair shake and that we have an overall commitment to hiring the new young graduates who are coming out. many of them from the diverse community. which we see the energy industry is still seeking to outreach because there is a great need for increased diversity in many of these fields. Amendment No. 2 would have added a nonseverability clause so that. if anything were found to be unconstitutional. we would go back to the drawing board for this entire bill. Again. to have a major initiative be deemed approved. the Secretary of State authority deemed approved. the Presidential authority deemed approved. this is something that. my colleagues. we should work together on. I would finally suggest that I hope my colleagues will support my amendment on extending to 1 year the period for filing. Lets work together and make sure weve got something that will create jobs.
1130057838,"Madam Speaker. I rise to join my colleagues in celebrating ""the peoples Congressman."" I am so delighted that we have the opportunity to share our friendship toward the late Congressman Major Owens. who loved his Brooklyn district and loved his family. My deepest sympathy goes to his wife Maria. and all of his family members. Major Owens was truly someone who served the people. I am reminded of a story that he told of when his family heard that FDR was providing opportunities for work in the 1940s. No one in his community was getting jobs. but his parents wrote to FDR. and all of a sudden things changed. That is the kind of man Congressman Owens was. He was a changemaker. educator. and librarian. He was always there to say that his district and Americas poor people needed to be represented. He was. in fact. the peoples Congressperson because he extended his hand. He loved the people. He provided resources and he fought the good fight. I want to thank you. Congressman Major Owens. for being my friend and a friend of those in Congress. Republicans and Democrats. Most of all. I want to thank Congressman Major Owens for being the friend of poor people around the Nation who could not speak for themselves. I am glad that his giant footsteps had a great impact on the congressional district he represented. More importantly. he had a great impact on America. He was a soldier on the battlefield for those who could not speak for themselves. May he rest in peace. God bless him and his family. Madam Speaker. I rise to pay tribute to a great American. a fighter for justice and equality. one of the most passionate advocates for educational opportunity. and a man who served in this body with distinction. Major R. Owens of New York. Congressman Owens died Monday. October 21. in Manhattan at the age of 77. Major Owens was born June 28. 1936. in Collierville. Tennessee. He was educated at Morehouse College. from which he received his baccalaureate degree. and Atlanta University. from which he earned a Master of Science degree. Major Owens later moved to New York where he worked as a librarian before accepting an appointment from Mayor John V. Lindsay to serve as Director of the New York City Community Development Agency. He also served as a faculty member in the Department of Public Administration at Medgar Evers College. In 1974. Major Owens was elected to the New York State Senate and was reelected to serve a second term in 1978. In 1982. Major Owens won a competitive primary to fill the seat of retiring Congresswoman Shirley Chisolm. the first African American woman elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman ever to seek the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. As the Member of Congress for the 11th Congressional District of New York. Major Owens represented a diverse district and eclectic district centered in Brooklyn. and including low income areas of Brownsville and parts of BedfordStuyvesant. the large Hasidic community of Crown Heights. the heavily Caribbean areas of Flatbush and East Flatbush. and the more affluent neighborhoods Park Slope and Prospect Park. Affectionately known as the ""Education Congressman"" by his constituents. Major Owens fought tirelessly throughout his twelve terms in Congress to protect and expand educational opportunity for all Americans. especially those from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds. As he often reminded his colleagues in the House. education was ""the kingpin issue."" In an article he published in Black Issues in Higher Education. he wrote: ""We have to believe that all power and progress really begins with education."" Major Owens served on the House Committee on Government Reform and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. As the Ranking Member on the Education and Workforce Subcommittee for Workforce Protections. Congressman Owens helped lead the fight for minimum wage increases. blocked the attempt to eliminate cash payments for overtime. fought against efforts to roll back or repeal DavisBacon and to weaken the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As Chairman of the Education Subcommittee on Select Education and Civil Rights (198894). Congresswoman Owens was one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the Americans With Disabilities Act. which was enacted into law in 1991. In recognition for his yeoman work to pass the ADA. Major Owens was awarded an honorary degree by Galludet University. the worlds premier higher education institution serving deaf and hard of hearing people. Major Owens loved serving in this body and he was a valued member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus. As Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Task Force on Haiti. he led the successful threeyear fight which restored the democratically elected President JeanBertrand Aristide. Madam Speaker. Congressman Owens was a legislators legislator. Our prayers and condolences go out to his wife Maria. his sons Chris. Geoff. and Milard. his grandchildren. and to all his friends and loved ones. Major Owens touched so many lives in so many helpful ways that he will always be remembered by people he served so ably and selflessly for more than thirty years. Madam Speaker. a dear colleague has fallen. We are all saddened at the loss but overjoyed to have had the honor of serving with the distinguished gentleman from Brooklyn. New York. the honorable Major R. Owens."
1130068379,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to continue with our 50 floor speeches marking the 50th anniversary of the war on poverty. Now. yesterday. we were joined by President Lyndon Baines Johnson and Lady Bird Johnsons eldest daughter. Lynda Johnson Robb. to mark the 50th anniversary of her fathers State of the Union speech in which he declared an unconditional war on poverty. She reminded us that this was a bipartisan and bicameral effort led by the White House. Now. I have shared my own story. reluctantly. in the past of the time in my life when I depended on our vital social safety net programs during some very difficult times. but my testimony is only one of millions of other Americans. Many of you may be familiar with the Campaign to Cut Poverty in Half in Ten Years. a project of the Center for American Progress. the Coalition on Human Needs. and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Now. they are doing phenomenal work gathering American stories of those who are living in poverty and have been lifted out of poverty. including our own Congressman POCANS constituent. Amy Treptows story. Amy is here today. and I look forward to hearing Congressman POCAN read her story later on this House floor. Her story. though. is a true representation of the legacy of the war on poverty and the promise of the American Dream fulfilled. Her story is not unlike one of my constituents in Oakland who visited my office here in D.C. last month. After becoming a single mother. Jennifer was forced to stop attending her college courses and take a job making minimum wage as a caregiver. She relied on CalWIC and food stamps to feed her daughters. and her family and friends supported her with her housing and other basic needs. Today. two of her daughters are graduates of the Head Start program. which prepared them to start elementary school where they are currently doing very well. And Jennifer was able to finish school and is now working to advocate on behalf of other families like hers who had to turn to the American people in her time of need. Also. I am reminded that one of my former district directors was a graduate of the Head Start program. He is doing phenomenal work raising a family and living the American Dream. These are stories of resilience. They are the stories of millions of Americans who are facing homelessness. hunger and unemployment. if it werent for a safety net. In my home State of California. 6.3 million people17 percentlived in poverty in 2012. And in my district in Oakland. California. 18 percent of the residents live below the Federal poverty level. including one in four children. While the richest segments of our population continue to prosper nationally. income inequality traps millions of the working poor in poverty. Many lowwage workers must rely on food stamps and Medicaid just to survivewhich our colleague Congressman AL GREEN just brilliantly laid outjust to survive while CEOs are making megabillions with government subsidies. As a recent study by the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan showed. in any given month. 1.7 million households live on a cash income of less than $2 per day. Now that is comparable to many living in the developing world. Yes. $2. I said $2 per day. Now. that is here in America. the richest Nation on this Earth. In an economy that. despite recent gains. there are three unemployed for every one job opening. it is really a shame and a disgrace that 1.3 million people lost their lifeline as Republicans continue to refuse to extend emergency unemployment compensation. Now. these individuals checks should arrive or should have arrived this week. Unfortunately. they did not. What in the world are people going to do now? This is heartless. it is meanspirited. and. of course. to add insult to injury. many of these people lost about $35 in food stamp benefits last November. Yes. the economy has gotten better for some. but has left millions behind. Fifty years ago. the safety net was put in place just for times such as these. That is why it is so important to share stories like Jennifers and like Amys. Vital social safety net programs are still needed. We need to stop this war on the poor. We should have a ceasefire on the war on the poor. We have a moral and we have an economic obligation to make investments in economic opportunity and jobs.
1130069769,Let me thank the gentleman from Nevada and Mr. JEFFRIES again both for convening the Congressional Black Caucus. under your leadership and the leadership of our chairwoman. the honorable MARCIA FUDGE. and to be joining here on the floor. at least to date. with our colleague from New York. our colleague from North Carolina and our colleague from New Jersey. which is clearly showing the vast depth of this particular crisis going from South to North and to the far western State of Texas. Let me say to those who are presently unemployed. the 72.000 a week that occurs as we stand on the floor of the House. that you can count on the Members on this floor. the Democratic Members. the Congressional Black Caucus and our good friends on the other side of the aisle. to recognize that this is not a partisan issue but an American issue. Just a few weeks ago. or just last week. in fact. I had in the Houston Chronicle an oped that said the number one job of the House is to extend emergency unemployment aid. The program will help the economy by creating jobs and boosting growth. I think it is important to emphasize and refute some of the negative stigma that comes from those who misunderstand what the unemployment benefitor unemployment insurance. lets use that wordmeans. It means that individuals have actually worked. They are working people. They put into the idea of having an unemployment benefit. and the United States Federal Government determined in times of bad economic times to continue the 47 weeks through an emergency relief. By the way. it was supported by President George Bush in 2008 when he offered to say that these individuals have worked previously. they are looking for work. and they deserve to be able to support their families. Individuals like Anetta Parker. who has been looking for work for 2 years. who is holding up the very letter that she held up at my press conference in Houston to acknowledge that this is a letter that many people are getting in their mailboxes. Not only are they getting these letters. but they are not getting any indication for relief. call United Way. call social services. I can tell you. people who work do not have a tendency to know the local social services. and they are desperate. They get a letter that they are being cut off. In the midst of this I met individuals who are looking for work and said. I am now homeless because those dollars were allowing me to pay week to week for a place to live. a place to clean myself. if you will. to make myself presentable for work. to look for work. which is a requirement of the emergency unemployment insurance benefit. and they are now on the streets. Not only are they on the streets. Mr. HORSFORD. but when I went home on Friday and sat down again at the career and recovery resources to look for or to talk with more individuals. many of these persons are veterans. because veterans are taught to suck it up. and they have not even. in some instances. attempted to get these benefitsto those who would say that everybody just wants to be on the dole. So beyond the unemployment benefits of 1.3 million. there are many others that we have not approached. So it is important that this Special Order is done to reach to the other side of the aisle for the Speaker to put on the floor of the House an emergency 3month extension of unemployment benefits. to not cast aside individuals who have been looking for work and to not ignore the fact that over this cold December. we lost 16.000 jobs in construction. we lost some 11.000 jobs in the movie industry. we lost jobs in the sports industry. and we are continuing to lose jobs because this month was a cold month. So the production of jobs was 78.000. Even though this economy is rebounding and we have had some other good months. this month. the December month. it was 78.000. Dont you think that those individuals who are looking for work were rebuffed by the fact. or were blocked by the fact. that there were jobs that were lost? So I would like to encourage my friends in the other body to quickly find a way of coming together. As my colleagues know. they postponed the votes today. I believe that some of the suggestions being made about pension relief for military persons may be a basis of finding compromise. but I think when we pit the idea of fiscal responsibilities and deficits against individuals having a roof over their head and children having food on the table. it is disgraceful. It is equally disgraceful when people misinterpret the idea of what unemployment benefits are all about. As I wrote this oped. it saddened me. though I believe in the First Amendment. when letters came in response to the oped. and they wanted to ask a question: Why dont these people get a job? Why dont we have a jobs program? That didnt disappoint me. I think that is a good question. But they didnt seem to understand that it was people looking for work who could not find work. It was long lines of people who couldnt find work. They want to work. So I would say to them. this is not a hand out but a helping hand. I expect to introduce soon a training bill that allows individuals who are on unemployment benefits to get a stipend to be able to utilize for Labor Departmentdesignated disciplines of work. to train for work that needs additional workers. So it is not a stipend to go out to your local jobtraining setup that somebody set up. It is actually to have officially documented needs for the particular profession that you are training for. You get your unemployment benefit. you are not cut off. and you get a stipend for that training. That creates jobs. But just to say lets pass various bills. like the Keystone bill. and that is the cause of no jobs is not accurate. But I do think we can support the jobs bill of the President. and we will create jobs. So I want to thank the gentleman for allowing us to come and to be able to highlight that in the cold of the winter there are people on line trying to get work. and that were people on line trying to get work in November and October and September and August and July. because this young lady. Ms. Parker. has been looking for work for 2 years. She is a very competent administrative assistant. along with many others. Veterans have been looking for work. So I would like to say to those I met with on Friday. we will not forget you. We recognize that you are deserving of human dignity and that you want to work. that you have worked. that you are not looking for a handout. and that the unemployment insurance is not a handout. It is an emergency relief for those who have worked. Let us have compassion. Let us have sympathy. Let us care about others. and let us work together to extend the unemployment insurance benefit to provide for the families of America. I thank the gentleman. [From the Houston Chronicle. Jan. 8. 2014]
1130081512,Mr. Speaker. this morning I want to take a few moments to share thoughts with my colleagues on a number of items that I believe we should be focused on. Before I do that. I want to join my friends and colleagues from the great State of Washington to express my concern and my sympathy for the people of Darrington and Oso on Highway 530 that have experienced this terrible devastation of a mudslide. To the families of those who lost their loved ones. we mourn and pray for you. and to those who are still missing. we thank the first responders and pray for their accuracy in discerning and finding those that are alive. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee. and as we have a hearing this morning on emergency preparedness. I am asking that all of the resources that the delegation from Washington request. and. as well. the Governor of that State. that all of us will embrace them. stand as Americans. unite behind them and provide the resources as we do for our fellow brothers and sisters in this country because it is the American way that we never leave a lonely person along the highway of despair. We always provide for them. And I want those people in Darrington and the city of Oso to know that we will not leave you along the highway of despair. I want to now challenge this Congress. the other body. as they proceed to move on what actions should be taken in Ukraine. We know that Americans are warweary. but if we have principles of democracy. if we believe there is an international world order. we cannot sit idly by and not act. So I am grateful that the President has strongly denounced Russias actions and has begun to move on strong sanctions. I would argue that there should be more. We should ensure that the new Ukrainian Government that wants to cling to aspects of democracy and wants to associate with a democratic Europe. that they be allowed to strengthen themselves. We cannot have a timidness on behalf of Europe. so busy worrying about their pocketbook that they will stamp on their principles. Some European countries are now wavering about sanctions. I would suggest to them that they are dangerously providing an opportunity for Russia to continue its aggressive and illegal acts. You must have principles. You must provide the strength to sanction. One can travel through the years of history in the 20th century and be reminded of those who get one step of aggression and watch as they march across Europe. I am very glad that there will be no meeting of G8 in Sochi. and I would ask that we continue to isolate Russia. Russia violates the human rights of its own people. It does not even recognize the LGBT community. and they are persecuted. What more do we have to hear from Russia and its head of government to not know that they must suffer the consequences of their acts. I stand with the people of Ukraine because I believe in democracy. I believe in peace and human dignity. and I believe America has those values that we can ensure through the world family that Russia understands that they are not part of the world order of democracy and the freedom of people. I might also add. Mr. Speaker. as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee. all of us have watched. some with intenseness the Malaysian aircraft. With great disappointment and sadness. we are told. without all of the facts. not knowing what the recent announcements have been. that this aircraft. this airliner may be lost. But it opens our eyes to the crisis of airline security and technology. I call upon the aviation industry to stop hiding behind costs and how much it costs and start ensuring that our pilots and our customers. our flying public are safe. Why do we have the capacity to dismantle the transponders? Why wasnt the emergency call already in place that automatically signals when an aircraft goes off its designated destination as relates to its flight pattern? Why does it have to be done manually? The mysterious turn. Homeland Security will be having a hearing on the false passport. Finally. Mr. Speaker. it is overdue for us to pass comprehensive immigration reform. and I will continue that discussion.
1130082684,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 4278. the ""Ukraine Support Act."" I support this legislation because I stand in solidarity with the freedom loving people of Ukraine. who are under siege from Russian encroachment. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4278 authorizes $70 million in aid to Ukraine. including $50 million for democracy and civil society efforts. The bill also codifies and expands sanctions imposed this month by the Obama Administration against certain Russian officials and calls on President Obama to sanction Russian officials. corporations and those engaged in the Russian arms sector who have undermined the Ukrainian government or committed human rights abuses. The President is also authorized to examine whether Russia has violated a 1988 arms treaty and permits him to freeze assets and deny visas. Specifically. the bill authorizes $50 million for the President to provide assistance to support democracy and strengthen civil society in Ukraine. This assistance is to be used to improve transparency. rule of law. and anticorruption efforts. strengthen political organizations. and protect independent media as Ukraine prepares for free and fair elections in May. Additionally. up to $10 million is authorized for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America to increase broadcasts into eastern Ukraine (including Crimea). Moldova and other nearby ethnic Russian communities. The broadcasts should. in particular. counter misinformation from Russiasupported news outlets. In addition to this direct aid. the bill also supports the people of Ukraine in the following ways: 1. Encourages the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to prioritize investments in Ukraine. 2. Authorizes $8 million to help Ukraine develop an independent judiciary and eliminate human rights abuses by law enforcement authorities. 3. Encourages increased U.S. security cooperation among NATO states in Central and Eastern Europe through military training. exercises and the exchange of defense articles. and directs the Secretary of State to report to Congress within 30 days of enactment with a review of U.S. security assistance to that country. 4. Expresses the sense of Congress that the administration should provide expedited assistance to the Ukrainian government to identify and recover assets stolen from the government or linked to corruption by former officials. including former President Viktor Yanukovych. and 5. Offsets the cost of assistance to Ukraine by reducing the $1.5 billion authorized for Pakistan in the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 by $70 million. That is why I strongly support the codification of three Presidential executive orders issued in March sanctioning individuals involved in the violence in Ukraine or who undermine the independence. sovereignty. or territorial or economic integrity of Ukraine. Such sanctions could include the seizure of financial assets. the denial of visas. and other penalties. The sanctions could be ended if the President certifies to Congress that Ukrainian sovereignty. independence or territorial integrity is not being violated by Russia or any other state actor. or after Jan. 1. 2020. if the President certifies that their termination is in the national security interest of the United States. Finally. the bill requires the President. within 30 days of enactment and within 180 days thereafter for at least two years. to report to Congress on senior Russian political figures who are engaged in such activity. It also requires the President. along identical timelines. to report to Congress on foreign financial institutions (especially Russian banks) to determine whether they are involved in the confiscation of Ukrainian assets. money laundering. terrorist or proliferation financing. or actively helping to skirt sanctions. or helping to annex Crimea. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the President should expand the list of Russian officialscurrently at 18sanctioned for gross human rights violations under the Magnitsky Act of 2012. Mr. Speaker. it is right that the civilized world. led by the United States. opposes aggression and the violation of territorial sovereignty by the Putin regime. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4278."
1130101906,"Mr. Chair. I thank the chairman very much. I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the committee and knowing how hard they have worked. I hope that this discussion today will emphasize a commitment to transparency and a commitment to consumers and a commitment to making the legislation responsive to consumers. So I thank you for the opportunity. This legislation is to reauthorize and improve the operations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as well as address concerns from customers from another failure such as the MF Global and Peregrine Financial. It is a product of a multiyear process that included hearings and perspectives from market participants. end users. futures customers. and the CFTC. The Jackson Lee amendment only seeks to improve this bill. If passed. it would require a study that will provide very basic information about firms regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The amendment simply requires the CFTC to do a report examining the number of entities regulated by them. the entitys size. practice models. and assets under management. We must be quick to acknowledge that the dramatic failures of not just MF Global but several other venerated firms. such Bear Stearns. speak loudly to requiring more information for the consumer. This amendment would also provide more insight as to how the industry works. My amendment gives 2 years for the agency to complete the first study. That is a very long time. Again. the report provides more information for the very consumers that we are trying to protect. That is more than enough time for the staff of the CFTC to comply with the amendment. In that span of 2 years. a lot of things can change. but the gist of the amendment is to provide more transparency for the investors. as many on this floor have already spoken of. It is critical that investors know what is going on. particularly small investors who are not privy to the information that many of the larger entities are made aware. My amendment. again. basic information via an agency study. much of which the Commission already has. and I am merely seeking to have it. Let me just share just one aspect of this and then conclude. More importantly. in my conclusion. many of the residents of the 18th Congressional District have invested in homes. stocks. and education. to see it all flittered away because someone on Wall StreetFrance or Houston. evenpushed the wrong button generating a contratrade when they meant to bid in the other direction. This is not what Americans want to see. This is a regulated entity. Transparency is viable. Let me show you a letter that was sent from the trustee of MF Global to some poor person who. after 5 years. got their few dollars after this major bankruptcy. Enclosed with this mailing is a check from the trustee in payment of your allowed customer claim. They got it 5 years later. With this check the full net equity value. as established in the Bankruptcy Court. of your segregated property. the amount related to your trading on domestic exchanges or ""4(d) Property."" will have been distributed to you. Your former account number at MF Global appears on the check. Please cash this check as soon as possible. That is another frightening thing. You better hurry up and get the $25 or $40 that came. To ensure proper and prompt processing. I will include the letter for the RECORD here."
1130109414,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 5111. ""An Act to Improve the Response To victims Of Child Sex Trafficking."" I would like to congratulate Representative BEATTY for her work. Youth sexual exploitation and trafficking is a major issue in this country that affects more than 293.000 young Americans. As a Representative of Texas. this issue is close to my heart as my state is plagued by this problem. For example. multiple sporting events. conventions. and other large festivities make Houston a prime location for trafficking. Another metric demonstrating the high level of trafficking in Houston is the high volume of calls to National Trafficking Hotline coming from Houston. I have worked on this issue for a very long time as a member of the AntiHuman Trafficking Caucus and recognize the enormous damage that human trafficking does to its victim and to society. There have been many efforts made to improve how our system addresses the issue of sex trafficking. However. there is still a great deal of work to be done to reframe the issue as one of abuse and exploitation of children rather than one of teenage prostitution. The legal definition of sex trafficking states that ""any individual induced or caused to engage in commercial sex activity who is under 18 is a victim of trafficking."" But what about those who are teenagers and voluntarily engage in this sort of activity? We need to update the Missing Childrens Assistance Act so that it better recognizes these young people as victims of a serious crime and reports the information accordingly. Under current law. (42 U.S.C. 5773 (b)(1)(P)). the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children operates a cyber tipline to provide online users and electronic service providers a means of reporting Internetrelated child sexual exploitation in many areas. including child prostitution. Children. who are sex trafficked or sexually exploited. even if they are in their teens. are victims. They are not criminals and should not be categorized as such. H.R. 5111 would replace the term ""child prostitution"" with ""child sex trafficking"" in order to reinforce that children who are sex trafficked or sexually exploited are victims whose situation should be taken seriously when reported on the online tipline. I believe that this bill is a step in the right direction for recognizing the broad impact of sex trafficking in the United States and assisting those who are exploited by it. I urge all members to join me in supporting H.R. 5111 so we can all work towards a society where we no longer have to worry about our children being exploited by the sex trade."

1130028182,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1256. the Swap Jurisdiction Certainty Act. which requires the CFTC and the SEC to cooperate on a single rule for how U.S. derivatives regulations are applied overseas. This bill and several others we will consider today are critically important to the work we have begun in the House Agriculture Committee to reform DoddFrank and make this bill less onerous for our farmers and bankers. As Commissioner Jill Sommers noted. it appears as though the CFTC was ""guided by what could only be called the Intergalactic Commerce Clause as they prepared their crossborder guidance when it was released last summer. How foreign institutions comply with DoddFrank is of enormous consequence. The CFTC has taken the position that virtually everyone everywhere is a U.S. person and subject to its jurisdiction. Without question. this expansive claim of jurisdiction is going to raise the cost for farmers and end users in my home State of North Carolina to hedge their risk and diminish global competitiveness of our domestic financial firms. which employ many people back home in North Carolina. The CFTC is risking all this to an end that no one seems to fully understand. Their actions are making financial regulatory reform more burdensome and more complicated. while serving only to alienate the CFTC and U.S. markets from the rest of the world. The Swap Jurisdiction Certainty Act would force the CFTC to cooperate with the SEC on a single standard for crossborder application of swaps regulations. In addition. the bill is narrowly tailored to guarantee that the top nine foreign swaps markets will be recognized by the CFTC and SEC as having comparable rules so foreign firms would be governed by the laws of their home countries. This bill does not allow unchecked swaps markets to spring up in Caribbean island nations or the four corners of Southeast Asia. as some on the other side of the aisle have alluded. Instead. it directs the CFTC to do what it should have done in the first place: to cooperate with its fellow regulators both down the street and around the world. I urge its adoption."
1130037906,I thank my colleague. Mr. Speaker. Its an honor to be here tonight. Im a new Member of Congress. I was elected just last year. I ran for Congress the first time I had ever run for office because I want to come up here and fight for people. because there are folks back home that are frustrated. they feel like their government is not being responsive to their needs. So Im here to represent them and be a voice for those people. I think of the homebuilder in Monroe. North Carolina. who told me hes just struggling to keep his head above water and hell take any kind of work just to keep his crew intact so he can keep them together. Hell do remodeling work or anything. Hes not even worried about profit so much as being able to keep afloat. I think about the families across the Eighth District of North Carolina who are looking to us for solutions. Thats why Im here tonight to join this conversation. to talk about immigration reform. The key to immigration reform. as far as Im concerned is. weve got to look at compassion and weve got to look at fairness. When it comes to fairness. we are a Nation of immigrants. but were also a Nation of laws. So weve got to make sure were enforcing the law in this country and were respecting the rule of law when were looking at making changes to immigration policy. We also need to look with compassion on those who have come here to the United States seeking that American Dream when we try to determine what were going to do going down the road. But I think the key to this is the approach were taking here in the House of Representatives. The Senate has passed an immigration bill. Its a bill that was cobbled together behind closed doors. It was a bill that in my opinion went too far too fast. Were taking a much more thoughtful approach here in the House. Were going to go through the committee process. Were going to bring legislation to the floor so that we can debate these key issues affecting immigration as single issues and let the American people take part in this conversation and tell us what they think about issues like border security. Now. the key to immigration reform in my opinion is weve got to secure the borders first. and any legislation that we pass out of this Chamber. any agreement we make with the Senate on immigration. weve got to have a trigger so that no other pieces of this immigration puzzle fall into place until weve got that border secure. So were going to work hard to make sure thats part of our solution. There are actually five pieces of legislation that have already passed out of the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees. I serve on the Homeland Security Committee. We passed the Border Security Results Act of 2013. What this does is it requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a comprehensive strategy to secure the border. What a radical concept: lets actually have a plan. And so what were saying in the House is: give us a plan. We want the Department of Homeland Security to work with the border sheriffs to come up with a plan to secure that border and come back to Congress and say. heres what we need. Heres the sections where we need fences. Heres the other types of technology. whether it be drones or other types of technological monitoring. These are the pieces of the puzzle we need to secure the border. And a key to this is we have to have a metrics so we can measure whether the border is secure or not. Currently. we know the numerator. but we dont know the denominator. We know how many folks were stopping coming across the border. but we dont know how many we arent rounding up. And if you talk to any of the border sheriffs. youll know that were not anywhere close to being secure. So thats a key component of this legislation. I look forward to talking more about some of the legislation that came out of the Judiciary Committee. some of the pieces of this immigration reform puzzle that we need to discuss.
1130058734,"Mr. Speaker. given the bicameral and bipartisan support for our bill and the overwhelming consensus about the systemic risk created by the section we are working to reform today. I am genuinely surprised we are even here debating this today. Nevertheless. I rise to speak in support of H.R. 992. the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act. which my Democrat friend from New York. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY. and I have worked together on in the House Agriculture Committee. As my colleagues are aware. our bipartisan bill amends a provision in the DoddFrank Act which was included at the llth hour to ""get 60 votes in the Senate"" as former House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank indicated during a markup of the bill back in February. 2012. This section we reform with our bill was mischaracterized as an effort to prevent ""risky"" swaps activities in the bank. While we believe this provision was proposed in good faith. it simply does not prevent the risk that its authors intended. Moreover. this provision of the bill will cause many American financial institutions to operate at a significant disadvantage to their foreign competitors. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker have both publicly raised concerns about section 716. In the 112th Congress. the House Financial Services Democrats. including Chairman Frank and current Ranking Member MAXINE WATERS. endorsed H.R. 1838. agreeing that this measure addressed the valid criticisms of section 716 without ""weakening the financial reforms laws important derivative safeguards or prohibitions on bank proprietary trading."" The bill before us today is virtually identical to H.R. 1838 from the last Congress. Mr. Speaker. to echo what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said at a hearing on February 27: Section 716. as drafted. will not reduce risk and will likely increase costs of people who use the derivatives and make it more difficult for the bank to compete with foreign competitors who can provide a more complete set of services. It is crystal clear: this section needs to be reformed. I ask my colleagues to support this bill and look forward to my Senate colleague. KAY HAGAN. passing her companion bill in the Senate so we can get this commonsense reform completed."
1130068629,"I thank the gentlelady. Mr. Speaker. I will tell you that my colleague from Missouri has been a true leader in Congress. It is a real honor to serve with you. and I thank you for your leadership. particularly on this important issue. ObamaCare is an absolute disaster. We have seen disastrous impacts back home in North Carolina with the loss of jobs. I talk to folks every day when I go home. I go home every weekend. I travel the district. I talk to businesses. and folks tell me that they have never sat on more capital. The reason they are doing that is that they dont know what the costs of health care are going to be. So we have got businesses out there that could be expanding. that could be hiring people. but because of this health care lawbecause of the uncertainty created by it. because of the rising costswe have got businesspeople who are not hiring. That is why we are not seeing job growth like we ought to see. That is why this is the flattest. longest recession we have seen in our countrys history. This awful health care law is also destroying the greatest health care system in the world. We are seeing premiums increase. I get letters and emails every day from my constituents who tell me their premiums have gone up. I talked to a woman the other day who is working three jobs. Her husband is working parttime because he cant find fulltime work. but she is working three jobs just so she can pay for health care. That was before the premium increase. Mr. Speaker. we have seen so many folks who have had their plans canceled. It has been said that the lie of the century is that. if you like your health care. you can keep it. People are seeing their health care plans canceled. and it is going to get worse because. when businesses have to start looking at whether they can afford to keep folks on their health care or notwhether the math adds up for them. whether they can afford to do that given all the new. excessive mandateswe are going to see more people lose their insurance. It is an absolute disaster. I am committed to doing everything I can to repeal this law and replace it because. at the end of the day. this is about people. and in this countrythe greatest country in the history of the worldwe can do better than this. We can offer health care that is the worlds best quality health care at a price that people can afford. and we can put people in charge of their health care decisions. not bureaucrats in Washington like this awful law does. so I am committed to repealing this law. In the meantime. I urge my colleagues to support the bill that is coming to the floor tomorrow. a bill that deals with one of the disastrous aspects of this law that I havent mentioned yet. and that is the risk to millions of Americans that their personal information can be divulgedcan be stolenbecause of the lack of security on the ObamaCare Web site. This is a horrendous problem. Million of Americans are at risk. and there is no accountability. So what we are asking for is to put that accountability in place. that if peoples personal information is lost. those folks have to be notified. The Federal Government thinks that businesses should live by that standard. The Federal Government says that States that have set up their exchanges should live by that standard. I say that the Federal Government ought to live by the same standard. If that personal information is compromised. then the individual should be notified. and the government should take responsibility and rectify the situation. This is simple. commonsense legislation that I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I hope our colleagues in the other body. and I hope our President will support. We owe it to the American people to do the right thingto make sure their information is secure. If something happens. God forbid. we must do the right thing and notify those individuals. We rectify the situation. We take responsibility for it. So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is the right thing to do by the American people. I urge them to vote ""yes"" tomorrow."
1130091376,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the life of Army Command Sergeant Major Edward James ONeal and to commemorate his service to our great Nation. ONeal was a great friend of mine and a champion of his fellow veterans in Richmond County and all of North Carolina. He began his distinguished military career at a young age. enlisting in the Army in 1956 at the age of 17. After basic training. ONeal quickly rose up the ranks. training and serving from Fort Bragg. North Carolina. to Laos. Cambodia. and Vietnam. After 20 years of dedicated service. including four tours in Vietnam and being awarded three Purple Hearts. ONeal retired in November of 1976.

1130105626,Mr. Chairman. I rise this evening to offer an amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill that would prohibit the funding for any program included that is not authorized by law. For far too long. Congress has continued to appropriate spending on government programs with little to no oversight. Our country has essentially been on autopilot towards a cliff of fiscal and economic disaster. This has resulted in a massive and outofcontrol bureaucracy that is wasteful and inefficient. In this bill alone there are 23 unauthorized programs. Some of these programs were last authorized in 1981. and there are others that have never been authorized. In total. these unauthorized and unchecked programs in this legislation receive around $25 billion. With over $17 trillion in debt. we owe it to our constituents to review each agency and program to determine if they are the best use of taxpayer dollars to serve the public need. Additionally. the rules of the House require that appropriations may only be made for purposes authorized by law. The prohibition on unauthorized appropriations cannot be enforced because the rules that bring appropriation bills to the floor routinely prevent a point of order from being raised. My amendment prohibits spending on unauthorized programs. but it exempts defenserelated programs because these were authorized by the House when we passed the defense authorization bill in May. This amendment parallels with my bill. H.R. 3847. the Federal Sunset Act of 2014. which would force Congress to evaluate each agency and program and consider recommendations to reform or abolish specific entities to ensure the best use of our resources. Mr. Chairman. this type of sweeping reform would dramatically overhaul the way that Washington budgets and spends hardearned tax dollars and allow Congress to finally take back control. scale back our bloated bureaucracy. and provide accountability to the Federal Government. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130108633,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 4802. the Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2014. As chairman of the Committee on Homeland Securitys Subcommittee on Transportation Security. I introduced this bipartisan bill to improve the state of preparedness at our Nations airports in response to the shooting that occurred at Los Angeles International Airport in November of last year. The shooting that occurred at LAX. which took the life of Transportation Security Officer Gerardo Hernandez and wounded three other people. served as a tragic wakeup call to the relative ease with which someone can wreak havoc in one of our Nations busiest airports. In March of this year. the Subcommittee on Transportation Security conducted a site visit and field hearing at LAX to examine the response to the incident and better understand the actions that have been taken to improve incident response in the wake of this tragedy. Subsequently. my subcommittee held a followup hearing to receive testimony from additional representatives of the law enforcement and airport communities on security incident response. Over the course of these activities. through this process. the subcommittee found that while the Federal. State. and local response to the LAX shooting was heroic and swiftly executed. there is room for improvement in how airport operators. TSA. and other stakeholders coordinate the response and communicate in the crucial moments after a major security incident like this. Based on months of careful review and stakeholder input by the subcommittee. as well as detailed afteraction reports by the Los Angeles World Airports and TSA. H.R. 4802 would require the Transportation Security Administration to provide assistance to all airports where TSA performs or oversees screening to verify that each airport has detailed. practiced plans for responding to security incidents. This includes plans for evacuating travelers. establishing unified command. testing radio equipment. and conducting joint exercises among responding agencies. This legislation would also make TSA a clearinghouse for security incident response and communications best practices. which was a key recommendation from testimony the subcommittee received in May. In addition. the bill would require TSA to certify to Congress that all screening personnel have participated in an active shooter training. which is a requirement TSA appropriately instituted on its own following the LAX shooting. The bill will also require TSA to assess whether interoperable communications capabilities exist among responding agencies at airports where TSA performs or oversees screening. We know interoperability is an ongoing challenge among many first responders. despite billions being spent to achieve better communications since 91 11. but. at this point. no one has done an overall assessment to determine what weaknesses exist in terms of communications at our Nations airports. Finally. the bill requires TSA to examine how it can increase its reimbursement of law enforcement officers who protect the screening checkpoints. These men and women are the front line of defense in protecting the traveling public. While TSAs funding for law enforcement reimbursement has decreased in recent years. the critical role these officers play at our airport checkpoints has never been more important. This bill is a necessary step towards countering the threats facing our Nations airports. without placing an undue burden on airport operators. law enforcement. or the taxpayers. In fact. according to TSA. the cost of providing assistance to airports will be incidental and would not require additional appropriations. This bill. nonetheless. makes it clear to TSA that no new funding is being authorized to carry out any of the provisions of this bill and that existing appropriations should be used to carry out this act. I want to thank the chairman of the full committee. Mr. MIKE MCCAUL. for his support of this bill and for moving it through the full committee. as well as the ranking member of the full committee. Mr. THOMPSON. and the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. RICHMOND. for cosponsoring this legislation and for working with us to produce this important legislation. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1130108813,I thank the gentleman. my neighbor from South Carolina. Mr. DUNCAN. I appreciate your leadership on this issue. I couldnt agree with you more. Many of our constituents back home in North Carolina and South Carolina are entering the second half of the summer. They are preparing to take trips to the beach. maybe trips to the mountains. maybe going to visit relatives. Many of our constituents are contemplating those trips and. frankly. are experiencing a little sticker shock as they factor in the cost of gasoline and what it is going to cost their family. Many of our constituents are struggling. They either are not in the job they want to be in or they are looking for a job. and it is tough to make ends meet. If you add the high cost of energy to that. it is a real burden on people. It affects real people back home. Frankly. it doesnt have to be that way because we have got tremendous opportunities to have American sources of energy. It is just a shame we are not going after them. I agree also with my colleague there are not a lot of things that President Obama and I agree on. but I do applaud his decision to allow us to do seismic mapping off the shore of the Atlantic Coast. We have tremendous opportunities in North Carolina. as well as Virginia and South Carolina. to find these large reserves. We know there is natural gas there. We know there is petroleum there. We need to find out what is exactly there. So this is an important first step to get this seismic permitting so that we can know what kind of energy resources we have exactly. But I want to get North Carolina in the energy business. We have got the opportunity to put people to work. As my colleague mentioned. North Dakota pays a $2.000 signing bonus at McDonalds because they cant find enough people because everybody has a job. and I look at North Carolina and my neighbors who are struggling to find work. Lets put people in energy jobs. Not only will it bring down the cost of energy for us at the pump. but it will put people to work. There is another phenomena happening out there. We have lost a tremendous amount of manufacturing jobs in North Carolina. particularly in my part of the State. but we are seeing some of those jobs start to come back. The reason they are starting to come back is because of energy costs. Even despite the fact that the current President wont allow any new permitting on publics lands. through fracking and other technology. we find it on private lands. We are being able to bring down some of our energy costs through exploration. Imagine what we would do if we could unleash American energy by allowing us to go after all of our resources. whether they are on public lands or offshore. We can have a manufacturing renaissance in this country by having affordable American energy. We can start creating jobs like you wouldnt believe. There is no reason why we are not doing that. So I am happy to be here tonight with my colleagues to talk about the importance of this. I am just ready to unleash the American energy and ready to bring those jobs back.
1130119051,"Mr. Speaker. you may notice my sharp jacket tonight. It is a madras jacket worn in honor of my dear friend and colleague. HOWARD COBLE. HOWARD was not always known for just his colorful jackets. Back when he first came to town. HOWARD C0BLE was known for his many colorful suspenders. In fact. I dont know how many he had. but it was wellknown that he would always have those bright. colorful suspenders on. Next he became known for wearing distinctive hats. In fact. in the nineties. Tim Russert used to refer to HOWARD C0BLE as ""the man with the hat."" Then it was Tim Russerts son. Luke. who first noticed the madras jackets a few years ago. and he actually put on his Twitter account that the jacket HOWARD C0BLE is wearing tonight looked like ""an exploding turtle."" So the Russert family has long acknowledged HOWARDS unique sense of style. as have many of his constituents and his friends here in Congress. HOWARD C0BLE has been known for his sense of humor. He once remarked that if he put on a brandnew suit. it would immediately look rumpled like an unmade bed. HOWARD has always had a selfdeprecating humor and a personality that draws people to him. Everyone loves him. I learned that as a candidate for Congress. Mr. Speaker. because I inherited three counties from HOWARD COBLEs former district. so when I would go ask people for votes. I had to immediately tell them I wasnt running against HOWARD COBLE because. otherwise. they didnt want to talk to me. HOWARD COBLE is legendary in his constituent services. He has always taken care of his constituents. They know they have a friend in their Congressman HOWARD COBLE. He set a standard. Mr. Speaker. to which we can all aspire to in terms of the integrity with which he has conducted himself. the love for people that everyone knows and can sense and is drawn to. and the constituent service. Mr. Speaker. it has been a privilege to get to know HOWARD COBLE. It has been an honor to serve with him. and I call him friend. I will miss seeing him in Congress every day. but I know that he will not be a stranger. I just say. God bless you. HOWARD COBLE. and Godspeed."

1140041684,I want to thank my good friend. the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois. ROBIN KELLY. for once again presiding over this important CBC Special Order hour. as well as her coanchor. the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey. who is right across the Hudson River. and who so ably serves the communities of Newark and beyond. Mr. Speaker. this evening we have heard from so many distinguished members of the Congressional Black Caucus. most recently from the gentlewoman from Texas. with whom I serve on the Judiciary Committee. about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the Confederate battle flag. but perhaps more importantly: What is the legacy that we want to have as Americans. as Members of Congress. in dealing with the complicated issue of race? It is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the House floor to have this conversation. This is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the American people. an appropriate one. I would add. given the Houses constitutional relationship to the people of America. this. of course. being the only institution that was envisioned by the Founding Fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people. The Senates Members. of course. in its original constitutional version. were elected by the State legislature. Then. of course. the Presidency. to this day. is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the Electoral College. So this is the peoples House. the institution most intimately connected to the people of America and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power. We witnessed that last week as we were forced. unfortunately. to discuss the issue of the Confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all racesDemocrats and Republicans. Blacks. Whites. the extraordinary leadership from the Governor of South Carolina. and the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina. JIM CLYBURNcame together. At the moment when the Confederate battle flag was coming down in South Carolina. there were Members of this House trying to lift it up. It was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in America. led in South Carolina. to address the battle flag issue on this House floor. but I am hopeful that. as we move forward now in a more productive way. we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in America that supporters of the Confederate battle flag have fought against. As others have detailed during the presentation here today. the battle flag. which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the Civil War. remained largely dormant in American history until 1954 in the Supreme Courts decision of Brown vs. Board of Education. It was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that African Americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the Deep South and in other places in America. Really. it was in the midfifties and then into the early sixties when the Confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold Jim Crow. It was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like Congressman JOHN LEWIS. who in 1965 was the cochair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. It was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by JOHN LEWIS and others to make sure that the franchisethe right to votewas colorblind in nature and that the 15th Amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout America and in the Deep South. where there were those who were trying to prevent African Americans from being able to vote. The battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening. It seems to me that. rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down. no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor. So it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the House floor last week and have to come to the House floor today to continue to address this issue. Hopefully. reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of dayseven prior to the August recessand we can move beyond the Confederate battle flag issue and address some important. substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the Confederacy. We dont want to see the ghosts of the Confederacy invading the United States Congress from a policy perspective. Those nine soulsGodfearing. churchgoing African Americanswho were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired. in part. by the Confederate battle flag. One of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down. but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across America. As has been mentioned. we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the United States. How can it be that we have 5 percent of the worlds population. but 50 percent of the worlds guns? It is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation. Nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the Federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in America. It is an incredible act of legislative malpractice. but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in America. Isnt it reasonable. particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in Charleston. South Carolina. that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns. consistent with the Second Amendment. from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm? It seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as Americans. It also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to stop trying to prevent Americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in American democracy. Yet. something happened in the aftermath of 2008. a real interesting moment in November of that year. that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country. As a result. 2 years later. when there was a midterm election. subsequent to that. there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud. fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud. Not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed. but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the Confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the Confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties. What shocks me is that even the Supreme Court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated. and this House refuses to act on fixing the Voting Rights Act. I would argue thatagain. consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming togetherthat. perhaps. that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down. on the one hand. the divisive symbol of hatredthe Confederate battle flagfrom here in this Capitol and in whatever form it hangs all across America so that we can lift up policies that make Americans safer. policies that are consistent with our values and that everyoneWhite. Black. Latino. Asian. Democrats. and Republicansshould be able to rally around. I am thankful for Congresswoman KELLYS and Congressman PAYNES leadershipthis wonderful tandem. R. KELLY and D. PAYNE. who are tremendous advocates here in the Congressand for their giving me this opportunity to share these thoughts.
1140044860,Mr. Speaker. this is the final amendment to the bill. which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco was a national tragedy that certainly shocked the conscience of America. We must continue to mourn her passing. We must continue to stand behind her family. We must continue to make sure that her killer is prosecuted to the full extent of the law. but we should not respond with irresponsible public policy. Our Founders indicated that the House of Representatives is supposed to reflect the passions of the people. but the passions should be properly channeled into an appropriate legislative vehicle. On December 14. 2012. 20 children were brutally gunned down in Sandy Hook Elementary School. More than 30.000 additional Americans have died as a result of gun violence since that fateful day. Mr. Speaker. 952 days have passed. This House has done nothing. On June 27. 2013. the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill. 52 Democrats. 14 Republicans. 2 Independents. That bill would have secured our borders. That bill would have reduced the deficit by more than $850 billion over 20 years. That bill would have required undocumented immigrants to learn English. pay back taxes. pass a criminal background check. and then get at the back of the line. Mr. Speaker. 757 days have passed. This House has done nothing. Instead. we are here today considering a misguided legislative response to a terrible tragedy. That is why I offer this amendment. which will prevent the elimination or reduction of funds to State or local law enforcement organizations if the Attorney General determines that the elimination of funding would result in an overall increase in the crime rate. particularly with respect to domestic violence. sex trafficking. and crimes against children. or if it would result in a decrease in the number of trained law enforcement officers on American streets.
1140054953,I thank the distinguished gentleman. first. from California for his leadership and for all that you have done to make sure that issues of importance to the next generation of Americans. such as the one that we are discussing here today. get prominence on the House floor. this great vehicle for communicating to the American people. and. of course. to be here with the still young pioneers of this wonderful effort. Congresswoman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and Congressman RYAN. It is just a great honor. Clearly. we have a student loan debt crisis that commands the attention of the American people and should command the attention of people here in the House of Representatives and on the other side of the Capitol. but does not always do so. which is why communicating the urgency of the situation is so significant. just the notion. I have got constituents just shocked by the fact that. collectively. we have got over $1 trillion of student loan debt here in America. That is a very real number in terms of its implications. as you pointed out. Congressman SWALWELL. for the capacity of younger Americans to robustly pursue the American Dream. When you are saddled with that level of debt burden. it makes it far more difficult to start a family. far more difficult to purchase a home. far more difficult to be part of the next generation of great American entrepreneurs and innovators. because you are less likely to take a risk if you have got this monthly student loan bill that you are unsure as to how you would pay if you were to take some time off to start a business. to invent the next Google or Facebook or Twitter. And so this is really an issue of great significance to us. as Americans. And it is a shame. I will make this last observation. I sat on the Budget Committee for the previous 2 years in the 113th Congress. and the same is the case this year. that Republicans continue to put forth a budget that is not designed to alleviate the problem of higher education affordability. It is designed to make the problem worse. It will cut over $220 billion over a 10year period in Federal Government assistance in a variety of ways to younger Americans who are struggling to get a college education and pursue the American Dream. That is something that we have got to be able to address moving forward or move in a different direction in terms of who the American people send to this Congress to do their business.
1140070168,The big question I think that we face here. earlier today we voted on a tax extender package. $600plus billion. None of it was paid for. at least as it relates to what was done today. I think reasonable people understand that making these tax breaks permanent in a way where they were not paid for ultimately is going to blow a tremendous hole in the deficit. As we move forward. the people who will pay for the tax cuts that were passed out of this House earlier today. hundreds of billions of dollarsnotwithstanding the earned income tax credit and the child care tax credit that. of course. many of us supportthe people who will pay for it will be the poor. the sick. the afflicted. working families. those who need assistance. In good conscience. there is no way that I could support the tax extender package and go back home to my community and say we have just done a good thing. As it relates to the omnibus. I think we all have to ask the question. if the plusup in the omnibus is somewhere in the neighborhood of $31 billion or $32 billion in additional spending. yet we understand that in the tax extender package hundreds of billions of dollars were unpaid for over a 10year period and. ultimately. someone is going to pay the price for thatthat is one of the reasons why we got something like sequestration. We got jammed as a result of tax cuts that were not paid for in 2001. tax cuts that were not paid for in 2003. a failed war in Iraq. a failed war in Afghanistan. None of that was paid for. Ultimately we find ourselves in fiscal difficulty. Who pays? The most vulnerable in America. That is how we got sequestration. So I am not convinced that we are not going to find ourselves in a similar situation moving forward as a result of what was done with this tax extender package today. I am in the process of continuing to review the omnibus bill and trying to weigh and balance the equities. I will tell you. though. that the failure to do something for the people of Puerto Rico is greatly troubling. because it doesnt cost the taxpayers anything. and the fact that some of the programs of importance to urban America. like Historically Black Colleges and Universities. may not have received the resources that some of us think they deserve. and we have got concerns as a result of some of the foreclosure prevention issues in some other areas. We are all going to have to take a look at the equities. but it is clear that we should be able to do much better for the American people. for those that we have come to Congress to represent. for those who have disproportionately borne the burden of reckless and irresponsible fiscal policies over the past decade or so. And lets just hope that we can proceed to do things differently in a way that benefits those we represent here in America. So I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for the opportunity to speak further on this issue. I also want to acknowledge my good friend. KEITH ELLISON. who is a tremendous champion for working families all across the country.
1140074064,Mr. Speaker. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio. Representative BEATTY. my good friend. for those very kind words and. of course. for her tremendous leadership in anchoring and shepherding us here this evening in the same manner that she has done since her arrival here in the House of Representatives. always eloquent. erudite. and effervescent. We appreciate that unique and tremendous combination of skill and ability that you bring to the people that you represent so ably in Columbus. Ohio. and. of course. really. on behalf of America as you stand here anchoring this Congressional Black Caucus Special Orders hour. I look forward to continuing to work together throughout the year as we endeavor to speak truth to power here on the floor of the House of Representatives and articulate issues of significance and importance to African Americans in the United States of America and to all of America. Earlier today I made the observation that this is the first day of Black History Month. Essentially. black history is American history. The two are forever intertwined. That is why the subject matter of this special order is of particular importance. Dr. King once made the observation that the are of the moral universe is long. but it bends toward justice. I think what Dr. King was saying is that in this world you have got some good folks and you have got some bad actors. But in order for justice to prevail. what you essentially need is a fair amount of the good folks to come together. sacrifice. work hard. and dedicate themselves to the cause of social change. and at the end of the day justice will prevail. Make no mistake that in the United States of America. of course. it has been a long and complicated march. We certainly have come a long way. but we still have a long way to go. During the founding of the Republic back in 1776. in the DNA of this great country was embedded the principles of liberty and justice for all. It was a great document and a great start. Embedded in the DNA of this country was fairness. equality. and opportunity for everyone. But there was a genetic defect called chattel slavery that was also attendant to our birth. If you are going to have any discussion about where we are in America today. you have got to recognize there was a genetic defect that has impacted the are of the African American community here in America and the American story. and that genetic defect of chattel slavery stayed with us. of course. until the war ended in 1865. Millions of African American slaves were subjugated. It was one of the worst crimes ever perpetrated in the history of humanity. It finally ended in 1865 with the adoption of the 13th Amendment. Of course. we know that the 14th Amendment and the 15th Amendment followed. equal protection under the law for everyone. 14th Amendment. and the 15th Amendment was designed to guarantee the right to vote. The socalled Reconstruction period lasted until the middle of the 1870s. but it was largely abandoned thereafter. The African Americans. of course. were given a raw. bad deal. How can you cure the genetic defect of chattel slavery with three constitutional amendments without ever really forcefully implementing them and within a decade or so abandoning the principles inherent in those constitutional amendments? In place we received the Black Codes. Jim Crow. segregation. and an intense lynching campaign unleashed on African Americans in the South. in the Midwest. in the far West. and other parts of the United States of America. So we went from chattel slavery. a brief period of Reconstruction. then you give us Jim Crow. So we dealt with Jim Crow which was at least in principle abolished on paper when the Supreme Court makes the decision in Brown v. Board of Education that separate but equal was just a farce. It was a joke. It wasnt real. So the Supreme Court exposes that. but then says. go ahead and implement it with all deliberate speed. Which basically meant dont really implement it with any urgency. any immediacy. any impactful fashion. just take your time and do it at your own pace. So as we are trying to deal with Jim Crow. then you have. of course. Dr. King and leaders of the civil rights movement. JOHN LEWIS. whom Congresswoman BEATTY and I are so privileged to serve with. A. Philip Randolph. Roy Wilkins. James Farmer. and so many others. The civil rights movement deals with the lingering effects of our original genetic defect of chattel slavery replaced by Jim Crow. Then in the 1960s. we get the 1964 Civil Rights Act. the 1965 Voting Rights Act. the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Lyndon Johnsons War on Poverty. and efforts to try to finally correct the injustices that have been race based here in America. Like Reconstruction. which lasted for a little over a decade. we get this period of dramatic social change. mainly in the early and mid1960s that is quickly abandoned and taken advantage of by Richard Nixon in 1968 with the Southern strategy White backlash. particularly in the Deep South. compounded in 1971 when President Richard Nixon makes the statement that drug abuse is public enemy number one. Essentially. the War on Drugs ushered in an era of mass incarceration. When President Nixon made that statement. there were less than 350.000 people incarcerated in America. Today. 40plus years later. after the War on Drugs. so called. was started. 2.3 million people. more than 1 million African American men. disproportionately and adversely impacting communities of color and as has been mentioned earlier. incarcerate more people in America than any other country in the world. a country where we overincarcerate and under educate. We have made a lot of progress in America. African Americans as a collective community really havent been given any room to breathe because we have gone from chattel slaverythe original birth defect in this great Republicto Jim Crow. to mass incarceration with brief periods of Reconstruction and civil rights era mixed in between. And you wonder why we are in the situation that we are in right now. We have made a lot of progress. Obviously the fact that Barack Obama is sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is a significant development. but as Dr. King says. he talked about an are. which means that similar to what Abraham Lincoln once said. that we have to continue a march toward a more perfect Union. the Congressional Black Caucus with leadership from dynamic representatives like JOYCE BEATTY. have put forth a series of things to benefit not just the African American community. but all communities. to help bring the promise of American democracy to life. With that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back to my good friend. Representative BEATTY.
1140074066,It is a great question. Unfortunately sort of the are of history here in this great country of ours is that whenever progress has been made it has been followed by a backlash. Progress was made with the Reconstruction amendments. It was followed by a backlash that gave us Jim Crow. the Black Codes. and an explosion of lynching in the South. Progress. of course. was made in the 1960s with the Civil Rights Act. the Voting Rights Act. the Fair Housing Act immediately followed by Richard Nixons Southern strategy. and a backlash against things like affirmative action which had barely been put into motion and a rollback of the War on Poverty which was designed to help African Americans and all Americans of every race. Then. of course. many thought that we perhaps had reached a postracial America in the aftermath of the election of President Barack Obama. but we know. of course. that that is not the case sadly. I am hopeful. however. that many of my colleagues. Republicans and Democrats. Conservatives and Progressives who have come together. folks like RAUL LABRADOR. TREY GOWDY. and JASON CHAFFETZgood friends of mine on the other side of the aislerecognize the importance of dealing with mass incarceration for America. Here are a few statistics that I think we need to be concerned about as it relates to your question. African Americans serve virtually as much time in prison for a nonviolent drug offense. approximately 58 months. as White Americans do for a violent criminal offense. 62 months. Whites in America statistically use drugs five times as often as African Americans. yet African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of White Americans. Lastly. African Americans represent 83 percent of crack cocaine Federal defendants. but only 28 percent of users83 percent are defendants. 28 percent are users. whereas. White Americans represent 5.8 percent of Federal defendants but 62 percent of users. Something is wrong. Justice is not colorblind in America. So hopefully we will find the ability to come together to deal with the overall broken criminal justice system and certainly as part of that rectify some of the racial disparities that exist.
1140086182,remind us. A concurrent resolution on the budget means it is supposed to pass both the Senate and the House. again. by April 15. At this date. neither Chamber has considered a budget resolution for 2017. Madam Speaker. I dont know about your constituents. but in my district. Ohios Third Congressional District. my constituents expect Congress to work. so lets take a look at it. What happens when people refuse to do their jobs? If postal workers dont deliver. you dont get your mail. If farmers dont farm. people dont eat. If teachers dont show up. our children dont learn. People all over America take their jobs seriously. and they expect us. as their elected officials. to also do that. It is time for House Republicans to get America off the road to ruin and back on the path to prosperity. When Speaker RYAN took officethis is worth repeating. and Congressman JEFFRIES mentioned this earlier. When Speaker RYAN took office. House Republicans stated that passing a budget was a basic function of government. However. the statutory deadline of passing a budget resolution by April 15 has come and gone. although House Republicans made passing a budget a top priority for this year. In the Republicans own words. they cant even accomplish the basic functions of governmenttheir job. Madam Speaker. why do we care that we dont have a budget? Let me give you the answer. The importance of setting a budget is that it lays out the blueprint for the appropriations process. It outlines government spending for the year. Without a budget. we have 12 appropriations bills that are working their way through Congress without there being guiding principles on overall spending. If we cannot as a Congress perform the basic functions of governing. how are we going to tackle the much more complicated issues. such as income inequality. education quality. tuition affordability. tax reform. and so many others? Once again. House Republicans have demonstrated the degree to which the sharp division within their Conference is impeding Congress ability to work for the American people. Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hardworking American families. they have just decided not to pass a budget. This decision was made despite the fact that President Obama submitted his budget request to Congress back in February. As you may remember. Madam Speaker. the Republican majority here in the House of Representatives and the Republicancontrolled Senate took the unprecedented step of refusing to receive the OMB Director for a formal hearing so as to present the Presidents budget. Madam Speaker. how did that turn out for us? We all know how it turned out. The Republican Conference failed the American people. and it set us on a road to ruin by not passing a budget.
1140086199,Mr. Speaker. I thank Representative SCOTT. Let me now ask my colleague. the gentlewoman from Ohio . to just react to some of what we have heard. One of the things that I thought was interesting in the presentation related to this budget is that if you look at the numbers. they are so extreme. I was on the Committee on the Budget during my first 2 years in Congress. but these numbers are even more extreme than what I remember in the 113th Congress. The budget apparently will cut $157 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over a 10year period. The Republican budget that came out of the committee would cut roughly $2 trillion from Medicaid. When I was on the committee. the number was $700 million. I thought that was out of control. $700 million. Now we are at $2 trillion over a 10year period apparently. And then we have got cuts in higher education. The proposal is $185 billion over 10 years. You have to ask the question: Why would anyone propose such draconian cuts? The answer is clear. This is not something that is often talked about. but the objective is to create a situation where you can dramatically lower the tax rates for the wealthiest amongst us. The top tax rate right now is 39.6 percent. but what the budget that has been put forth by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would do is that it would create two tax rates. one at 10 and the other at 25 percent. So what you will see is a tax cut that goes from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. The way that you balance a budget and pay for it is on the backs of working families. the middle class. senior citizens. children. the disabled. the poor. the afflicted. and everybody else who doesnt fall into the category of millionaire or billionaire. Now. you wonder how it could be possible that anyone could think that they could get away with such a draconian budget. Well. again. the argument is trickledown economics. But what I found fascinatingand maybe you could react to this. Representative BEATTYis that if you actually look at a sidebyside comparison of the economy 8 years under President Clinton with a sidebyside comparison of the economy 8 years under George W. Bush. and then a sidebyside comparison of the economy 8 years under President Obama. I think it is pretty clear who actually has been the responsible fiscal stewards. There were 20.3 million jobs created under the Clinton Presidency. America lost 650.000 jobs in 8 years under the Bush Presidency. America has now gained more than 14 million private sector jobs under 8 years of the Obama Presidency. What has been demonstrated is that the argument that if you lower tax rates. you create economic prosperity. is phony. Because Bill Clinton raised the top tax rate to 39.6 percent. It didnt seem to adversely impact the economy. In fact. it was humming between 1992 and 2000. George Bush comes to office. lowers the tax rate for highincome earners from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. We had the greatest recession in the history of modern America. the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. President Obama comes into office and he raises the top tax rate again from 35 to 39.6. more than 14 million jobs are created. the unemployment rate has dropped under his tenure from over 10 percent to 5 percent. the deficit has been reduced by more than a trillion dollars. The stock market has gone from 6.000 to over 16.000. Now it is up to 18.000. I havent been in the 401(k) system as long as Congressman SCOTT. who clearly is monitoring the situation. So the prosperity numbers have been phenomenal. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio
1140086201,I thank you for laying that out. And I think history can be judged by objective observers as it relates to fiscal responsibility. But a few facts that perhaps some in the Chamber may have had amnesia about. but maybe it bears going through. Sequestration and painful budget cuts as it relates to the extreme agenda of some here in the Congress have been brought to us in a manner that has cost us both jobs and the ability to experience accelerated financial growth. We saw in the aftermath of a severe economic shock the approach that was taken by our friends over in Europe of extreme austerity did not bear financial fruit. It was the stimulus package that was put forthwith not a single vote from anyone on the other side of the aislethat was actually the financially responsible approach taken to help deal with the train wreck that President Obama inherited and to get the economy back on track. But. of course. the objective from the very beginningnot my words. but the words of the Senate majority leader on the other side of the Capitolwas to make the President a oneterm President. I just dont even understand the philosophy of a President who takes office. inherits the worst economy since the Great Depression. and the number one agenda is to make sure that he is a oneterm President. But that was an unsuccessful political endeavor. He gets a second term. The first thing that some of my good friends on the other side of the aisle decide to do. as we approach the end of the fiscal year in 2013. was to shut down the government for 16 days. It cost us $24 billion in lost economic productivity. That is not hyperbole. Those are facts. And what was it all for? Because there is this obsessionperhaps clinical in naturewith the Affordable Care Act. This is why we voted more than 50 times to destroy it. defeat it. delay it. and do everything possible to stop it. What could be possibly wrong with making sure that preexisting conditions dont prevent someone here in the greatest country in the history of the world from being able to get adequate medical care? What is wrong with more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans actually having health care? Yet. in the budget that apparently is not extreme enough. we would take away the Affordable Care Act. So these are just some of the facts. I wish we had some more time to explore it. That is not hyperbole. Historians will judge this Presidency and this Congress. I. of course. am of the belief that many will conclude that this is a Congress that has majored in obstruction. minored in dysfunction. and done everything possible to pursue a degree in legislative malpractice to the detriment of the American people. And I am hopeful that we can just get back on track and try to find common ground to do the business of the American people. which is why each and every one of us was sent here to the peoples House. I yield back the balance of my time.

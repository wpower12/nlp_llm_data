1130035351,I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding. Mr. Speaker. my district of Sacramento is one of the leading clean energy economies in the country. The sharp cuts to clean energy initiatives in this bill are deeply troubling. It will no doubt hurt American innovation and American jobs. particularly as other nations continue to invest in clean energy technologies. It is also not reflective of an allofthe -above energy strategy that our Nation desperately needs. At the same time. this bill addresses some of the important flood protection priorities for my district. Sacramento is the most atrisk metropolitan area for major flooding. as it lies at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers. We have a great deal at risk. As the home of the State capital and half a million people. a major flood event in Sacramento would have economic damages of up to $40 billion. I am pleased that this bill includes nearly $70 million in funding for Sacramentos flood protection priorities. including more than $66 million to continue construction on the Folsom Dam Joint Federal Project. In addition. this bill includes report language. which I requested. expressing concern with the Corps current levee vegetation policy. Sacramento is ground zero for the impact of the Corps vegetation policy. Instead of a onesizefitsall solution. the Corps should consider regional variances and local input. as called for under bipartisan legislation I introduce in H.R. 399. the Levee Vegetation Review Act. The bill also includes report language that I also requested expressing concern with the Corps decision to end its section 104 crediting policy. which has halted flood protection projects from moving forward. particularly one in west Sacramento. Mr. Speaker. moving forward. we must also be cognizant that there are other muchneeded public safety projects that remain unfunded and unbuilt due to a lack of a WRDA bill. We urgently need to improve Americas crumbling levee infrastructure. In Sacramento. my constituents have taxed themselves twice and $350 million of construction work is well under way for the Natomas Levee Improvement Project. all while awaiting congressional authorization for over 2 years after receiving a chiefs report from the Army Corps of Engineers. Mr. Speaker. on May 15 the Senate passed a robust WRDA bill with clear bipartisan support of 8314. It is my sincere hope that the House will soon follow suit. We cannot wait until the next disaster takes lives and wrecks our economy. This is a bipartisan issue that must be addressed immediately in Congress.
1130058072,Mr. Speaker. as a member of SEEC. the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition. I rise today to recognize the 1year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy. Today. we remember those who lost their lives during this catastrophe and salute those who continue the rebuilding efforts. One year ago. Sandy ravaged the east coast. producing devastating floods and widespread power outages. disrupting cellular phone networks and transit systems. As a whole. the region suffered over $65 billion in economic losses. Families lost their homes. their precious mementos. and reminders of their daily lives. Communities lost their businesses. Tragically. some individuals lost their lives. While the east coast was the primary victim of Sandy. extreme weather knows no boundaries and other communities around the country are not immune from suffering the same fate. Floods. hurricanes. wildfires. and droughts are becoming all too common. all too intense. and all too costly. These events will continue to wreak economic havoc and uproot families. unless we take meaningful action to address climate change. In California. climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme heat and prolonged drought. placing millions of Californians at greater risk of public health threats such as heatrelated sickness. forest fires. and water scarcity. At home. my constituents live under the constant threat of flooding. which is why I work relentlessly to strengthen our levees and upgrade our infrastructure. If extreme weather caused a levee to be breached in Sacramento. the damage would be similar to that experienced in New Orleans. Mr. Speaker. events like Sandy can happen anywhere. They dont just threaten the coasts. but all communities in all States. Events like Sandy can happen at any timeand are happening with alarming frequency. This was not an isolated event that happens every decade. We cannot continue to sit back and wait for the next disaster to happen before we take action. The time to act is not a year from now. not a month from now. not even a day from now. The time to act is today. We must implement preventative measures to make our communities more resilient and be proactive in addressing climate change. the root cause of extreme weather events. Only then will we be able to safeguard the country from the destructive effects of extreme weather and ensure that the leg-
1130073705,I wish to thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3964. California is currently experiencing a record drought. Up until just last Thursday. it had been 54 days without rain in my district of Sacramento. That is almost 2 months. To put this in context. Sacramento is experiencing a 130year record for low rainfall. a record that dates back to 1884. With 2013 being the driest year on record since the Gold Rush. and 2014 being the third year of a drought cycle. we are being pushed to make do with less water than ever before. A statewide drought emergency has been declared. and my district of Sacramento is doing its part by instituting a mandatory reduction in water use. My constituents are required by law now to reduce their water use 20 to 30 percent. Fines for multiple offenders will reach $1.000. Moreover. in the Sacramento region. the Folsom Reservoir is at dangerously low levels and is currently only at 17 percent of capacity. Unfortunately. there is no silver bullet to solving Californias water issues. The issue of water in California has been debated for so many decades because it is such a critical issue for the State. As a daughter of a Central Valley farmer who grew up on a farm. I deeply understand the value of and the controversy over water. In northern California. we have done our best to balance our watershed to provide water for our farms. cities. and habitat. To say this bill will help the drought is grossly misleading and. frankly. irresponsible. Mr. Speaker. even if we pumped as much water south as possible. it still wouldnt be enough. The problem is a lack of rain. There is simply no more water to pump from the Delta. Mr. Speaker. instead of working together. this bill only further divides our State. My district. the city of Sacramento. the Sacramento region. and northern California as a whole. strongly oppose this bill. Some of the concerns include the loss of the States right to manage its own water. the decimation of environmental protections for our SacramentoSan Joaquin Delta. the ability to manage Folsom Reservoir for the benefit of the Sacramento metropolitan area and. most importantly. the overall instability that this bill would create in California. We cannot afford to give up Californias right to control its own water future. The stakes are much too high. I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this legislation.
1130073852,"Mr. Chairman. my friend on the other side is trying to distract the public on what their bill actually does. H.R. 3964 would not provide any relief from the real drought. but it would instead permanently reallocate water for one interest. Mr. Chairman. the 1992 Central Valley Project Improvement Act designated 800.000 acrefeet of water for environmental purposes. This water is important. It is used to balance our water needs between urban. agricultural. and environment. This socalled ""b2"" water was dedicated to help stem the rapid decline of the delta ecosystem. H.R. 3964 repeals the ""b2"" water allocation in the CVPIA unless 800.000 acrefeet of additional capacity is found by 2018. Who is going to make up the 800.000 acrefeet by 2018? As written. the bill would relieve the south delta CVP users of any responsibility for the environmental water. Instead. it would attempt to shift the responsibilities to northern California. putting into jeopardy senior water rights holders in northern California. Mr. Chairman. my district. the city of Sacramento. and Sacramento County wrote letters stating what we all know. This is a backdoor attempt to undermine longstanding California water rights and let one interest jump to the head of the line. In short. this bill is another blatant water grab from northern California. Mr. Chairman. my amendment will protect senior water rights holders in northern California and assure we are all in this together in California. We should not pit one against another. Again. this bill will not help alleviate the drought. Even if we pumped as much water south as possible. Central Valley farmers still wouldnt have enough. That is because a lack of pumping is not the problem. The problem is a lack of rain and snow. There is no more water to pump. Northern California is in severe drought. This bill does not solve Californias drought. It only further divides our State. Mr. Chairman. again. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. and I reserve the balance of my time."

1140080010,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. The bipartisan bill before us today improves access to quality healthcare providers for vulnerable Medicaid patients. Today. State Medicaid programs too often suffer from waste. fraud. and abuse. which can harm beneficiaries and waste taxpayer dollars. At the same time. too many Medicaid patients may have a hard time finding a doctor. Our bill takes an important step forward in addressing both of these issues. First. H.R. 3716 would ensure healthcare providers that are terminated from Medicaid or from one States Medicaid program for reasons of fraud. integrity. or quality are also terminated from other State Medicaid programs. The Office of Inspector General at HHS has previously found that 12 percent of terminated providers were participating in a State Medicaid program after the same provider was terminated from another State Medicaid program. It is critical that fraudulent providers are not allowed to defraud taxpayers or to harm patients across the board. Medicaid beneficiaries are some of the most vulnerable patients. so our bipartisan bill will ensure that they are better protected. This commonsense bill was reported favorably from our Health Subcommittee and from the full Energy and Commerce Committee last year. The other important aspect of this legislation was authored by CHRIS COLLINS of New York. This provision of the bill requires State Medicaid programs to provide beneficiaries who are served under feeforservice or primary care case management programs an electronic directory of physicians who are participating in the program. Research shows that too often Medicaid patients today have a hard time finding a doctor. The Government Accountability Office has previously found that Medicaid patients face particular challenges in accessing certain types of care. such as obtaining specialty care or dental care. Additionally. the GAO has previously reported that 38 States experienced challenges in ensuring enough participating providers. To help empower Medicaid patients and equip them with better information. this policy would apply requirements similar to those in place for Medicaid managed care plans to feeforservice and/or primary care case management programs. Under the bill. States would be required to list on their Web sites a directory of physicians that would include the physicians name. specialty. address. and telephone number. Additionally. for physicians serving as case managers through the PCCM programs. States would be required to include information on whether a physician is accepting new patients as well as to list the physicians cultural and linguistic capabilities. In a day and age when Medicaid patients can use their phones to search for the nearest gas station or grocery store. it makes good sense to ensure that States are giving patients better information so that they can readily find a doctor near them who accepts Medicaid patients. Finally. according to the Congressional Budget Office. H.R. 3716 would reduce Federal outlays by $15 million over a 10year budget window because the Medicaid program would no longer be paying providers that were terminated for reasons of fraud. integrity. or quality. The CBO does not estimate Statespecific savings. but this bill would also save State Medicaid programs several million dollars over the same timeframe. Mr. Chairman. this legislation provides commonsense reforms that help protect Medicaid beneficiaries. that improve access to care. and that save Federal and State dollars in the Medicaid program. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3716. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140080034,"led the effort to help cut down on fraud by eliminating bad actors. The bipartisan legislation ensures that providers terminated from Medicare or a state Medicaid program for reasons of fraud. integrity. or quality are terminated across the board from all other state Medicaid programs. With a program as large as Medicaid. it will always be a target for fraudsters. but we can work to limit their impact. and this bill is an positive step that will save millions of dollars and send the message loud and clear that bad actors in one state should not be allowed to participate anywhere. period. In addition to reducing fraud. we are helping increase access for those most in need. Finding a doctor is often a difficult task. and Mr. COLLINS led this effort to increase access to care beyond the emergency room. If a state is using a feeforservice or primary case management system to deliver care to Medicaid patients. this bill requires they provide those patients with a directory of physicians. Medicaid managed care plans already provide a network of doctors and nurses to care for patients. This requirement ensures that patients in feeforservice Medicaid programs dont have to fend for themselves. Research has shown that access to doctors can be a problem for Medicaid beneficiaries. so this commonsense step will help ensure beneficiaries are empowered with better information that is more readily available. And thats a good thing. This bill doesnt solve all our problems. but it is a significant bipartisan step forward. And yesterday. the Office of Management and Budget announced the administration ""supports House passage of H.R. 3716 because it improves program integrity for Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program."" Weve got Republicans. Democrats. and the White House all in lockstep supporting meaningful. 21st century reforms for Medicaid. This bill shows that its possible to work together on Medicaid. Id like to once again thank Dr. BUCSHON and Mr. COLLINS. as well as Helath Subcommittee Chairman PITTS and full committee Ranking Member PALLONE. Together. we are building upon the committees proud bipartisan record of success. Lets keep the momentum going to help our most vulnerable folks."

It is no secret that the Hoosier State is home to hardworking. innovative. and compassionate people. In the Eighth District. we are leading the way.

This prestigious award is presented annually to the men and womens college and high school basketball players who achieve great success on the court and solidifies Jackie as the Nations top high school woman basketball player. To us in southern Indiana. the award comes as no surprise. With 3.268 career points. Jackie is Indianas alltime leading scorer. She is a natural leader on and off the court. Congratulations to Jackie. We wish her all the best as she prepares for her next step. playing for Notre Dame. Additionally. a community leader and anchor of our local economy. Toyota Motor Manufacturing. will soon celebrate the 20th anniversary of its ground breaking in Gibson County. Over the past 20 years. the plant has been a leader in economic development for our region. providing thousands of jobs and supporting local organizations. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the hardworking and dedicated team members at Toyota in Princeton. These men and women make quality products in Indiana that are being sold across the country and around the world. and they take pride in doing it. On behalf of all Hoosiers across the Eighth District. I thank everyone at Toyota Motor Manufacturing for your continued commitment to our community and congratulate them on this tremendous milestone.

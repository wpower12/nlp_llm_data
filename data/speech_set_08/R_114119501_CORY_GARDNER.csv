1140036677,"Mr. President. I rise today to discuss the PORTS Act. legislation I have introduced to protect the American economy from crippling labor disputes at our seaports. Somebody asked why a Senator from Colorado was interested in legislation dealing with the work stoppage or slowdown that occurred on our ports on the west coast. Well. I will tell you why. I was contacted by numerous businesses and people that had their entire furniture lines taken out of their furniture stores. I talked to ranchers who had to face threats of a $1 billion ag export market. I talked to onion growers who watched as their domestic commodity prices crashed due to the port slowdown. I watched as stories were written in newspapers about apple growers in Washington unable to export apples so they dumped apples just to rot in the fields in Washington State. Trade through U.S. seaports is critical. We have been spending weeks on this floor and the floor of the House talking about the TransPacific Partnership and talking about the importance of trade promotion authority. and none of that is possible without an active. successful port system in this country. According to the American Association of Port Authorities. U.S. ports support 23 million jobs. and the value of related economic activity accounts for 26 percent of our national gross domestic product. Contract negotiations and related labor disputes at our ports clog up these vital arteries and lead to delays. higher costs. and lost business for industries throughout our country. Strikes. lockouts. and slowdowns may have been business as usual for labor unions in the past. but an increasingly global economy means that the collateral damage done to American workers and businesses has increased exponentially. The U.S. economy recently endured a 9month labor dispute that affected all 29 of our west coast ports. The resulting logistical nightmare caused delays. higher costs. and lost businesses for industries in Colorado and throughout the United States. Ships full of cargo were anchored off our coast waiting for longshoremen to do their job on unloading international goods and loading Americanmade products for shipment to markets across the world. In Los Angeles and Long Beach alone. dozens of container ships sat anchored and idle. After 9 months and huge financial costs to our national economy. the parties reached an agreement in February to allow cargo to begin moving normally through the west coast ports again. Four months later. we are finally seeing that congestion beginning to ease. but it has taken this long. Many economists. including the Federal Reserve Board of Governors cited the labor dispute as a primary cause of the 0.7percent decline in GDP in the first quarter of 2015. That means 29 west coast ports were primarily responsible for a 0.7percent decline in GDP. Agricultural exports. including apples. hay. and Christmas trees lost export opportunities to overseas customers because they couldnt get products to market. Meat and poultry companies lost sales and faced port charges in excess of $30 million per week. Retail shipments were delayed from reaching store shelves. and some stores resorted to expensive air freight to stock goods. Manufacturers waiting on shipments had to shut down production lines and risked losing contracts with foreign customers. Colorado supplies Asia with over $500 million in beef products through the west coast ports. which accounts for about 23 percent of Colorados total exports and 57 percent of Colorados international exports. These and other meat and poultry exporters saw many of their products spoil as shipments were turned away at the port gates. Grain. machine parts. coal. fishing supplies. furniture. fresh produce. and pliable metals are all products of Colorado. and all were damaged by the labor dispute. Our exporters relationships with Asian customers disintegrated as their orders were caught in the bottleneck. And storefronts lost customers because products took months to reach show floors. When Congress enacted TaftHartley nearly 70 years ago. Congress decided the health and reputation of the greatest economy in the world should not be used as leverage in labor contract negotiations. The opening statement of the act explains that Congress intended to minimize ""industrial strife which interferes with the normal flow of commerce."" That means current law had provided a remedy. but unfortunately the administration did not use it. Under that very provision of TaftHartley. when a labor dispute threatens the national economy. the President is empowered to use the Federal courts to seek an injunction to end labor practices causing widespread disruptions. With 70 years of case law backing it up. this is a triedandtrue process that ensures that the selfinterests and greed of a few does not impact the livelihoods of the many. Yet. when the west coast ports dispute threatened businesses and entire industries in States across the country. the President refused to act. For months. the Federal Executive decided not to exercise his authority under TaftHartley. depriving the country of critical dispute resolution powers. Legislation I have introduced. known as the PORTS Act. prevents this kind of economic disruption. It would discourage disruptions at U.S. ports by strengthening and expanding the wellknown TaftHartley process. As we saw recently. the President of the United States may not be willing to adequately protect the economic rights and interests of American citizens. The PORTS Act would solve this by granting State Governors TaftHartley powers currently reserved for the President. A Governor from any State would have the opportunity to form a board of inquiry and start the TaftHartley process whenever a port labor dispute is causing economic harm. Once the board reports back. any Governor can petition Federal courts to enjoin slowdowns. strikes or lockouts at ports in their State. The act would also explicitly include slowdowns as a trigger for TaftHartley powers. preventing the President or Governors from using legal ambiguity to excuse an action. As a result. this legislation would give a stronger voice to local leaders by allowing those who are most affected by disruptionslocal community leaders. business. employees. and consumersto apply pressure on their Governors rather than trying to mobilize a national campaign to convince the President to act. In just 5 years. the labor contracts at both the east coast and the west coast ports will expire. possibly leading to labor disputes on both ends of the country. When the health of the national economy is threatened. the Federal Government has a duty to act. but it is clear the current TaftHartley powers depend too heavily on who controls the Presidency. It is critical that we have the necessary tools in place to prevent another debilitating crisis. So I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. Countless retail organizations. individual businesses. and people across this country recognize the need to avoid in 5 years simultaneous slowdowns or shutdowns on the east and west coastswhat we just went through. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140038182,"Mr. President. as we are moving toward concluding debate on trade promotion authority. I rise to speak about what the TransPacific Partnership will mean for our Nations global standing. As we have heard throughout this debate. the potential economic benefits from TPP for our Nation are simply enormous. According to the Congressional Research Service. total trade in goods between TPP member countries reached $1.6 trillion in 2014. that is. the nations represented in TPP. $1.6 trillion in trade between those countries. representing nearly 40 percent of all global trade. In my own State of Colorado. trade with countries involved in TPP currently supports over 265.000 jobs. The nations represented by the TPP agreementthe negotiations that are taking place right now265.000 jobs in Colorado result from those nations. But we know the TPP is more than just an economic agreement. It is a critical test of U.S. strategic leadership in the AsiaPacific region. a region that will be integral to our economic and national security for generations to come. As stated in the 2015 National Security Strategy: Sustaining our leadership depends on shaping an emerging global economic order that continues to reflect our interests and our values. Despite its success. our rulesbased system is now competing against alternative. lessopen models .... To meet this challenge. we must be strategic in the use of our economic strength to set new rules of the road. strengthen our partnerships. and promote inclusive development. Those are important words from the National Security Strategy issued just this year. Defense Secretary Ash Carter echoed that sentiment when he said on April 6. 2015. the ""TPP is as important to me as another aircraft carrier."" If we fail to pass the TPP. we know others will rush to fill the vacuum left behind with such ""alternative. lessopen models."" as the National Security Strategy laid out. So we should not be surprised when a rising China tries to fill the vacuum and that they would. indeed. exert efforts to fill that vacuum with policies and programs crafted from their own vision of what is beneficial for themselves and their region. Lets take Chinas recent establishment of the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank. the AIIB. as an example. On the face of it. the AIIB is a positive response to address the infrastructure challenges in the region. It is also the clearest evidence yet that the United States faces a very serious credibility gap in the AsiaPacific region. The AIIB is envisioned as a $100 billion enterprise. with China as the largest shareholder that will hold veto power over major investment decisions. Its rules of governance and standards remain unclear. Yet 56 nations. including some of the strongest U.S. allies. including the United Kingdom. Australia. South Korea. have indicated they will join the Chineseled AIIB. We need to understand why. Do they believe the AIIB is primarily an economic opportunity for their companies? They might. But I would contend that the reason is a lack of leadership from the United States. again going back to that credibility gap. China is also part of ongoing negotiations for another regional trade pact. the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. which would join China. Australia. India. Japan. New Zealand. and South Korea with nations comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN. In addition to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Beijing is also entering negotiations to consider 6 agreements comprised of an additional 11 countries. That brings Chinas total trade agreement portfolio to 33 countries. While the United States should continue bilateral and multilateral economic engagement with China that brings high levels of transparency and accountability. the fundamental question before us today is this: Do we want the United States or do we want China writing the rules? It is clear that while our partners and allies in the region may welcome additional Chinese investment. they want more American leadership. not less. They want more American standards. not fewer. We know the standards TPP and U.S. engagement brings include not only important economic benefits. such as removal of tariff or nontariff barriers. but fundamental American values such as transparency. good governance. respect for the rule of law. and basic human rights. U.S. economic statecraft in the AsiaPacific reflects our values and cements our leadership in the critically important region. We must look at TPP as just one step forward in this enduring commitment. Despite the crises of the day that are occurring in the Middle East. where the United States does and should play an important role. our Nations future lies in Asia. Just consider the following estimates from the Asian Development Bank. By 2050. Asia will account for over half of the global population and over half of the worlds gross domestic product. The Asian middle class will rise to a staggering 3 billion people. Per capita GDP income in the region will rise to around $40.000. making it similar to the Europe of today. We cannot miss the opportunity to be a part of this historic transformation. Working with Japan and regional partners. we must ensure that our policies strengthen existing friendships and build new partnerships that will be critical to U.S. national security and economic wellbeing for generations to come. Unfortunately. the administrations efforts to date with regard to the AsiaPacific region have fallen short. While I commend the Presidents leadership on TPP and our Asia rebalance. which many of us agreed to. the Asia rebalance policy has yielded few tangible results. and it is in need of a serious overhaul. The administration has consistently stated that the rebalance represented a ""whole -ofgovernment"" effort to redirect U.S. military. diplomatic. and commercial service resources toward the AsiaPacific region. But in April of 2014. just a year ago. the Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a report stating that ""while the United States has successfully moved forward with the initial phases of implementing the military aspects of the rebalance."" the State Department and the Department of Commerce have not substantially prioritized their resources to increase engagement with the AsiaPacific region. The report concluded that ""the administration can improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the rebalance policy by increasing civilian engagement. strengthening diplomatic partnerships. and empowering US businesses."" It is clear we need an integrated. multiyear planning and budget strategy for a rebalancing of the U.S. policy in Asia. That is why I was proud to offer an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that passed unanimously that would require the President to submit a strategy within 120 days to promote U.S. interests in the AsiaPacific region. Our partners in the region must know every day that the United States is here to stay. The TPP is the first step in the process. This is an important debate that we have this week. Later on today. we will have the opportunity to vote for trade promotion authority. I hope this Chamber will see the wisdom of passing that legislation265.000 jobs in Colorado from a region responsible for TPP. responsible for increasing economic opportunity. increasing wage growth. and the number of jobs that we have not only in Colorado but around this country. I yield the floor."
1140043484,"Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Tennessee for their leadership over the past several dayslast week and this weekas we talk about the future of education in this country. I commend them for creating a bill that takes away the Federal Governments mandates on curriculum and direction and makes sure we provide local control to school districts and teachers. As a father myself of a student who is going into the sixth grade. I have heard a lot about tests over the past several years. and I want to commend the leadership for making sure we are actually getting Congress out of the classroom. So I appreciate my colleagues leadership. Today I want to talk about an amendment accepted in the education bill we are dealing with here today that deals with the use of title I funds for concurrent and duel enrollment programs at eligible schools throughout the country. According to the Georgetown Public Policy Institute. by 2020. 65 percent of the jobs available in the country today will require secondary education. In Colorado. that number is even higher. Again. by 2020. 65 percent of our jobs will require secondary education. In Colorado. that number is going to be greater. The Colorado Department of Education estimates it is not just 65 percent of the jobs that require a secondary education in Colorado by 2020. It will actually be 74 percent of the jobs in our State that are going to require some form of postsecondary education. Ensuring that our students have the skills necessary to excel in college and in the workforce is absolutely and by far and away the best way to address this concern so we can make sure that we are providing our students with successful futures. Concurrent enrollment and dual enrollment programs have a proven record of success in this arena. I was in the State legislature in Colorado when we embarked on the first concurrent enrollment ideas that came out of the legislature and that have been greatly successful. But we know it is not just the anecdotes from Colorado. but it is the American Institutes for Research that finds that participation in concurrent and dual enrollment programs reduces the number of students dropping out of high school. increasing a students likelihood of entering college. making sure they complete college. and getting through to a career. But our challenge today is that an astounding number of students need to take remedial courses when they enter college. Sitting down with junior college leaders and community college presidents and talking to our universities. they all tell stories about how many students come from high schools to their college or to their campus requiring remedial work in English or mathematics. According to a report by testing organization ETS. nearly onehalf of U.S. millennials scored below the threshold that indicates proficiency in literacy. and twothirds of U.S. millennials missed the cutoff mark in math proficiency. Students are discouraged from continuing college when they are required to take coursesnobody wants to go on to college and take the same coursethat you thought you had completed in high school. But concurrent and dual enrollment will help solve this problem by allowing students to participate in collegelevel courses. which. upon completion. will ensure that these students are indeed proficient. Not only does concurrent and dual enrollment allow proficiency. but it allows students to get ahead of the curve and doing so while in high school. A study by the National Education Longitudinal Study found that concurrent and dual enrollment participants were 16 to 20 percent more likely to complete a bachelors degree than their counterparts. Research shows that students who participate in concurrent and dual enrollment programs complete their degrees earlier than their counterparts as well. A study in 2010 by Kristen Klopfenstein. a Colorado native and graduate of the University of Texas. found that ""the results of taking one or more concurrent or dual credit class tripled the likelihood of graduating from associate programs in three years in relation to students who did not take such courses who typically graduate in four years."" ""Dual enrollment participation was also positively correlated to completing bachelors degrees in four and five years. relative to students who did not take such courses who typically take longer to graduate."" These are the types of programs that reward students for their hard work and prepare them for their college career and success. Many people recognize that courses that provide college credit are typically taken by highachieving students already on the path to college. A lot of college courses that we see are filled with people we knew were destined for college in the first place. But I think we have to talk about the times where that is not the case. where college courses were taken by people who perhaps never thought they had college in their future. I will share one such story today. We were visited in the office not too long ago by a young woman from Colorado who told her story about how concurrent enrollment in Colorado really opened the doors to a college future and a college degree she never thought was possible. The community where I come from is not one that promises a bright future. I am from a low income area of Denver. CO. and we werent expected to go to college. I had always known I wanted to pursue higher education. but was nervous that I wouldnt have the skills to succeed. Fortunately for me. because of concurrent enrollment I was able to get ahead in college for free. I graduated high school with all of my high school credits along with 15 credit hours of college credits. Concurrent enrollment has helped me in phenomenal ways. It gave me the confidence to know I had the capabilities to succeed in college. In addition. with the high cost of college I was able to save money. I am now a student at Colorado State University and made the Deans list this semester. I am on track to graduate early and it would never have been possible without the programs I participated in in high school. I want to spread the word so other students can benefit from concurrent enrollment the way that I have. Every young person who wants to go to college should have the opportunity to attend. and Im thankful I had the opportunity to do so. Those arent my words. Those are the words of a Coloradan whose future was made brighter by the fact that she was able to take advantage. while in high school. of college credit classes. Stories like this are why we have to make sure that. not just Coloradans. but everyone across this country. is able to use title I programs in the same beneficial manner. So the amendment we offered and that has been accepted. thanks to the work of Senator ALEXANDER. our great chairman. and Ranking Member PATTY MURRAY. would empower students to use these kinds of programs and would allow schools to use title I funds for concurrent and dual enrollment programs. enabling students to simultaneously receive college credit from courses taught by college -approved teachers in secondary education. It would allow eligible schools to use fifthyear program partnerships with institutions of higher education to allow students to participate in concurrent enrollment in the year directly following their senior year of high school. Earning a postsecondary degree has become a prerequisite for jobs in the 21st century. Going back to the statistics that we shared in the very beginning. 74 percent of jobs in Colorado will require. by the year 2020. a postsecondary education degree. As we face more competition in the global workplace. as we face more competition abroad. we have to have the kinds of education and educational opportunities that give the next generation of business leaders. innovators. and entrepreneurs the skills to succeed. I believe the concurrent and dual enrollment high school program not only gives them the types of skills they need while in high school but the opportunity to further a college degree and perhaps. as in the story I shared earlier today from that young Coloradan. the chance to go to college. the chance to receive a degree. and to prove they have that bright future. That is what this policy is about. That is what this amendment has been about. Again. I thank the chairman for the consideration and acceptance of the amendment. I yield the floor."
1140045063,"Mr. President. I rise to speak about the west coast port slowdown and comments that were made by the administration as they relate to that slowdown. along with legislation I have introduced called the PORTS Act. legislation I hope to pursue during the transportation debate we are going to commence with over the next several days and also as it relates to that west coast port slowdown. the economic impact that slowdown had on our economy. On June 30 of last year. the labor contract that covered nearly 20.000 workers at 29 west coast ports expired. Port management and the ILWU began negotiations a year before. but in September of 2014 those talks ground to a standstill. Instead of remaining at the table and trying to find a solution and negotiating in good faith. both parties decided to begin jockeying for leverage. The longshoremen purposefully slowed down their work and drastically decreased productivity while still taking home a full days pay. In the real world. employees cant show up at work and not do their work or slow it down dramatically. not have the productivity they are expected to. and still get everything they want. but in the back worlds of labor union politics at the ports. that is business as usual. And business has been good at the ports. According to employer data. a fulltime longshoreman earns about $130.000 a year. fulltime employment $130.000 a year. while foremen earn about $210.000. That is a pretty good paycheck. and the contract raises these wages even higher. Workers pay nothing for health coverage that includes no premiums and $1 prescriptions. Providing this health care costs employers about $35.000 per employee per year. They are also eligible for a maximum pension of over $80.000 per year upon retirement. so $130.000 salary for a longshoreman. $210.000 if you are a foreman. $35.000 for health benefits. and $80.000 per year worth of pension upon retirement. But what happened for the rest of us this past year when the slowdown occurred on the 29 west coast ports. the effect of the slowdowns werent just limited to the port owners. When the longshoremen decided to slow down their work. the goods flowing through these ports backed up and international trade ground to a halt. This has had devastating economic impacts in States far beyond the west coast and around the Nation as a whole. Nine excruciating months after the labor contract expired. the parties finally reached a deal but not before costing U.S. businesses and consumers billions upon billions of dollars and ruining the credibility of our exporters abroad. When it comes to the administration. though. the response was pretty alarming as well. Labor Secretary Perez was just asked about this economic disaster of the west coast ports slowdown when visiting the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. His response: ""The collective bargaining process worked."" As a result of the west coast port slowdown. the administrations response was: ""The collective bargaining process worked."" The Labor Secretary made these comments while visiting Los Angeles. Long Beach. the two busiest ports of the country. So lets take a look at what the collective bargaining process did at those ports. This is a ship finder map of Los Angeles and Long Beach showing ships anchored offshore this week. This is recent data. These are ships that are anchored off the shore of Los Angeles and Long Beach just this past week. This is what it looks like when the ports are operating and functioning normally. You will notice there is a lot of blue ocean and not many ships anchored offshore. Ships can quickly unload imported products and load Americanmade exports for distribution around the world. There is no backup. no congestion. and no disruption to our countrys economy. But this is what Los Angeles and Long Beachthe ports of Los Angeles and Long Beachlooked like during the slowdown during the crisis. Dozens upon dozens of ships anchored and idled waiting for ships in port to be unloaded. You can see all the ships that are backed up compared to the previous chart. The Journal of Commerce reported that there were 32 ships anchored off the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach at one point during the slowdown. There has been a lot of discussion recently about the need for a longterm surface transportation bill that invests in 21st century infrastructure. but just take a look at the kind of dysfunction antiquated labor laws can cause. This is an aerial shot. You can see this is off the wing of an airplane where you can see all of the ships that are backed up waiting at these ports to be unloaded. ships that carry the goods for our economy. the goods that make our economy run. Congestion like this is a nightmare for American farmers. businesses. and consumers. Farm exporters were charged exorbitant fees for warehouse space to store their agricultural goods as they rotted and spoiled. Meat and poultry companies alone faced port charges in excess of $30 million per week. So if people were earning $130.000 a year and not doing their work unloading ships. American farmers. poultry. and meat producers were charged $30 million per week. Businesses further up the supply chain were also affected. One large U.S. base manufacturer has calculated the cost of lost sales. warehouse space. additional inventory. and transportation at $100 million in total as a result of the delays at the west coast ports. Those are just the direct costs. American businesses also lost credibility and future customers as the foreign buyers turned to other nations for more stable supplies. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the west coast port delays forced layoffs and downsizing in the U.S. leather industry. Chinese tanners are now turning to European and Brazilian producers to fill their orders. This is a $3 billion industry that had to lay off workers because of the dispute of the west coast ports. Apparently. the administration again thinks the process worked just as it was supposed to work. Efficient trade through U.S. ports is critical to maintaining and growing economic opportunity in States across this country. According to the American Association of Port Authorities. U.S. ports support 23 million jobs. and the value of related economic activity accounts for 26 percent of our national GDP. Twentysix percent of our national GDP comes from our ports system. Contract negotiations related to labor disputes at our ports clog up these vital arteries and cause problems throughout our national supply chain. If you need further proof of whether this impacted our economythat picture we just saw of all the ships stacked up at L.A. and the ports in Californiaaccording to Federal Reserve economists. the disruptions on the west coast were great enough to affect the entire economic output of the country. This chart shows the quarterly change in national GDP. Once negotiations stalled. you will notice GDP growth started to decline. So here we are in the third quarter of 2014. Remember. we started talking about September of 2014. when the slowdowns really started. By the time we get to the last quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. you can see the labor dispute contributing to the decline of our national GDP. Our economy shrank as a result of port slowdown. In the first quarter of this year. when the slowdowns were in full swing. the economy actually shrank by 0.2 percent. You can see it. in the third quarterthis is the last quarterto the first quarter of this year. Twentysix percent of our GDP depends on these ports. The Fed economists also found that disruptions disproportionately affected exporters sending Americanmade goods abroad for sale overseas. Exporters didnt have access to imported raw materials and parts they needed to build their products. This caused supply chains to back up and eventually reduced output and employment. So the Fed is telling us that the collective bargaining process at the ports measurably reduced economic growth and American jobs across the country by crippling American businesses. but only in the backward worlds of labor union politics could this economic disaster be considered everything is working just fine. Only in a uniondominated industry could this catastrophe be considered a success. That is why I have introduced the PORTS Act. Our legislation would discourage disruptions at U.S. ports and incentivize speedy resolution of disputes by strengthening and expanding the wellknown TaftHartley process. Over 100 national agricultural. manufacturing. and retail organizations support the PORTS Act because they are fed up with the status quo. They disagree with the administration. which thinks shrinking our economy is everything working just fine. There are some who oppose the PORTS Act. and those are the labor unions. In fact. earlier this month. the AFLCIO put out a statement saying legislation like the PORTS Act was not needed. You can see what has happened without the PORTS Act is economic decline. people being laid off. farmers losing millions of dollars. products rotting in warehouses because of the backups. In just 5 yearsS years from nowthe labor contracts on both the east coast and the west coast will expire. Imagine what would happen if we had labor disputes occurring on the west coast and the east coast at the same time. people who were willing to threaten that 26 percent of our national GDP over a dispute. while the administration says everything is working just fine. It is critical we have the necessary tools in place to prevent another debilitating crisis. If we learned anything from this past dispute. it is that Labor Secretary Perez is wrongthe current process does not work. And the AFLCIO is wronglegislation like the PORTS Act is desperately needed. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting this important legislation. Let us not pinch our economy in an economic vice from the east and the west. Lets find economic opportunity to grow our Nation together. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140046319,Mr. President. today I honor the veterans of Honor Flight Northern Colorado that have made their 14th trip to Washington. DC to visit the memorials that stand in our Nations Capital. This group includes veterans from various wars and generations. but all are linked by their service to our country. Ten years ago. the Honor Flight was created to fly veterans that had served in World War II to Washington. DC so they could visit their memorial located in our Nations Capital. Now. the Honor Flight welcomes veterans from all over the country to fly to Washington. DC. free of charge. to visit the memorials of the wars these heroic veterans fought. Of the 123 veterans on the most recent Honor Flight. 25 served in World War II. 59 served in Korea. and 39 served in Vietnam. Few words are sufficient to show the gratitude and respect we all have for the courageous men and women who have fought for our country. They have preserved our rights to life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness. We stand here today to honor those who have risked their lives to protect the United States of America.

1140066141,"Mr. President. I come to the Senate floor today to talk about the broken promises of ObamaCare and the negative impacts this poorly written law have had on my State of Colorado. While there have been many broken promises of ObamaCare. there have been three major broken promises that are the center of focus for hundreds of thousands of Coloradans. I want to start with broken promise No. 1. If you like your plan. you can keep it. The President said over 35 times that Americans shouldnt worry about ObamaCare because if you like your plan. then you can keep it. And it wasnt just the President. time after time. supporters of ObamaCare came to the floor of the House or the Senate or before townhalls in their States or districts and repeated those words: If you like your plan. you can keep it. In fact. these words were used to justify the reason they supported ObamaCare in the first place. Coloradans quickly learned this promise was far from the truth. In late 2013. roughly 335.000 insurance policies in Colorado were canceled because of ObamaCare. These cancellations also affected my family health care plan. Unfortunately. the cancellations in 2013 were the very beginning. In January of 2014. the Colorado Division of Insurance canceled an additional 249.000 plans because those plans didnt meet the requirements of ObamaCare. The President said: If you like your plan. you can keep it. Supporters in Congress said: If you like your plan. you can keep it. But what he meant was. as long as the government approves of your plan. you can keep it. In 2015. an additional 190.000 plans were canceled. In total. according to the Congressional Research Service. over 750.000 health insurance perhaps plans in Colorado were canceled between 2013 and 2015. The factchecking organization PolitiFact said this promise was ""impossible to keep"" and went on to deem President Obamas promise that if you like your health care plan. you can keep it the ""Lie of the Year"" for 2013. Supporters of ObamaCare will tell you that it is OK that this happened because these 750.000 individuals must have had inferior health insurance and that the government knows best. You see. that is the exact problem with government. That is the arrogance of government and the arrogance of ObamaCarethat people in the government. bureaucrats and others. believe they know better than the American consumers what is best for them. They believe it is OK to cancel 750.000 policies because they must have been bad. so go ahead and cancel them. They will also say that it is all right because there are additional plans they can choose from. But that wasnt the promise of ObamaCare. Broken promise No. 1: If you like your health care plan. you can keep it. Broken promise No. 2: ObamaCare will reduce the costs for families. businesses. and our government. Remember. when ObamaCare was passed. they said the family would save $2.500 a year relatively soon after its passage. Unfortunately. Coloradans have felt that broken promise as well. It is a broken promise that hit their pocketbooks and has broken the bank as well. For example. take the Western Slope of Colorado. I have a chart here. According to the Colorado Division of Insurance. individual insurance premiums for 2016 on the Western Slope of Colorado will rise by an additional average of 25.8 percent. There are people across America who are familiar with Colorados Western Slope. These are the incredible mountain vistas. our forests. our national parks. our ski resorts. They received a 25.8percent increase in their health care costs this year. That is far from the promise of lowering the health care costs that ObamaCare was passed with. No one can afford these high prices. In fact. in 2013 one of my Democratic colleagues in the Colorado delegation even tried to exempt one of the wealthiest counties in Colorado from ObamaCare. citing that health insurance premiums would be too expensive. Let me say that again. A Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. a Democrat. tried to exempt portions of his district from ObamaCare because it was making his constituents pay too much for their insurance. Here is a quote: We will be encouraging a waiver. It will be difficult for Summit County residents to become insured. For the vast majority. its too high a price to pay. It doesnt matter whether you live in the Eastern Plains. Fort Collins. or the Western Slope. ObamaCare has simply made it more costly. Plans are getting more expensive. and promises are being broken. Broken promise No. 3: President Obama promised greater competition in the marketplace through consumerrun coops. Yet over 80.000 Coloradans are feeling the impacts of this broken promise. To date. 12 out of 23 coops created by ObamaCare have been shut down across the United States. including the coop in Colorado. which failed in October of this year. Nationwide. the failed coops were loaned over $1 billion. which came from the hardworking taxpayers of this country. That taxpayer money was supposed to help get these coops off the ground. but now with these failures. that taxpayer money is at risk of never being paid back to the people of this country. and the health care of nearly 700.000 individuals across the United States is in jeopardy. ObamaCare allowed policies to be offered that were never actuarially sound because they assumed there would be a bailout by the government to help make them actuarially sound. By banking on a bailout. they sold the American people a bill of goods. Today we have a path forward that is turning away from the failed health care law that has been built on broken promises. The first step of this path forward is to repeal ObamaCare. and I urge my colleagues to support the repeal of ObamaCare that we will be voting on this week. Repealing ObamaCare will clear the way for a replacement plan and will put our countrys health care on the right track. First. we have to restore the ability of individuals to choose what is best for themselves instead of having Big Government choose for them. Coloradans dont want Dr. Congress. They want to keep the doctor they were promised they could keep in the first place. The best way to do this is to ensure that people get to keep the health plans that they want. and that is why I am working with Senator RON JOHNSON from Wisconsin on his amendment that simply says that if you like your health care plan. you can keep it. I heard from countless individuals in Colorado who lost the plans they liked and wanted to keep. They were certainly promised they could keep them. and just because ObamaCare cant fulfill the promise that it was sold under doesnt mean we shouldnt do our jobs to make that promise a reality. The amendment Senator JOHNSON and I have offered would allow individuals to continue receiving health coverage on plans that would otherwise be canceled because of ObamaCare. Second. we must ensure that taxpayer dollars are used responsibly. I filed an amendment that will help recover taxpayer money that was loaned to the failed coops. More than $1 billion in Federal loans were awarded to these failed coops. Congress has a duty to spend taxpayer dollars responsibly. and this amendment will ensure just that. Lastly. we must make sure individuals have certainty in the health coverage they choose. My final amendment will make certain that coops cant rely on bailouts when they are calculating insurance premiums. setting false expectations for consumers. Several coops counted on these bailout provisions to keep premiums artificially low. Because these premiums were artificially low and since many coops were planning on receiving the bailout. many could no longer cover their expenses. Allowing coops to rely on a bailout was irresponsible and has resulted in nearly 700.000 individuals nationwide whose health coverage is now uncertain. It is time to act. It is time to take the path forward. It is time to repeal ObamaCare. which is simply one big broken promise after another. This path to repeal ObamaCare will allow us to replace ObamaCare and will have fewer health care regulations for businesses and individuals. It will put us on a path forward for individual freedoms and a more prosperous America. I yield back my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140076752,"Mr. President. I want to add to the comments made by Chairman CORKER. my colleague from Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. as well as Senator CARDIN. my colleague on the Subcommittee on East Asia. about the work we have done over the past year to put this before the Senate today. One of the first meetings we held in the office of Chairman CORKER was to speak with my colleagues on the concern we shared about North Korea. the concern that while we have rightfully focused on the Middle East and the conflicts that have arisen in Syria and in various places around the country. at the same time we cannot take our eyes off of North Korea. Of course. Senator CARDIN from Maryland and I have worked together on a variety of committee hearings. The first series of committee hearings we held on the East Asia Subcommittee were to address cyber security issues. the cyber attacks from North Korea. and the situation in regard to security on the North Korean Peninsula. I think the work we have laid out over the past year is setting ground for this strong sanctions bill today. I rise to speak in support of H.R. 757. the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act. as amended by the unanimous amendment that came out of the Foreign Relations Committee on January 28. This legislation is a momentous achievement. and I thank the members of the committee and particularly Senator MENENDEZ for working closely with me as we came together with a strong bipartisan solution to what is the problem with North Korea. I also thank House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman ED ROYCE. the sponsor of the underlying House legislation. for his years of tireless work and dedication on this issue. Having served with Chairman ROYCE in the House for a number of years. I know his passion and his dedication and his commitment to bringing peace to the peninsula. This legislation comes at a critical time. Those of you who had a chance to see the news this morning woke up to a story in Reuters where yet another top military official in the Kim Jong Un regime was assassinated by Kim Jong Un. following a long list of others in his administration who have been killed. assassinated. tortured. including his own uncle. including those who have been killed by antiaircraft guns. North Korea poses a serious and growing threat to its neighbors. our allies. South Korea. Japan. and others. It poses a threat to our homeland. the United States. and to global security. While the threat is growing daily. our policies are failing to deter the forgotten maniac in Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un. This past weekend. on February 7. North Korea conducted a satellite launch. which is essentially a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that would be capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Last month. on January 6. North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. which is the third such test during the Obama administration. Moreover. North Korea has claimed that this test was a test of a thermonuclear device. also known as a hydrogen bomba vastly more powerful weapon than the atomic devices the regime has tested in the past. Regardless of whether the claim that it was a hydrogen bomb is true. this test represents a significant advancement in North Koreas nuclear weapons capability. North Korea has violated a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions. including Resolutions 1718. 1874. 2087. and 2094all while the regimes stockpile of nuclear weapons continues to grow exponentially. Most recently. nuclear experts have reported that North Korea may currently have as many as 20 nuclear warheads. with potential for over 100 in the next few years. Yesterday James Clapper. the Director of National Intelligence. testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that North Korea has restarted its plutonium reactor at Yongbyon and ""could begin to recover plutonium from the reactors spent fuel within a matter of weeks to months."" The regimes ballistic missile capabilities are rapidly advancing. DNI Clapper stated that ""North Korea has also expanded the size and sophistication of its ballistic missiles forcesfrom closerange ballistic missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBMs]-and continues to conduct missile test launches .... Pyongyang is also committed to developing a longrange. nucleararmed missile that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United States."" ADM Bill Gortney. the head of U.S. Northern Command. NORTHCOM. which is based in my home State of Colorado. at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. has publicly stated that North Korea may have already developed the ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. mount it on their own intercontinental ballistic missilesomething called the KN08and ""shoot it at the homeland."" Those are not the words of a committee chairman or the words of a subcommittee chairman. those are the words of our commander of NORTHCOM. who believes that they may have developed the ability to shoot it at the homeland. North Korea has demonstrated time and time again that it is an aggressive. ruthless regime that is not afraid to kill innocent people. On March 26. 2010. North Korean missiles sank a South Korean ship. killing 46 of her own crew. and several months later. North Korea shelled a South Korean island. killing 4 more South Korean citizens. Pyongyang is also quickly developing its cyber capabilities as another dangerous tool of intimidation. as demonstrated by the attack on the South Korean financial institutions and communication systems in March of 2013 or the Sony Pictures hack attack in November of 2014. According to a November 2015 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""North Korea is emerging as a significant actor in cyberspace with both its military and clandestine organizations gaining the capability to conduct cyber operations."" According to the Heritage Foundation: Contrary to perceptions of North Korea as a technically backward nation. the regime has a very robust and active uyber warfare capability. The Reconnaissance General Bureau. North Koreas intelligence agency. oversees 3.000 ""cyberwarriors"" dedicated to attacking Pyongyangs enemies. A South Korean cyber expert assessed that North Koreas electronic warfare capabilities were surpassed only by the United States and Russia. We should also never forget that this regime remains one of the worlds foremost abusers of human rights. The North Korean regime maintains a vast network of political prison camps where as many as 200.000 men. women. and children are confined to atrocious living conditions and are tortured. maimed. and killed. On February 7. 2014. the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights released a groundbreaking report detailing North Koreas horrendous record on human rights. The Commission found that North Koreas constituted a crime against humanity. What then has been this administrations policy to counter the North Korean threat? Our policy is something called ""strategic patience."" which started in 2009 under thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton. The main idea behind strategic patience. it seems. is to patiently wait until Kim Jong Un peacefully surrenders. The latest developments show that we are reaping the rewards of this illconceived policy. and it can no longer be allowed to remain in effect. The simple fact is that strategic patience has been a strategic failure. All that our socalled ""patience"" has done is to allow the North Korean regime to continue to test nuclear weapons. to expand its testing of intercontinental ballistic missiles. to grow its military power. and to develop cyber warfare technologies while systematically continuing to torture its own people. We have neither militarily deterred this regime nor effectively used our punitive tools. Our sanctions policy toward North Korea has been weak. This was noted in that same CSIS report: The sanctions against North Korea pale in comparison to the level of sanctioning against Iran .... The number of individuals and entities sanctioned by the U.S. and UN are 843 (U.S.) and 121 (UN) for Iran. but only 100 (U.S.) and 31 (UN) for North Korea. When we do impose sanctions against North Korea. they are often repetitive or ineffectual. Again. I quote from the Heritage Foundation report: In response to the North Korean cyberattack on Sony. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13687. which. though expansive in legal breadth. was only weakly implemented. The Administration targeted 13 North Korean entities. three organizations already on the U.S. sanctions list. and 10 individuals not involved in cyber warfare. That was our response to North Korea. To date. we have not imposed specific human rights sanctions on a single North Korean individual. There are 200.000 men. women. and children in political gulags in North Korea. and the United States has not imposed a specific human rights sanction on a single North Korean leader. It is a disgrace given the gravity of the abuses that have been perpetrated by this regime. These policy failures are why a year ago I began working on the legislation that is before us today that would reverse course and apply the pressure necessary to stop the forgotten maniac in Pyongyang. Last August. I had an opportunity to visit South Korea and meet with South Korean President Park. We talked about the situation on the peninsula. and we agreed that the status quo with North Korea is no longer sustainable. To witness the proximity of the threat for our South Korean allies. I visited the demilitarized zone. or the DMZ. Only days after I departed. North Korea fired artillery across the border. further illustrating the danger that South Koreans live under each and every day and the danger of armed escalation of this conflict. I also traveled to China and met with Foreign Minister Wang as well as highranking officials of the Peoples Liberation Army to discuss North Korea. From my conversations. however. it became evident that although they are growing exasperated with the North Korean regime. Beijing has done little with the intention of undertaking meaningful action to stop Kim Jong Un. Last October. I introduced S. 2144. the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act. I thank 17 of my colleagues in this Senate for cosponsoring this legislation. The substitute before us today represents a slightly modified version of S. 2144. In particular. this legislation mandates and not simply authorizes that the President impose sanctions against persons who materially contribute to North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile development and who import luxury goods into North Korea. mandatory sanctions against perpetrators who enable its censorship and human rights abuses. who engage in money laundering and manufacture of counterfeit goods and narcotics trafficking. who engage in activities undermining cyber security or have sold. supplied or transferred to or from North Korea precious metals or raw metals. including aluminum. steel. and coal for the benefit of North Koreas regime and its illicit activities. These sanctions are tough. and we know that a significant portion of the foreign currency that North Korea receives is for trade in its precious metals. raw materials. aluminum. steel. and coal. We know that about 90 percent of North Koreas economy is through its relationship with China. Senator CARDIN previously mentioned that nobody faces a greater threat than South Koreas neighbors Japan and China. which border a regime that is killing its own people and testing ballistic missiles in violation of Chinas determinations. the United States determinations. and certainly the United Nations determinations. I will note that the mandatory sanctions on North Koreas cyber activities and the mandatory sanctions on the minerals are unique to the Senate legislation. This bill also codifies the Executive orders that the President issued last year. 13687 and 13694. regarding cyber security as they applied to North Korea. which were enacted last year in the wake of the Sony Pictures hack and other cyber incidents. That is also a unique feature of the Senate bill. Lastly. if enacted and signed into law. the mandatory sanctions on cyber violators will break new ground for Congress. It is something that we can take as a model and apply to other nations that perpetrate against the United States. We need to look for every way to deprive Pyongyang of income to build it weapons programs. strengthen its cyber capabilities. and abuse its own people. We have to send a strong message to China. North Koreas diplomatic protector and largest trading partner. that the United States will use every economic tool at its disposal to stop Pyongyang. Finally. I would like to quote the Washington Post editorial board from this past Monday. February 8: President Obamas policy since 2009. ""strategic patience."" has failed. The policy has mostly consisted of ignoring North Korea while mildly cajoling China to pressure the regime. The editorial concludes: Both China and North Korea must see that they will pay a mounting price for what. to the United States. should be Mr. Kims intolerable steps toward a nuclear arsenal. ""Strategic patience"" is no longer a viable option. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post editorial be printed in the RECORD."
1140076872,Madam President. we have heard from a number of colleagues who have come to the floor in support of the legislation before us today. the North Korea sanctions legislation. Members of both sides of the aisle recognize the need to address the forgotten maniac in North Korea. We have also heard Members speak about a number of firsts that this legislation contemplatesthe first time that this would put in place mandatory cyber sanctions for cyber attacks. This is something that applies. yes. to North Korea today but in the future could apply to any nation that wishes to use its means to attack the United States or our businesses. So it is critically important. that piece of legislation that we are going to pass today that can have a lasting impact on the security of this country. We have also heard from a number of Members who have spoken about their concern with China. This legislation is not targeted at China. this legislation is targeted at North Korea. We have talked about how it is not targeted at the North Korean people but at the regime of Kim Jong Un. The legislation does everything we can to try to give the people of North Korea a better way of life. to try to find ways to communicate. to break down the silence they are faced with in this economic deprivation zone. to give them tools. perhaps radios and cell phone technology so they can find out what is happening beyond the confines of the torturous regime. But it does have an impact on those who try to get around the sanctions and the prohibited activities of the legislationin fact. some of the strongest language in the legislation. whether exporting to or from North Korea. whether exporting to or importing from North Korea goods. raw metals. precious materials that can be funneledthe money from that funneled to weapons of mass destruction and other activities prohibited by the legislation. So when North Korea is exporting gold or coaland we know that gold and coal are chiefly responsible for the North Korean foreign currency reservesthen that could be designated as a sanctioned entity under the legislation. Perhaps those entities are in China. The fact is. we need cooperation with China. We need cooperation with Japan and South Korea. We had that so strongly. and there is a possibility we wont. We have an opportunity for trilateral alliancethat is cooperation between the three nationsand that will allow us to work together. to share intelligence. to share the cooperative efforts and exercises when it comes to North Korea. and to work with China to help make sure that it is sticking by what it says it wants to do. which is to denuclearize the North Korean regime peacefully. I think it is key to our cooperation with China as we work on any number of issues. whether it is trade issues. whether it is issues dealing with the Internet. whether it is issues dealing with the South China Sea. Those are things that we continue to work with China on and are working to resolve. but we also have to make sure part of that conversation is North Korea. China controls a tremendous number of levers and power in North Korea. Ninety percent of their economic activities in North Korea can find their way to some way of subsistence with China. to create a reliance on China. an economic reliance that they have right now. So this legislation will target those who are doing too much to empower the Kim Jong Un regime and to give them the money they have used to develop missiles and to develop weapons of mass destruction. Just to give an example of some of the commodity trade that we have seen. trade commodity sanctions in this bill would address the issue of rare earth minerals and coal and steel and other goods that are exported to other countries to earn foreign currencies for the North Korea regime. To give people an idea of how much money that is. expert estimates put rare earth minerals and steel exports at around $1.8 billion and $245 million respectively. That is a lot of money that the regime is currently getting from outside in trading these goods. But if that $1.8 billion and that $245 million goes back to build weapons of mass destruction. this act will begin sanctions. The President is required to. unless the issue is a very narrow. casebycase national security issue. There is a mandatory investigation into those activities. So I think this is a strong step that is receiving tremendous bipartisan support. With that. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1140076893,Madam President. I want to thank all of my colleagues for their thoughtful input during this debate. We have had great discussions from numerous Members who have come to the floor throughout the day to discuss North Korea and the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act. I want to thank Senator CORKER for his leadership on the committee. the product of which is a very good bipartisan sanctions action. I hope and agree with Senator MENENDEZ. our colleague from New Jersey. that this will indeed receive unanimous support. I wish to thank Senator MENENDEZ through the Chair for his efforts to make this a success. and thanks to the ranking member of the committee and ranking member of the Asia subcommittee. as well. for their work. We set out a year ago to work on this problem and address this challenge. The purpose of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act is very simple. The purpose of the bill is to peacefully disarm North Korea through mandatory sanctions that would deprive the regime of the means to build its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. to deprive the regime of its means to carry out malicious cyber activities. and to deprive the regime of the means to continue its gross abuse of the human rights of its own people. That is the purpose of this bill. Obviously. there is more work to do. The discussions today talk about the work we have to do with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. in the other Chamber. and the work we have to do around the globe to make sure that the United Nations Security Council recognizes this challenge and that China understands our basis of cooperation depends on actions against something we both agree on. and that is that we shouldnt have a nuclear North Korea. Lets build that relationship of cooperation with China. Lets build that relationship of trilateral alliance among South Korea. Japan. and the United States. Those are the things we can begin to accomplish with this legislation. I had a conversation with Admiral Gortney not too long ago about North Korea. He is the head of NORTHCOM. headquartered in Colorado Springs. CO. It was a conversation about North Korea and what he sees. Through his comments. you can tell he is concerned. and he believes the situation in the Korean Peninsula is at its most unstable point since the armistice. Over six decades. we today are seeing the most unstable point on the Korean Peninsula because of a rogue regime that tortures its own people. kills its own leaders. and deprives its citizens of human dignity. Strategic patience has failed. One expert said we have moved from strategic patience to benign neglect. That is not leadership. So today we start a new policy based on strength and not patience. This legislation would mandatenot simply authorize but mandatethe imposition of sanctions against all persons who materially contribute to North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile development. import luxury goods into North Korea. enable its censorship and human rights abuses. engage in money laundering and manufacture of counterfeit goods and narcotic trafficking. engage in activities undermining cyber security. have sold. supplied or transferred to or from North Korea precious metals or raw metals. including aluminum. steel. and coal for the benefit of North Koreas regime and its illicit activities. that is. $1.8 billion in raw metals. $245 million in other goods that are sanctioned under this act. including those entities that decide they would import from North Korea if that money they would generate from the sale of that import goes to the development of proliferation activities. The cyber sanctions and strategy that we require are unique to the Senate bill. They will be the first mandatory sanctions in history passed against cyber criminals. This bill also codifies Executive orders 13687 and 13694 regarding cyber security. as they apply to North Korea. which were enacted last year in the wake of the Sony Pictures hack and other cyber incidents. It is also a unique feature of our Senate bill today. The mandatory sanctions on metals and minerals are unique to the legislation. Expert estimates. as we just said. put North Koreas rare metal minerals and steel exports at around $2 billion. so these sanctions could have a significant impact in deterring the regime and its enablers. The sanctions in this bill are secondary. as we have discussed. which means they would be applied to individuals and entities. not just in the United States but around the world. who would assist the Government of North Korea and the designated entities that engage in the activities prohibited by this legislation. It mandates a strategy and sanctions against North Koreas human rights abuses. You can see what it does on the chart. You can see the opportunity we have before us and the American people and our obligation to make sure we are doing everything we can to stand up for the people of North Korea and stand up to the totalitarian regime of North Korea. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation tonight. this bipartisan product of countless hours of debate and discussions and negotiations. and to come away with a good product that we can be proud of. to work with the House Members so that this is on the Presidents desk. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I yield my time.

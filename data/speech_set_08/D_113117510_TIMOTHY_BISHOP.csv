1130023648,"Mr. Speaker. I rise to recognize the passing of Almerindo ""Al"" Carvalheira. a Vietnam veteran who lived an extraordinary life of service to his country and to his fellow veterans. Al succumbed to cancer on January 21. 2013. at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northport. New York. Al was born on October 21. 1947. in Portugal. His family immigrated to the United States when he was 10 years old and settled in Nesconset. New York. Al proudly served his country in the United States Army during the Vietnam War and received numerous awards and decorations. including two Purple Hearts. the Bronze Star Medal. and the Air Medal. Honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant in December of 1969. Al returned to his home on Long Island where he pursued a career in nursing and was hired by the Northport VA Medical Center in 1977. There he dedicated himself to the care and treatment of his fellow veterans as a VA registered nurse and nurse leader for nearly four decades. Al was known as a highly effective and empathetic caregiver who was never too busy to spend time with his patients. especially the most challenging among them. His own experience gave him a unique understanding of what his patients had endured in combat. In discussions with them. he often cited his favorite book. ""The Things They Carried."" written by fellow Vietnam veteran Tim OBrien. Soon after the start of his career at the VA medical center. Al was promoted to nurse manager. which gave him the supervision of all inpatient psychiatric units and the outpatient treatment program. In addition to these significant responsibilities. Al trained and developed staff in crisis intervention and implemented a crisis response team for the safety of VA patients and staff. In order to provide veterans the best care possible. Al found the time to earn a masters degree in nursing from Stony Brook University. Dear to Als heart was the Suffolk County. New York. chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America. to which he devoted 38 years of service. working day in and day out taking care of ""his boys."" advocating for the needs of all veterans and raising awareness of the contributions and sacrifices made by our Nations veterans and their families. In May of 2009. I had the great pleasure of working with Al and his friends and fellow Vietnam veterans Richie Kitson and Clarence Simpson to rename the Riverhead. New York. Post Office in honor of Suffolk Countys only Vietnam War Congressional Medal of Honor recipient. PFC Garfield M. Langhorn. That same year. Al took the lead in the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Garden on the grounds of the Northport VA Medical Center. which recognizes and honors the sacrifices of our Nations servicemen and -women. The memorial gardens dedication ceremony was held in October 2010 and was attended by more than 300 people. In 2011. Al and members of the VVA were inspired by Dignity Memorials replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall to expand the Northport VA Medical Centers Vietnam Veterans Memorial Garden for the inclusion of a permanent war memorial known as The Wall of Wars. It was during this time that Al was diagnosed with cancer. Although Al will not be present at the VAs Veterans Day dedication of the The Wall of Wars. his legacy as a war hero. a VA nurse. and a veterans advocate is and will be forever present on the grounds of the Northport VA Medical Center and throughout Suffolk Countys veteran community. On January 25. 2013. Vietnam veteran and U.S. Army Sergeant Al Carvalheira was laid to rest with military honors at Long Islands Calverton National Cemetery. Al is survived by his beloved wife of 40 years. Geraldine. and their two sons. Almerindo and John. as well as six grandchildren. Mr. Speaker. on behalf of New Yorks First Congressional District and a grateful Nation. it is my honor and privilege to recognize Almerindo ""Al"" Carvalheira for his distinguished service and many contributions to our Nation and his fellow veterans. He will always be remembered with our love and appreciation."
1130057313,Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013. This critical. bipartisan legislation allows Congress to renew its commitment to our Nations water infrastructure for the first time since 2007. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman SHUSTER and Chairman GIBBS for the open and inclusive process with which the committee drafted WRRDA. I would also like to express my gratitude to the chairman and to Ranking Member RAHALL for their leadership in returning the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to its longstanding traditions of bipartisanship and collaboration. H.R. 3080 is not a perfect bill. It is not the bill that either side of the aisle would have drafted on its own. However. it represents a bipartisan effort based on valuable input from Members and stakeholders. constructive negotiation. and mutual respect. This ought to serve as a model for how this Congress conducts the American peoples business. This bill is about many things. but most importantly. it is about job creation. not just good construction jobs that will come with the authorization of Chiefs Reports contained in the bill. but also the jobs that rely on a robust network of large and small ports and inland waterways to move goods throughout the United States. H.R. 3080 also provides some relief from the challenges facing the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund by setting targets so that a greater amount of fund proceeds are used for their intended purposesharbor maintenance. The bill also provides for the maintenance of our Nations small ports. However. we Members must be vigilant that the changes proposed in this bill do not further erode the ability of the Corps to carry out construction projects. such as those necessary to meet the postPanamax vessels that will come once the Panama Canal expansion is complete. Mr. Chairman. I am pleased at the progress we have made together on improving water infrastructure in the United States. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
1130075754,I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition on the motion to move the previous question so that this body may consider H.R. 1010. the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013. This crucial piece of legislation will positively impact the lives of nearly 30 million American workers and their families by gradually raising the Federal minimum wage from its current $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour by 2016. Beyond 2016. the bill ties the Federal minimum wage to annual inflation. ensuring that hardworking men and women will never again see their wages stagnate due to congressional obstruction or inaction. Lets first discuss who benefits from this legislation. I am sure that many watching at home and some in this very room may have a skewed perception of the contemporary minimum wage worker. I will try my best to clear up a few of these fallacies so that this debate can be framed by fact and not by stereotype. The average age of the minimum wage worker is 35 years old: 54 percent of them are fulltime workers. and 55 percent of them are women. The average affected worker earns half of his or her familys total income. and more than onefourth of the minimum wage workers have children. Of the Nations. roughly. 75 million children. nearly onefifth of them have at least one parent who would receive a raise if the minimum wage were increased to $10.10 an hour. An employee working 40 hours per week for the entire 52week calendarno time offat the Federal minimum wage will earn just $15.080 in Now. who can live on $15.000 a year? I just heard the gentleman from Georgia speak passionately about his concern for the American worker. I would ask that gentleman and others who are concerned about the American worker: Are you concerned about all of the American workers. or are you just concerned with those who earn at higher brackets than $15.080 a year? A worker who works full time and is still below the Federal poverty level will qualify for Medicaid. for CHIP. for SNAP. and for other public assistance programs that will cost taxpayers approximately $7 billion this year alone. Lets raise the minimum wage. and lets lift people out of poverty without spending a dime of additional Federal money. Lets save on those programs that the Federal Government has put in place to help those maintain a standard of living who need a helping hand. A recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University found that 71 percent of American workers support raising the minimum wage. That same poll found that Democrats. Republicans and Independents are all in agreement that raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do.
1130092638,Mr. Speaker. I thank my ranking member for his very kind words. and I rise today in strong support of the conference report for H.R. 3080. the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. Today is a monumental occasion for our Nations economy. for the creation of goodpaying jobs. and for the health of our natural environment. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member RAHALL. we present this Chamber with a thoughtful. reasonable bill that renews this Congress commitment to our Nations waterrelated infrastructure. In that light. I would like to personally thank our chairman. our ranking member. and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources. Mr. GIBBS. for the open and inclusive process with which our committee conducted negotiations with the other body on WRRDA and for their leadership in returning our committee to its longstanding traditions of bipartisanship and collaboration. Today is also a monumental day because. while this bill is about many things. most importantly. it is about job creation. not only those good construction jobs that will come with the authorization of 34 Chiefs Reports contained in the bill. but also the jobs that rely on a robust network of large and small ports and inland waterways to move goods throughout the United States. I am especially pleased that this conference report provides a reasonable path forward to the challenges facing the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. This legislation provides that. within 10 years. 100 percent of the fund proceeds are used for their intended purposesharbor maintenancewhile ensuring that any increase in harbor maintenance does not come at the expense of other critical corps programs. I am also thankful that this conference report recognizes the critical importance of our Nations small ports to our regional and local economies in establishing future funding priorities. Finally. Mr. Speaker. today is a monumental day because. at long last. this WRRDA restores the Federal commitment to our other remaining water infrastructure challengesour failing sewage and drinking water infrastructure. This conference report includes legislation that has eluded this Congress for almost three decades. the reauthorization of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. For decades. this critical and widely popular program has been the leading source of Federal funding to States and communities to address their ongoing water quality challenges. I am pleased that much of this language is modeled after legislation that I have introduced over the last few Congresses. and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their willingness to include this language in the conference report. I am pleased at the process we have made together on improving water infrastructure in the United States. Again. I want to thank the leadership of our chairman and our ranking member for getting us to this point today. and I also want to thank the staff on both the majority and minority side who worked tirelessly and cooperatively to bring us to this point. I urge support of the conference report.
1130114954,Mr. Chairman. I thank my friend and our ranking member from West Virginia for yielding and for his leadership on the T&I Committee. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5078. Last session. the Republican majority pushed through a rider to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill to block this administration from using Agency guidance to clarify how they would interpret two confusing decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court that called into question the protections of the Clean Water Act over our Nations waters. At that time. the Republican majority claimed that this use of administration guidance was unprecedented and in violation of the law. notwithstanding the fact that the previous administration followed the exact same process in issuing two guidance documents which. coincidentally. remain in force today. In fact. it is these two Bushera guidance documents that have compounded the confusion. uncertainty. and increased compliance costs faced by our constituents today. But dont take my word on this. Let me quote from some of the comments made in opposition to the Bushera guidance. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation and others: With no clear regulatory definitions to guide their determinations. what has emerged is a hodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional theories. Again. according to the American Farm Bureau Federation and others: The Bush administration guidance is causing confusion and added delays in an already burdened and strained permit decisionmaking process. which ultimately will result. and is resulting. in increased delays and costs to the public at large. Finally. according to the Waters Advocacy Coalition: Until a comprehensive set of rules regarding which water bodies the agencies will regulate is promulgated. the public and Agency field staff will be beleaguered by partial answers. confusing standards. and ad hoc. overbroad. and arbitrary decisions pertaining to the scope of Federal jurisdiction. In April of 2011. over 150 Members of this House wrote to the Environmental Protection Agency and to the Corps requesting that a proposed guidance document of the Obama administration be reconsidered. In that letter. these Members suggested: If the administration seeks to make regulatory changes to the Clean Water Act. a noticeand- comment rulemaking is required. In the intervening months. this is exactly what the administration has done. In 2012. the administration chose to withdraw the proposed 2011 guidance document and instead pursued a noticeandcomment rulemaking to address much of the confusion. uncertainty. and increased costs surrounding the scope of the Clean Water Act protections. However. many of these same Members who asked for a formal rulemaking are now vehemently opposed to this rulemaking going forward. I have to ask why? Are these Members opposed to providing greater clarity on the scope of Federal Clean Water Act protections? Are they opposed to trying to reduce the confusion and uncertainty facing our regulated communities while at the same time trying to ensure that our network of waters and wetlands are protected from pollution or destruction? Opponents of this rulemaking are trying to portray this as a Federal attempt to regulate birdbaths. puddles. and driveways. but both common sense and the testimony of representatives of the EPA and the Corps before our committee would confirm that these were never subject to Clean Water Act jurisdiction. nor would they be subject to the act under the administrations proposed rule. In short. this is not a debate about the Federal Government trying to regulate someones backyard birdbath. but it is about ensuring that those waters and wetlands that provide hundreds of millions of Americans with their drinking water. provide vital protection to our towns and communities. and provide valuable habitat to our native fish and wildlife are protected. Mr. Chairman. to be fair. several of my own constituents have expressed concern with the substance of the proposed rule. I have listened to their concerns. and I have pressed the Agency witnesses who have appeared before our subcommittee on several critical areas. I have questioned the agencies to ensure that the scope of the proposed rule lives solely within the confines of the two Supreme Court decisions on this matter. otherwise. such changes would require an act of Congress.
1130115013,"Mr. Chairman. my amendment gets to the heart of the debate on this proposed rule. For months. opponents of the proposed rule have made numerous claims about its impacts. Yet. despite numerous efforts by representatives of the administrations to answer these claims and to point out how many of these claims are simply false. we seem to go around and around. again and again. on these allegations. My amendment simply addresses these concerns and claims. saying that. if any of them prove to be true. then the Secretary and the Administrator are prohibited from issuing any final rule that would bring about these occurrences. For example. opponents of the proposed rule have claimed that this rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act authority. When asked this direct question during our subcommittee hearing. the administrations witness stated clearly that the proposed rule ""would not assert jurisdiction over any type of waters not previously protected over the past 40 years."" Under my amendment. if the administration is proven incorrect. the final rule could not be implemented. Similarly. opponents have suggested that the rule is inconsistent with the rulings and jurisdictional tests outlined by the Supreme Court. The administrations witness has testified that this rule is consistent with the tests outlined by the U.S. Supreme Court. If my amendment is adopted and if the administration is wrong about this assertion. then the final rule could not be implemented. Opponents of the proposed rule have claimed that the proposed rule increases the regulation of ditches. The administration has testified that. in fact. it would reduce the scope of jurisdictional ditches that are covered by the Bush administration guidance. If my amendment is adopted and if the administration is incorrect in this assertion. the rule cannot be implemented. Opponents contend that. under this rule. individuals would be required to have Federal Clean Water Act permits for draining farm ponds or for activities in the water on your driveways or your birdbaths or puddles in your backyard. The administration has asserted. obviously. that these types of waters have never been subject to the Clean Water Act. nor would they be under this rulemaking. If somehow the administration is wrong about this. under my amendment. the final rule could not be implemented. Lastly. opponents contend that the rule would eliminate existing statutory and regulatory exemptions for agriculture or increase the regulation of groundwater or require Federal Clean Water Act permits for landuse activities. Yet the administration has time and time again testified that these assertions are simply inaccurate. Again. if my amendment is adopted and if the administration is incorrect. the final rule cannot go forward. In my view. this administration has put forward a good faith effort to provide additional clarity on the scope of Clean Water Act protections for our Nations waters that are consistent with current scientific information as well as the precedent of the Supreme Court. While it is not perfect. this rule is far better than the current regulatory process that has led to numerous delays. significant increases in compliance costs. and greater difficulty in protecting our Nations water resources. I urge the adoption of my amendment. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130117591,Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. I rise in support of the McKeon amendment to grant the President the authority needed to fund and train Syrian opposition forces and counter the threat posed by ISIS. Since the September 11 attacks. our Nation has taken the fight to terrorists. Our brave men and women in uniform supported by the defense and intelligence agencies have kept us safe from another attack on American soil. Now. our allies on the ground in the Middle East must take the fight to ISIS. supported by our air power. arms. and expertise. I agree with the administration that the most effective way for the United States to realize this goal is providing training and equipment to our allies in Iraq and select groups among the Syrian opposition. This is not a situation that can be solved by the introduction of U.S. troops into combat. In fact. such a response would jeopardize the gains made recently following the air campaign over Iraq. It is vital. however. that the Syrian opposition groups selected to receive support be fully vetted by the administration to ensure to the greatest extent possible that no weapons or expertise will end up in the hands of our enemies. whether they be the Islamic State or another bad actor involved in the conflict. We must only provide support to those groups that both the Department of Defense and State have determined to have the greatest chance of success. While there are no guarantees in this situation. the administration must take appropriate steps to minimize the risk and avoid repeating history. It must also be made clear that these efforts are not the first step of an everescalating conflict ending with widespread U.S. involvement in a combat role. Our allies in the Arab world. both Sunni and Shia. must be the leaders of the international alliance to combat ISIS. Only through a coalition and widespread involvement of Arab nations will these efforts succeed and not be seen as yet another chapter of Sunni on Shia violence or another chapter in a war between the Christian West and the Muslim Middle East. Our allies must make significant military commitments to support moderate groups in opposition to ISIS. Finally. the administration must be able to give a clear view of their longterm strategy and goals going forward. Entering a conflict without clear objectives and an exit strategy is not a situation that any Member of the House wishes to repeat. I urge my colleagues to support the McKeon amendment.
1130118973,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5266 to reauthorize appropriations for the National Estuary Program. First. Mr. Speaker. I would like to recognize my committee colleagues. the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Washington . for introducing this legislation. Our Nations coasts and oceans provide a wealth of resources for the entire country. and among these areas. nowhere is more valuable than estuaries. Estuaries are bodies of water that receive both water from rivers and saltwater from the sea. This mix makes a unique environment that is extremely productive in terms of its ecosystem values. Government studies have found that estuaries provide habitat for 75 percent of the U.S. commercial and 80 to 90 percent of the recreational fishing catches. Perhaps the central problem in the protection and restoration of estuaries is that they ultimately lie downstream. Everything that enters the smallest stream. tributary. or headwater in a watershed eventually runs into a single outlet. impacting in some way all the biological elements of that ecosystem and all of the commerce that revolves around the estuary. The First Congressional District of New York. which I have had the honor to represent. abuts two priority estuaries with the Environmental Protection Agencys National Estuary Program. the Peconic Bay and the Long Island Sound. These unique waters are precious to the residents of Long Island. and their continued health and vitality provide multiple benefits to the residents of Long Island and to the economic and environmental health of the region. I am pleased that this legislation demonstrates the willingness of this Congress to move legislation that protects our waterrelated environment. The Federal seed money that comes from the EPAs National Estuary Program. when combined with other State and local resources. helps to implement locallydriven solutions to local water quality challenges. In my view. if there are limits in the success of these programs. they are closely related to the availability of adequate restoration funds. In the 111th Congress. I was the lead sponsor of another bill. H.R. 4715. the Clean Estuaries Act of 2010. that would have also authorized the National Estuary Program. however. at higher levels than contained in the current bill. That legislation passed the House on a bipartisan basis and by an overwhelming margin. however. the Senate failed to ever act on that bill. While H.R. 5266 does represent a significant reduction in the authorization of appropriations for this important program. I commend the bipartisan sponsors of this legislation for ensuring that the new authorization shows some room to increase the funding of these locallydriven restoration efforts. rather than simply cutting those efforts. Too often these days. we seem driven to cut Federal spending for programs that provide real benefit to our Nation without an awareness of the consequences of these actions. I can only hope that in the years to come this Chamber will recognize that there are places where the Federal Government can help and should be making increased investments. such as to repair our crumbling infrastructure or to protect our fragile natural environment. These are only some of the ongoing challenges that face this Nation. and we need a Congress that is serious about taking on the hard questions and about making the right investments. not only for our lives and livelihoods. but for those generations of Americans to come. Mr. Speaker. again. I support the passage of H.R. 5266. and I urge my colleagues to also support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130124833,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I wish my Republican colleagues were not rushing to consider this bill without more deliberation. The other body just passed this bill last week. We have had no hearings on the bill. no committee meetings. no markups. I understand that several general aviation groups have expressed concerns about the bill. and I would have liked the opportunity to hear from them and study their specific reservations. Each of the Nations federallyassisted airports is part of a systema national systemthat is greater than the sum of its parts. The Federal Government invests $3.35 billion a year in airport improvements because each airport in the system not only drives economic growth. but also is a safe harbor for a pilot in distress. For those reasons. the general rule is that we invest in airports. not close them. nevertheless. I understand that the airport in St. Clair. Missouri. which this bill would allow to close. presents some unique circumstances. Although the Federal Government has invested almost $1.1 million in the airport since 1963. the airport has not received a Federal grant since 2006 when it received $300.000. There are now only about eight aircraft movements at the airport a day. Community leaders believe that there are simply higher and better uses for the airport land. Based on these extraordinary circumstances. this bill would allow the city of St. Clair to close the airport and would release the city from its obligations as a recipient of Federal airport improvement funds. provided the city transfers remaining grant funds and the market value of the land to the Missouri Department of Transportation. While I have serious reservations about the precedent that this bill could set. I recognize the unique situation in this particular case. Going forward. I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about what it means for our national system of airports when we start permitting airports to shut down without working through the Federal Aviation Administrations administrative process. I reserve the balance of my time.

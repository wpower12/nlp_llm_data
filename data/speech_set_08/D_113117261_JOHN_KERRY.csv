1130002554,Mr. President. I want to begin by thanking my colleaguesall of themfor their unbelievably generous comments to me personally. in the committee. on the floor. and in the halls and at meetings over the course of the last weeks. I will always be grateful for our friendships. I thank my wife Teresa. who is here with us. and my entire family for their unbelievable support through this journey. Five times Massachusetts has voted to send me to the U.S. Senate. Yesterday. nearly three decades after the people of Massachusetts first voted me into this office. the people with whom I work in the Senate voted me out of it. As always. I accept the Senates sound judgment. Eight years ago. I admit that I had a slightly different plan to leave the Senate. but 61 million Americans voted that they wanted me to stay here with you. So staying here I learned about humility. and I learned that sometimes the greatest lesson in life comes not from victory but from dusting oneself off after defeat and starting over when you get knocked down. I was reminded throughout this journey of something that is often said but not always fully appreciated: All of us Senators are only as good as our staffa staff that gives up their late nights and weekends. postpones vacations. doesnt get home in time to tuck children into bed. and all of those lost moments because they are here helping us serve. They are not elected. They didnt get into public service to get rich. That is for sure. And their names are rarely in the newspapers. But from the staff in the mailrooms to the people who answer the front phones to the policy experts and the managers. the legislative correspondents who write the letters. the caseworkers who make government accountable. and the people everywhere in between. they make the Senate work for people. I have been blessed to have a spectacular staff. And while I know every one of my colleagues would say the same thing about their staff. it is true about mine. If I start naming names. I am going to miss somebody. so I am not going to. But I think every one of my staff will understand why I want to acknowledge five who are not with us any longer. They are up in heaven looking down on all of us. and Ted Kennedy has probably drafted all of them. Jayona Beal. Jeanette Boone. Bill Bradley. Louise Etheridge. and Gene Hellerthe latter two of whom were senior citizen volunteers in my Boston office who opened our mail for over a decade. They were not paid. They just did this out of love of country. We miss them all. and we thank them for their selfless contribution. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at this point a list of names of the people who have helped me serve this Nation.

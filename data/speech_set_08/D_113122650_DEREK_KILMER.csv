1130004548,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today with sincere appreciation for the opportunity I have to represent my region in our Nations Capital. Throughout the past year. whether it was in Grays Harbor or Port Angeles. Bremerton. or Tacoma. what I heard from folks around my region is they want solutions to our problems. People want to get back to work. They want to start new businesses. They want to explore new frontiers of science and technology. They want to help build our Nations bridges and roads. They want to refurbish our schools and buildings. Im passionate about these issues. and Im committed to working with my colleagues from both sides of the aisles to find new ways to move this economy forward. Over the past 6 weeks. Ive had the opportunity to meet with constituents to talk about their top concerns. And whether its back in Washington State. or visits with folks whove traveled 3.000 miles to our Nations capital. the number one thing that I hear about is the reckless and devastating impact that impending acrosstheboard cuts would have on our families and on our communities. Ive heard from educators and administrators that they face dramatic cuts that would lead to ballooning class sizes and significant cuts to financial aid. Ive heard from parents who are afraid for their kids who have autism. fearful that their kids wont be able to get the services that they rely on. Ive heard from tribal leaders who say that these cuts will scale back community policing on our reservations and jeopardize patient access to the Indian Health Service. And as someone who has spent the last decade working in economic development. Ive heard from small business owners who say that all of this uncertainty is making them hesitant to hire new workers and expand their production lines. Virtually every meeting that I have had has detailed how reckless and wrongheaded these acrosstheboard cuts would be. Yesterday. testifying before the House Armed Services Committee. Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter pointed out that these cuts arent happening because weve thought about them strategically. Theyre not happening because weve identified wasteful spending. Theyre not happening because weve discovered some new technology that makes it cheaper to keep our Nation safe. Theyre only happening because they are. as he put it. ""the collateral damage of political gridlock."" Weve already seen the effects of these looming cuts in Washington State. The Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. the largest employer in my district. had to postpone its career fair because of all of this budget uncertainty. This is a no brainerwe have the work and we have the workers. but they cant hire because Congress hasnt done its job. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard needs to be able to actively recruit and hire workers. Our local economy needs it. and our national security depends on it. And yet. here we are. Later today. we will be focusing on legislation that doesnt solve this problem. isnt going to pass the Senate. and isnt going to become law. And after we finish legislative business tomorrow. were all being sent home for a week. This leaves us with just 4 legislative days for us to act before these acrosstheboard cuts go into effect. We were elected to this body to help people. Stopping these damaging. nonstrategic. acrosstheboard cuts to avoid undermining our economy should be our top priority. We should be working day and night until we have a solution. By doing nothing. we risk putting our fragile economy back into a recession. By doing nothing. we refuse the commitments weve made. Were cutting education. kicking kids off Head Start. hurting small businesses. and gutting research and innovationthe foundations of our longterm economic growth. By doing nothing. we hurt the men and women who spend their days protecting our Nation and providing essential services to the American people. And by doing nothing. Congress is spending the wrong message to the American people. Mr. Speaker. we need to get America back to work. And. Mr. Speaker. we need to get Congress working again. too. Doing nothing is not an option. Lets put an end to these gimmicks. and lets stop kicking the can down the road. Lets stop these series of selfimposed crises that fissure the trust and predictability that the private sector needs. Lets work together to reach a balanced compromise to replace the acrosstheboard cuts with a smart. balanced approach to addressing our fiscal challenges and getting our economy growing again. Lets maintain our commitment to our Nations most vulnerable and preserve retirement security for our seniors. And lets get America back to work. PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT with section 5 of the Voting Rights TO VOTE Act."
1130014921,Thank you. And thank you to all of my colleagues from Washington State who spoke before me. Im batting cleanup and have the unique position of having neither served with Booth Gardner nor having run against him. But I actually met him when I was a kid. Theres no doubt that Booth Gardners legacy of accomplishments is impressive. and I could stand here and list them off. both from his role as Governor and for his involvement on trade issues at the Federal level. But I think it says more about the kind of man Booth Gardner was when we dont just talk about what he accomplished. but we talk about what kind of man he was. As someone who met him as a kid. I was just very much struck by the fact that he was exceedingly civil and very. very kind and seemed to have interest in every person he represented. Regardless of ones race or religion or orientation or gender or economic status. he seemed to care about every person he represented. including a little kid in Port Angeles. Washington. where I was born and raised. I met Booth for the first time when I was a kid and he was a candidate and my mom was involved on his campaign. I was struck by the fact that he seemed to be spending an inordinate amount of time talking to me. even though I wasnt old enough to vote. I met him again in his last year in office. As a high school senior. I received a scholarship to go off to college. and Booth. as Governor of our State at the time. was hosting a luncheon to honor all the scholarship recipients. And I remember he came over to talk to my mom and me and say hello. In that very brief interaction. I was just struck by the extent to which he seemed to care about my mom and about how much he cared about me. As an 18yearold. I just thought it was really cool that a Governor expressed that level of interest. Over the years. Id run into him at political events or often at educationoriented events or events in Pierce County. where he was our first county executive. And our interactions always started in the exact same way. Hed start by saying. Hows your mom? Many years later. just this last year when I decided to run for Congress. I was very touched that he came to my kickoff in Tacoma. Parkinsons. by that point. meant that he could not walk. and he struggled very deeply to express himself. I went over to thank him for coming. I kneeled down and thanked him. and I could tell he was struggling to say something. It struck me I knew he was going to ask. Hows your mom? I thanked him for that. and I told him she was doing just fine. The other thing Ill say about Booth and his legacy is the legacy he lives behind of his family. His grandson. Jack. actually interned with our campaign. Hes an extraordinary young man who spoke very eloquently at the memorial service that was held in honor of Governor Gardner. So you can look at his legacy of accomplishments when it comes to education or protecting our environment or extending health care services to folks who need it or his work to improve our economy or improve civil rights. or you can look at his extraordinary business legacy as someone who is a leader in our business community. But for me. his legacy is as a guy who truly cared about others. Thats how I will remember Booth Gardner. Today. I will tell all who are listening that my mom is doing well. but she misses Booth Gardner. I miss Booth Gardner. and the people of Washington State miss Booth Gardner.
1130030817,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to discuss the damage from Congress inability to do its job and pass a budget. and the unreasonable lengths that folks have to go to cover for the reckless policy of sequestration. As I said the very first time I spoke in this Chamber. Congress should be doing all it can to replace the acrosstheboard cuts caused by sequestration with a balanced. bipartisan. longterm budget. Cutting across the board is not a strategy. In fact. its antistrategic. Unfortunately. this Congress has been stuck in ""park"" when it comes to working toward a longterm budget. In fact. Congress has only passed 13 bills in 6 months. none of them dealing with jobs. and none of them working to replace these nonstrategic cuts. Congress needs to understand the impacts of its dysfunction. In my district. we see those consequences every day. Im a member of the House Armed Services Committee. and Im proud to represent several military installations. including Naval Base Kitsap and Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. and I represent many men and women who work at Joint Base LewisMcChord. The Navy. in fact. is the largest employer in my district. Im frequently copied on emails from civilian Navy workers who are resigning because of the disarray caused by Congress. the threat of furloughs. and the loss of costofliving adjustments. Workers often choose those jobs. despite lower salaries. because they love their country and they want to protect it. Also. government offers stability that the private industry often cant. But these workers no longer feel valued. and thanks to Congress. working at the shipyard doesnt even offer stability anymore. Its affecting the morale of our workers and the ability of our shipyard to execute its mission. Heres a direct quote from a manager who contacted me. He wrote: We will have problems retaining professionals if this fiscal environment continues. We will have trouble accomplishing our current workload. let alone providing any level of increased engineering support. Mr. Speaker. this will only cost us more in the long run. This dysfunction in Congress is directly responsible for good workers walking away and is threatening the mission of the United States Navy. It also affects the local contractors and small businesses in my district that support these missions. Theyre already facing sweeping layoffs and tremendous uncertainty. Heres another example: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. in my district. while mostly spared from furloughs under sequestration. still is limited in its ability to fill jobs made vacant by attrition. The hiring freeze went into effect right as they were planning on adding 600 workers. The shipyard has the work. Our region needs the jobs. Theyve only recently announced that they can slowly hire to cover for some attrition. Because of these constraints. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard has resorted to asking anyoneupper level staff. anybody who has carried a tool bag or used a wrenchto help deliver three submarines and an aircraft carrier back to the fleet. Thats a testament to the lengths people are going to to cover for such an insane policy like sequestration. We have seen the same thing at Joint Base LewisMcChord. where 10.000 civilian employees have received notice of furloughs. We have seen it affect military training where weve seen rotations to the National Training Center cancelled. General Brown at Joint Base LewisMcChord told our paper: Its a huge impact on training. Where is the fine line where you go from being the best in the world to second best? Its not right that Congress doesnt have their backs on this. We have got to stop this policy. From my perspective and from the perspective of the folks who have to deal with this damaging policy every day. it doesnt matter whos to blame for the idea of sequestration. All that matters is that both parties work together to stop it. Every day that this Congress doesnt work on coming together on a balanced. longterm budget is another day that folks around the country have to cover for Congress dysfunction. Democrats and Republicans need to work together on this. This doesnt make sense for the folks in my district who face losing up to 20 percent of their pay or for the folks in my district who cant apply for an open job because of our budget uncertainty. It doesnt make sense for the kids in Head Start programs who are hurt by sequestration. We should stop these acrosstheboard cuts for them. too. The right solution is for Congress to replace these cuts altogether with a balanced. longterm budget. I am ready to work with both parties to get this done for our national security. for our economy. and for the American people who deserve better."
1130039916,Madam Chair. I thank the ranking member for yielding. Within this en bloc includes an amendment that highlights a very troubling breakdown within the Department of Defense. how they collect and process their personnel data. Our brave men and women who are deployed overseas rely on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to give them assurance that they wont need to worry about a foreclosure on their house. a lease being terminated. or outstanding credit card debt. We ask significant sacrifices from our troops. and this is a needed helping hand at a time when they are rightfully focused on serving their Nation. In order to provide these protections. financial institutions are required by law to consult the Department of Defenses data system to validate servicemembers deployment. This system is called the Defense Manpower Data Center. or DMDC. Ive heard from a number of stakeholders that the DMDC is riddled with inaccuracies because each service feeds their own data into the database. with no standardization between services. and much of it was originally entered by hand. with littletono quality assurance. Obviously this creates a significant problem. We need our financial institutions to have accurate data so that troops can get the benefits provided by law. Im extremely concerned about the reliability of this data for the purposes of SCRA compliance and. for that matter. any other personnel process affected by the DOD. Going forward. I hope we can work together to address this serious data problem within the DOD. My amendment would cut $1 million to the Defense Human Resources Activity Operation and Maintenance. DefenseWide account. and reinsert that funding into the exact same place. with the intent of encouraging a study on how the Defense Human Resources Activity components and the CIO identify. catalog. process. communicate and rectify mistakes or inconsistencies found when data is uploaded to the DMDC. I want to thank Chairman YOUNG and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for working with me on this issue. and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
1130052762,"Madam Speaker. I would like to thank the good gentleman from California for organizing this time. Far and away the most common thing said to me over the last year has been: Dear God. why on Earth would you want to be in Congress. particularly when you have two little kids and Congress is such a mess? I will tell you. at every occasion I have responded the same way: It is because I got two little kids and Congress is a mess. I actually care about what kind of country they grow up in. I think if people who think that this is okay and sit on the sidelines. we are never going to fix it. I will tell you. it is strange to join an organization that. according to recent polling information. is held in lower regard than head lice. Having only been here for about 9 months. I have a pretty good sense of why. When I got here. Congress was in the process of enacting this policy of sequestration acrosstheboard cuts. which have had dramatic impacts in my neck of the woods where you have seen workers furloughed. cuts to critical agencies and critical services. In Kitsap County. where I serve. they have ended mental health outreach to senior citizens because of sequestration. We have seen impacts to our regions largest employerthe United States Navy. We have seen impact after impact. If that wasnt enough. we have gone beyondwe all remember the fiscal cliff. We are now at. like. the fiscal mountain range. where we go from selfimposed crisis to selfimposed crisis. First. it was sequestration. then it was a government shutdown. and coming up next is the possibility that our Nation defaults on its financial obligations. Unfortunately. Congress is earning the low regard in which citizens currently hold it. Let me talk a little bit about the shutdown and how it affects the folks that I represent. You have heard a lot about furloughs. I have got in my district 3.500 workers at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard who are now on furlough. Just outside of my district we have Joint Base LewisMcChord10.000 workers have been furloughed. The largest land base in my district is Olympic National Park. which is an extraordinary tourist destination which is now closed for business103 workers at Olympic National Park out on furlough. But it is actually not just the impact to the Federal workforce that should concern us. it is the impact to the private economy. Before I came here I spent my professional career working in economic development. I spent 10 years working in economic development in Tacoma. Washington. I am concerned. for example. that you are seeing a delay in the issuance of Small Business Administration loans because of a government shutdown. I am concerned that this shutdown is at a cost to taxpayers of $150 million to $300 million a day. But primarily I am concerned that. as you have seen Congress govern from crisis to crisis. that we figured the one thing that more than anything businesses want from government. In the 10 years I worked in economic development. the thing I heard more often from employers than anything else was that they looked to government for an environment of trust and predictability. I think Congress has completely messed that up. I will tell you that I dont think it has to be like this. In fact. I came out of a reasonably functional State legislature. The last three bills we passed in the Washington State Senate before I left were a balanced budget. a debt reduction proposal and a jobs bill. Out of the 49 members of the Washington State Senate. the balanced budget passed with all but two votes. the debt reduction proposal passed with all but seven votes. and the jobs bill passed with all but one. It was largely because we worked together. We didnt define ""success"" as making the other side of the aisle look like a failure. I think. frankly. given the challenges facing our country. that gig ought to be up. We should be leading by example. We ought to be working together. We should be solving problems together. I am certainly. as one of 435. trying to do that. It means. for example. when the government shuts down and when the people whom I represent are no longer drawing paychecks. I am not either. Thats why I supported a bill that many of us supported that was known as No Budget. No Pay. which said: if Congress cant pass a budget. Members of Congress shouldnt get paid. When I served in the legislature. I knocked on 52.000 doors. The biggest change in recent years was that people were home because they were out of work. I talked to parents who were concerned that our communitys largest export was going to be our kids. and the vast majority of people I talked to actually did not give a rip about whether we get more Democratic or more Republican or move more to the left or more to the right. They just want us to stop moving backwards and to start moving forward again. So. in the brief minute I have remaining. let me talk about what I think ""forward"" ought to look like. ""Forward"" ought to look like reopening the government. End this government shutdown now. It should mean taking action to make sure our Nation doesnt default on its financial obligations. which is an act that would ensure that costs go up for our small businesses. that costs go up for our families and that everyones retirement goes down. It means working together to ensure that we actually pass a budget. and thats going to take Democrats and Republicans in the House and in the Senate to work together to pass a budget. Were all freshmen up here. When we went through freshman orientation. there was a presentation on how the budget process works. The way it works is that the House passes a budget. and the Senate passes a budget. Then it goes to conference. The House passes appropriations bills. and the Senate passes appropriations bills. Then they go to conference to compromise. After about 40 minutes of presenting that. they then said. Well. that hasnt happened. though. in years. It ought to happen. We should get that back on track. We should get this country back on track. We also need to focus on the economy. I spent a decade working in economic development. We had a sign up on the wall in our office that said: ""We are competing with everyone. everywhere. every day forever."" If we think our competitor nations are participating in the frivolity that our government is currently participating in. we have another think coming. China in the last decade has doubled its number of higher education institutions. They have multiplied fivefold their number of students at colleges and universities on top of the 200.000 students who are studying abroad. primarily in fields of science. technology. engineering. and math. And what are we doing? Here we sit with a government shutdown. impeding our economic recovery. hurting our businesses in this Nation. We cant afford this. We should stop this. We need to get people back to work. but. Madam Speaker. we need to get this Congress back to work. too. Thats why all of us as freshman Members are here. We want to get this country moving forward again."
1130095458,"Mr. Chairman. this amendment would increase funding for the Economic HighTech and Cyber Crime Prevention grant program by $2 million. In my home State of Washington. we develop some of the Nations most advanced software and aircraft and tools for our men and women in uniform. We need to be ready to help our private sector partners protect their intellectual property. competitive edge. and the capabilities of our warfighters. The Economic HighTech and Cyber Crime Prevention program is one of the best opportunities for the Federal Government to assist State and local law enforcement entities to address cyber crimes through the funding of training and technical assistance projects. Specifically. the program was designed to leverage State and local support to help national agencies involved in protecting our homeland security through the prevention of law enforcement against cyber crimes. Cyber crime is not new. but it is becoming an even greater threat to our families. our businesses. and to our national security. As far back as 2012. the Federal Bureau of Investigation made headlines for arresting dozens of cyber criminals worldwide who were involved in a complicated scheme. Recently. the Director of the FBI testified before the other Chamber that statesponsored cyber crime is ""an enormous challenge."" noting the Department of Justice recently issued a 31count indictment against hackers backed by the Chinese Government. As a member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Intelligence. Emerging Threats. and Capabilities. I know that we need to double down on protecting our intellectual property from electronic theft and intrusion. We cannot have innovation stifled out of fear of protection. loss of intellectual property. and future profits. After all. innovation is the engine behind our economy and our national defense. It is what keeps small businesses and large conglomerates devising the next tools to protect our servicepeople and keep shipping lanes open. This amendment would help State. local. and tribal law enforcement agencies with technical assistance. training. and outreach activities. It would provide training in the investigation and prosecution of cyber crimes. increasing the odds that those that seek to do harm are brought to justice. Moreover. it gives the Federal Government a greater opportunity to leverage their counterparts abilities to attain our national goals. One month ago. I was privileged to join representatives of local utilities. the Washington State Military Department. academia. and law enforcement to discuss ways to protect our Nations critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. This summit provided an opportunity for us to bring all of the stakeholders into a room and discuss known vulnerabilities and how we can help each other. One of the most important outcomes of that summit was the need to work together at the local. State. and Federal level. hand in hand with our private sector partners to fully address this threat. That is what this amendment does. It would provide Federal assistance to complement such efforts and would increase our security. With my brief time remaining. I would just like to thank the ranking member and echo the good words of the previous speakers thanking the gentleman. the chairman. for his excellent work and partnership. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130108606,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 5120. the Department of Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2014. In the report. ""Rising above the Gathering Storm."" Paul Otellini. the former CEO of Intel. challenged Congress and challenged the Nation to step up the innovation challenge to grow our economy. Pulitzer Prizewinning columnist George Will wrote. ""Without a change in U.S. Government policy. the next big thing will not be invented here. Jobs will not be created here. and wealth will not accrue here."" I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working together to produce a bipartisan bill targeted at stepping up to that challenge. Our national labs are currently doing innovative research that can hit roadblocks on the path to commercialization. on the path to helping small business run with those innovations. so this bill provides important tools to spur and accelerate the transfer of new technologies developed at our national laboratories and to the private sector. It significantly broadens the range of companies that can participate in a new pilot program with our Federal labs and allows for more flexible partnership agreement terms between the public and private sectors. The bill also allows labs to use their technology transfer funds for activities that identify and demonstrate potential commercial opportunities for their research and technologies. These partnerships between our national labs and the business community will help eliminate gaps in funding by facilitating a path for innovative ideas from basic research to commercial application. Let me tell you why this matters to me. The region I represent is home to the Pacific Northwest National Lab facility. and I have seen firsthand the innovative research being done there. I have also worked closely with our premier research universities to find ways to enable exciting new partnership opportunities. So going beyond just the labs. this bill removes burdens that currently prevent many universities and other nonprofit research institutions from working with the Department of Energy. This bill also streamlines management and coordination of DOEs full spectrum of energy activities. from basic research through commercial application. by establishing a single Under Secretary for Science and Energy. The bill authorizes DOE to partner with the National Science Foundation. so that its researchers can participate in NSFs groundbreaking Innovation Corps program. which matches grant recipients with entrepreneurs to help get their ideas out of the lab and into the marketplace. Lastly. the bill includes important reporting and accountability measures. so that we will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of each of these new tools and determine any additional steps that we should be taking down the road. DOEs national laboratories have been the birthplace of some of our most revolutionary technologies. When this research is harnessed by entrepreneurs and business leaders. startups with only one or two employees can grow into companies that create hundreds of quality jobs. We want to make sure that our national labs. our universities. and all federally -funded institutions and initiatives remain an important foundation of our knowledgebased economy. That is why I was proud to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation. to give scientists and researchers in both the public and private sectors the tools and the freedom that they need to unlock a new wave of great discoveries. I would like to close by noting that this is the kind of bipartisan. cooperative work Congress needs to do if we are going to bolster our global competitiveness. Countries around the world are working to recruit and develop the next generation of innovators. If we are going to have any chance of keeping up. we absolutely have to make research and development a top priority. I am hopeful that we can renew the bipartisan spirit and commitment to making sure tomorrows cuttingedge technology is developed here. not someplace else. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130109927,Madam Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today as someone who went to college with the help of grants and loans and the support of a family and a community that had my back. It is in that spirit that I rise today to offer an amendment designed to help students and borrowers get access to more information about sound financial practices. We know that financial literacy is important. It helps provide people with a roadmap for making sound financial decisions. to avoid or get out of debt. to prepare for emergencies. and to save for a brighter future. Studies have found that 20somethings have an average debt of $45.000. primarily from student loans. but also from car loans. mortgages. and credit card debt. When the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development provided an international financial literacy test. American students ranked below average. We need to do more to promote financial literacy. and it is particularly important that students who are getting federally -supported loans are getting the tools that they need to keep their finances on track. We need to support resources that teach students financial literacy and provide them with the tools that they need to improve decisionmaking and strengthen their household budgets. Helping more students shore up their financial management skills also has a direct impact on the economic and financial stability of our country. Congress took a critical step forward in providing these resources by creating the Financial Literacy and Education Commission as part of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003. legislation that passed the House with overwhelmingly bipartisan support and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. The Financial Literacy and Education Commission developed resources that help consumers better understand financial products. It offers guidance on how to financially prepare for and respond to major life events. and it gives tips on savings and borrowing and deterring fraud. The amendment that I offer today would direct universities and the Department of Education to provide students with information about the financial management resources provided by the Financial Literacy and Education Commission. For many students. a student loan is the first loan of their lives. As students consider the financial assistance that they need to get a decent education. it is critically important that they have the information they need to responsibly manage their finances. I particularly want to applaud the ongoing work and leadership in promoting financial literacy by the cochairs of the House Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus. including Representative HINOJOSA. who has been a strong advocate of financial literacy initiatives and played a critical role in creating this commission. I am also pleased to be joined by my colleague from Alabama . who sponsored this legislation that helped create this commission. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130116527,"I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I would also like to thank Chair CAPITO and Ranking Member MEEKS. as well as Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS. for their efforts to move the American Savings Promotion Act to the floor of the House today. Mr. Speaker. my legislation would remove Federal barriers that today prevent some financial institutions from being able to offer innovative financial products. known as prizelinked savings accounts. These safe. regulated financial products are designed to make savings fun. The more you save. the more chances you have to win. As a Dire Straits fan. I called this idea the ""Money for Nothing"" concept. If you make deposits. you get more chances to win. and even if you dont win. you get to keep the money you saved. Many families understand the importance of saving money to help them manage expected costs like college or retirement and unexpected costs that they might face. whether it is a trip to the emergency room or repairing their cars. but we know too many Americans struggle to set aside a little bit of cash every month. Nearly a quarter of Americans report they wouldnt be able to come up with at least $2.000 in 30 days. Another 19 percent said they could. but they would have to begin pawning or selling their possessions or taking out payday loans. The idea behind prizelinked savings accounts is based on the recognition that people are significantly motivated by rewards. and when it comes to saving money. the idea of earning pennies on the dollar just isnt all that attractive to a lot of folks. particularly those who dont have a lot to save in the first place. Prizelinked savings accounts seek to step into that gap and provide savers with a product that keeps folks excited about saving by offering cash prizes. The research shows that prizelinked savings accounts are actually working to boost savings. The National Bureau of Economic Research recently published an analysis of these accounts. finding that the data ""demonstrate clearly"" that individuals save at a higher rate when they are offered the use of prizelinked savings accounts. Unfortunately. under Federal law. only some financial institutions are able to offer these products. My legislation. which I am proud to have worked on with Representative TOM COTTON. alongside Senators JERRY MORAN and SHERROD BROWN. would clear away the Federal obstacles so that more financial institutions can offer these products. It accomplishes this without establishing a new government program. without spending scarce Federal dollars. and without preempting State laws. Over the past 4 years. an estimated 50.000 account holders have saved more than $94 million using prizelinked savings accounts. Even if those members dont win a big cash prize. they are strengthening their financial cushions to withstand whatever life throws at them while developing a habit of saving. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support the American Savings Promotion Act."

1130052407,Mr. Speaker. we are all concerned about the 800.000 Federal employees who have been furloughed for 3 days in the government shutdown. We can argue back and forth about who caused the shutdown. but the fact is that 800.000 people have been furloughed. and it could stretch into a week or two. While we need to work hard to get these people back to work as soon as possible. we must remember that according to the Congressional Budget Office. ObamaCare is costing us 800.000 jobs permanently. We are not talking about working people being furloughed for a few days. We are talking about the permanent loss of 800.000 American jobs because of this jobkilling health care law. Where is the outrage over that? You see. the fact is the President and my friends across the aisle like to say that they are for the working man. They are for American jobs. But if you pay attention just a little bit. their actions belie their rhetoric. The truth is they are not the party of the working man. they are not the party of jobs. My friends across the aisle are the party of Big Government and more regulation. They believe the American people cannot be trusted to make their own decisions. like how to invest their money or whether to buy health insurance. They know better than the American citizen. They want to make your decisions for you. to take care of you. ObamaCare is just the latest jobkilling iteration of their Big Government expansion. You see. it is only common sense. You dont have to be a genius to understand it. Big Government and Big Regulation do not grow the economy. they stifle the economy. They dont create jobs. they kill jobs. We have 7.3 percent unemployment right now. anemic growth four years after the recession ended. 15 percent unemployment among those under 25. 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or underemployed. I have got three sons who are recent college graduates. They have lived it. We are failing our young people. Remember. Mr. Speaker. that the Democrats held the Presidency. the Senate. and the House for 2 years and out of that came ObamaCare and DoddFrank. two of the biggest governmentexpanding jobkilling laws to be enacted in decades. It is no accident that the economy remains weak. It is no accident that unemployment rates are so high. And now when the Republican House asks simply for a conference. they wont even sit down to discuss it. They refuse to accept anything but the status quo. What is the status quo? Record deficits. high unemployment. and anemic economic growth. I guess with a record like that I wouldnt want to sit down and discuss it either. Mr. Speaker. I dont think anybody here wanted the government to shut down. but perhaps it is good that we have come to this point. Maybe the government shutdown will be a catalyst that brings us together to make some hard decisions. We have got to stop thinking on sixmonth time horizons and create longterm certainty if we want our economy to thrive. Tax reform. deficit reduction. entitlement reformthese are issues that everyone knows must be faced to push our economy forward and to return Americas competitive edge. If we could resolve just a couple of these issues. we would lift a cloud of uncertainty. our economy would grow again. and all Americans would benefit. Nobody wanted this shutdown. but lets take lemons and make lemonade. Lets use this crisis to come together for once and resolve some of these fundamental issues. These are the issues we were sent here to face. I plead with the Senate and the President to rethink your hardline nonegotiation stance. America is counting on us.
1130053781,Mr. President. can we talk? The government is partially shut down. The Nations debt ceiling is looming. President Obama and HARRY REID have drawn a hard line. They have proclaimed over and over again. no negotiation. They insist the debt limit must be raised at current levels of spending. No negotiation. Theyre adamant that the status quo must be preserved. And why not? Here is the status quo: 7.3 percent unemployment 4 years after the recession has ended. 15 percent unemployment for those under 25. 50 percent of recent college graduates unemployed or underemployed. household income down 10 percent in the last 5 years. It has fallen every year since the President has been in office. and it continues to decline. Continued economic stagnation 4 years after the recession has ended. continued record deficit spending. Social Security and Medicare on a path to insolvency. Why would the Republicans want to discuss these fundamental problems? Why would we want to alter that course? By any measure. the Presidents policies are failing miserably: He is failing our seniors. Their safety nets. Social Security and Medicare. are headed for bankruptcy. but he wont negotiate. He is failing our middle class through higher taxes. higher energy costs. higher insurance bills on one hand. and on the other hand. a continued decline in household income. Theyre getting squeezed from both sides. but he wont negotiate. He is failing our youth. the millennial generation. by piling mountains of debt on our children and our grandchildren. but he wont negotiate. He is failing our youth and millennial generation through his jobkilling policies of more regulation. more taxes. and more government. Mr. President. our youth wants to work. and theyre counting on us. but the President wont negotiate. Remember. my friends. that the Democrats held the House. the Senate. and the Presidency for only 2 years. but out of that came ObamaCare and DoddFrank. the two biggest expansions of government and killers of jobs to come out of Washington in 50 years. I didnt want the government to shut downnobody didbut we cannot continue to run headon into failure. If we are to change course. the Republicans cant do it on their own. The President and HARRY REID in the Senate will have to participate.
1130068587,Mr. Speaker. back last summer when the President unilaterally announced that he was going to not enforce the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. I was quite surprised because the next day there was a news article in The New York Times about it. Democratic Senator TOM HARKIN was quoted in the article. He was one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act. He said. speaking of the President: This was the law. How can he do that? How can the President simply unilaterally choose to ignore the law? Our Founders. Mr. Speaker. designed a system of government based upon a separation of powers. The legislative branch enacts the laws and the executive branch. the President. enforces those laws. They did that to protect our very. very fragile freedom. We cannot allow those separations to be eroded. One man who can both make the laws and enforce the laws is more a monarch than a President. Article II. section 3 of the Constitution requires. in part. that the President take care to faithfully execute the Nations laws. In 1792. when George Washington was faced with enforcing an unpopular whiskey tax. he wrote in a letter that: It is my duty to see that these laws are executed. To permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to that duty. President Obama. on the other hand. has. throughout his administration. picked and chosen which laws or parts thereof he wishes to enforce. House Resolution 442 would require the House of Representatives to institute a lawsuit against the President to comply with this article II. section 3 of the Constitution. It lists four specific examples where the President has either failed to enforce the laws or has gone beyond the laws as written: One is the 1year delay in the employer mandate under ObamaCare. which I mentioned earlier. Another is the 1year extension of the substandard insurance policies. which by my definition is any insurance policy anybody would really want to buy. One is the waiving of the work requirements under the welfare laws. and One is the granting of deferred removal action to illegal aliens. Again. one man empowered to both enact the laws and enforce the laws is more a monarch than a President. This is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democrat issue. It is not a Tea Party action. This is not for messaging. H.R. 442 merely recognizes that no American. including the President. is above the law. What would we say if the next President came in and said. I dont like the Affordable Care Act and. therefore. I am not going to enforce the individual mandate. which would gut the law? What would we say if President Obama or any other President said. I think the top income tax rate is too high and. therefore. I am not going to enforce it. or I am not going to enforce the lowest income tax rate? What is the difference between those situations and what President Obama is doing right now not enforcing the employer mandate under ObamaCare? After all. the Supreme Court has ruled that the penalties under ObamaCare are a tax. What would we say if a President said. I am not going to enforce this tax against my friends but I will against my enemies. or I am not going to enforce it against my contributors but I will against everybody else? What is the difference between that situation and what the President has done granting 1.300 unilateral exemptions to different groups under the Affordable Care Act? If the President is allowed to make the law or to ignore those laws passed by Congress. Congress can just go home. there is no need for the legislative branch. In fact. when Congress. following the Presidents lead. when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would delay the employer mandate for a year. which the President had already announced he was going to do unilaterally. the President threatened to veto it. At this time. I yield to Representative MARTHA ROBY from Alabama.
1130086261,Mr. Chairman. the Congressional Progressive Caucus Better Off Budget is really a bigger government budget. The Progressive Caucus substitute increases total spending relative to the Republican budget by $8.4 trillion over the next 10 years. American families. and particularly our children and our grandchildren. cannot afford this next year. and absolutely not for the next 10 years. This bigger government budget creates new taxes. more regulation. duplicative Federal programs. and will stifle progress across the board. People. this is not complicated. We need a budget that will grow our economy. Higher taxes. higher deficits. and bigger regulation will never grow the economy. If we put folks back to work. we solve a lot of problems. We solve unemployment problems. deficit problems. poverty problems. income inequality problems. crime problems. drug problems. and problems across the board. The number one issue in my district. and I believe the number one issue in this Nation. is jobs. Five years after the Great Recession. the economy continues to struggle. and far too many Americans remain out of work. Mr. Obamas Big Government economy has failed. We can solve this problem. It is not rocket science. We can build our economy and put hardworking Americans back to work if only we will take a few steps to make America more competitive. Just like counties across the country compete for jobs. just like States lower tax rates and streamline regulations to attract industry and jobsand you can look at States and see what they are doing and how they are successfulwe must adopt an attitude here in Washington that we will compete in the world if we expect to stop sending our jobs overseas and bring American jobs back home. If we retain the worlds highest corporate tax rate. how can we expect to compete in the world? If Washington continues to spend more than we take in. threatening our entire economy. how can we expect to compete in the world? If we continue to build upon our already oppressive regulatory burden. how can we expect to compete in the world? This is where I believe my friends across the aisle miss the mark. They seem to believe and preach that somehow making this country competitive benefits only the wealthy. But the truth is that people with high assets and high skills do well in a global environment. They can compete from anywhere.

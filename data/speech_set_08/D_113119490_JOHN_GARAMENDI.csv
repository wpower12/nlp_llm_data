1130001137,I would like to move in just a moment to the issue of how we can actually help other parts of our economy grow as we build our infrastructure. But before I do I am just thinking about the previous discussion from our Republican colleagues where they talked about the deficit and the deficit and we ought to eliminate government programs. Certainly there are government programs that are neither efficient. effective. or necessary. and. yes. those should be cut. But when you start talking about infrastructure this is something that we really must do. It was said that for an expenditure of some $15 billion New York City could have protected its subway system and the shoreline from the devastation of two major storms. one that occurred a year ago and another one that occurred just 97 days or 3 months ago. Superstorm Sandy. So if we get ahead of these disasters and build the necessary protections. for example in my district if we build those levees. yes. it will cost money. For the Natomas area its about $1 billion. Very expensive. no doubt about it. But if we do not protect and do not build those levees the devastation will amount to several times that amount of money. Thats precisely what happened in Manhattan and in the New York City area. So again. you spend that money up front. yes. you put people to work. yes. there may be an immediate issue of where and how we fund it. and thats a legitimate issue. but fail to do it and then the cost is horrendous. And. yes. if the State. the Federal. the local governments. the individuals. that will all be an expense that they have to endure. And Superstorm Sandy. the bill we saw today. is precisely on that. Now. having said that. lets talk about the broader subject. You mentioned Build American Bonds just a moment ago. The Build American Bonds were part of the stimulus program. now almost 4 years old. [- 2030 That program created a new mechanism to assist local governments in providing the funding to build infrastructurevery. very successful in putting people back to work. We could extend that. In doing so. we will put people back to work. We will build the infrastructures. whether those are highways or bridges or whatever. As we do that. one of our favorite topics that weve talked on this floor many. many times about is this: We can Make It in America. We use our taxpayer money to make and to spend that money on Americanmade products. So the steel in the bridges. the concrete. the other design elements are American jobs. And as we do that. we rebuild the American manufacturing base. Youve talked about this extensively. You go back in history. but go for it.
1130019232,Well. thats exactly the problem. We need to get this sequestration out of the way of Americas growth. There are many things that we can do. Id like to remind everybody that the President. more than 2 years ago. put forth an American jobs proposal. an American Jobs Act. In that proposalwhich has never been taken up by the leaders of the House of Representativesthose who are in control of the House now. our colleagues here on the right side of the aisle. have never taken it up. So what was in it? There was a $50 billion immediate investment in infrastructure. Well. what is infrastructure? Infrastructure is highways. our roads. our streets. our sanitation facilities. our water facilities. airports. flood levees. the kinds of things that upon which the economy can grow and be built. It is the foundation of the economy. They brushed it aside. wouldnt even consider it. One of the most basic things that any economy. any government must do is to make sure the foundation is in place. The President had also proposedand its part of our Make It in Americaan educational program to make sure that our students are ready for the jobs that are part of the American economy today and to retrain American workers. A proposal that I have is that our tax dollars be spent on Americanmade equipment. Oh. my. how strange would that be. But yet we go out and buy Chinese steel to build the new San FranciscoOakland Bay Bridge. No. we dont buy Americanmade steel and give Americans the jobs. we turn the jobs over to China. Wind turbines. solar panels. all of the new energy systems. our tax money supports those systems. Shouldnt we be buying Americanmade equipment with your tax money? I believe we should. Thats my legislation. The Democratic agenda. the Make It in America agenda. is about 30 different bills dealing with rebuilding the great American manufacturing sector. I know that if we were to carry these policies forward. if they were to become law. we would see a resurgence in the American manufacturing sector. The reason that that is so important is thisMr. CLYBURN spoke to this earlier when he was here. Ive got a little different display. This is whats happened to the American middle class. and beyond. Im going to use a football analogy hereI played football back at the University of California a few years agoactually. many years ago. So we can use a football analogy. The bottom 99 percent of America. 99 percent of every family and 99 percent of all of the workers and men and women in America have. since 1966. seen a net increase in their takehome pay of $59. This is in constant dollars. The top 10 percent have seen their income grow by $116.071 over that period. 66 to 2011. The top 1 percentremember the 99 percent thing? Well. this is the top 1 percenthave seen their income grow by $628.817. Now. the very. very tippy top. that is. the onetenth of 1 percentwere talking the superwealthy billionaires here. Mitt Romney wouldnt fit into this categorythey have seen their income grow by over $18 million annually. So what were seeing in the American economy is a skewing of the wealth in this economy. Literally. the wealth in the economy is flowing to the very top so that the wage increases are not among the men and women that work every day. that put in their 40 hours a week or more. But. rather. its flowing to those at the top. This is the result of economic policies that are put in place here in the Congresstax policies. educational policies. other kinds of policies that lay the foundation for this extraordinary inequality. This has never been seen in America. During the Gilded Age in the 19th century. this kind of wealth disparity was not in existence. During the Roaring Twenties. this type of wealth inequality was not seen in the American economy. Only now. in the last 20. 30 years. have we seen policies put in place that have created the most inequality ever in modern American history. [- 1700 What does that mean? What does that mean to the average American family? It means that both mom and pop are working. It means that they cannot afford to send their children to school. And added on top of that. the Great Recession has stripped the wealth from the 90 percent. The wealth was stripped. mostly in the housing market collapse. So now we are faced with the situation. what can we do? Well. what we can do is to rebuild the American manufacturing sector. because this is where the middle class had decent wages. We are not talking about a $7.50 an hour minimum wage. We are talking about wages that a man or a woman could earn to protect and to provide for their family.
1130020911,SHEILA JACKSON LEE. thank you so very much. You are a leader in all of these issues. Youve often and almost always present these issues to the American people on the floor of the House. and you do it with passion and knowledge. There was an hour spent earlier by our colleagues about the 37th time that theyre going to attempt to repeal the Affordable Health Care Act. It reminded me that they also have a piece of legislation to end Medicare as we know it. If you go back to when Medicare was put in place in the sixties. 1964. 1965. the Republican Party opposed it then and have often. through those years. to this date. attempted in various ways to eviscerate or to end it as we know it. Apparently theyre going to try to do the same thing with the Affordable Health Care Act. It is such a waste of time because these programs are so fundamental to our ability to survive. This is health care for Americans and spreading that opportunity out. Its a long discussion. Weve had that discussion on the floor for many days. What we really ought to be focusing on is putting Americans back to work. This piece of legislation is one of about 30 pieces of legislation thats put in by the Democratic Caucus. This is mine. It deals with your tax money. It simply says that its going to be spent on Americanmade clean energy. solar panels. wind turbines and the like. Its not a bad idea to spend your tax money on Americanmade equipment. American jobs. American businesses. Theres another bill that I have dealing with the transportation system. Its the same thing. That bill is now finding its way into the rewrite of the highway transportation program. the transportation bill. and hopefully it will be there. Its a very strong buyAmerican provision for our buses. our trains. our light rail. locomotives and steel and concrete for bridges. Weve got a lot of work to do in America. Weve got a lot of work and a lot of need. and this House ought to be spending its time on that. Well take another night and well go into the tax policy side of this. which there is a lot to be said about changing our taxes to encourage manufacturing. Some of that has been done. Ill leave the one example that 2 years ago when the Democrats controlled this House. we eliminated about $12 billion of tax breaks that American companies received for shipping American jobs overseas. We put a stop to that. Theres about another $5 billion that needs to be done. but we no longer control this House. But we ought to bring those jobs back home. We ought to flip that over and give a tax break for reshoring. bringing the jobs back to America. Thats another nights discussion. Well take that up in another evening. But for tonight. its about putting Americans back to work. Its about focusing the attention of this Chamber. the 435 of us. on what we really need in this country. which is a very strong and growing economy. Weve seen progress every quarter since the beginning of 2010. Every quarter weve seen private sector employment grow. Were not where we ought to be. We have more work to do. And when we finally rebuild the American manufacturing sector. when once again we make it in America. Americans are going to make it. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130035608,mentioned the 37th Congress and Abraham Lincoln. In the middle of the worst catastrophe this countrys experienced. a civil war. that Congress understood that we had to make investments as a Federal Government if this country was going to prosper and grow. and allowed the private sector to take up where we left off. And thats why they invested in the Transcontinental Railroad. Thats why they created the Homestead Act. Thats why they created the United States Department of Agriculture. Thats why they created the land grant college/university system. The idea that the private sector can do it. we dont need to do itwell. the Internet was 100 percent a Federal investment. It was called DARPANET. and it stayed a Federal investment for 25 years. until the commercial application was clear. and then it went private. Whatever we invested in DARPANET was worth every penny in how its transformed American life. GPS. entirely a Federal investment. not a private sector investment. And its the private sector thats understood the commercial applicability. Thats the partnership that has characterized all of our history. not some of it. And to substitute a false narrative for that involvement will guarantee that the Chinese will clean our clock in the next generation. I sat here hours ago and listened to our Republican colleagues from Washington and Tennessee say. without fear of understanding their own contradiction. we need the Federal Government to clean up these nuclear sites. not the private sector. the Federal Government. This isnt just a bad amendment. This is about a profound philosophical disagreement about the future role of the Federal Government. Investments have returns. Not all spending is the same. and we need to be enhancing investments in this bill. not cutting them back. if we want to hand over to the next generation a competitive America that still helps provide a shining light upon a hill. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California .
1130050955,Mr. HONDA. thank you so very much. and thank you for your lifetime of service. your early years in the Peace Corps in El Salvador. the work that you did there. and. as you said. bringing it home and continuing to serve right up through this day and beyond as you continue to represent the great Silicon Valley of California. So thank you very much for all that you have done over these many years. You mentioned something that Im going to turn to very quickly. I was the insurance commissioner. and one of the things that we wanted to do in California. but we couldnt get the legislature to pass. was the Patients Bill of Rights. Some of this we tried to do with regulations. but the Patients Bill of Rights is now the law of the land. When our Republican colleagues came forward with a continuing resolution that was actually a sequestration and a low level of funding and added to it the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Im going: Wait a minute. You want to repeal the Patients Bill of Rights? Im going to run through this very quickly. Children with preexisting conditions. young children at birth or in the early years that have developed some serious medical condition before the Patients Bill of Rights which now is in effect this day. children cannot be denied coverage. period. There are thousands upon thousands of children across this Nation that find themselves in this situation. Young adults at the age of 18. prior to the Patients Bill of Rightsand this has been in effect for more than a year nowat the age of 18. they were off of their parents coverage and they were out there on their own. often unable. particularly if they were a woman. to be able to get insurance. But the Patients Bill of Rights allows them to stay on their parents insurance until they are 26. and there are more than 6.6 million young Americans 18 to 26 that are now on their parents health coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Women have the right to health care coverage without discrimination for all kinds of thingsbreast cancer. pregnancy. and other kinds of illnesses that women might get. Prior to the Patients Bills of Rights and the Affordable Care Act. there was heavyduty discrimination against women. They couldnt get insurance. If they could. they would pay substantially more. Were talking that half of the population of America. at one time or another. womenactually. more than halfwere facing this discrimination. but no longer with the Patients Bill of Rights. Seniors have a right to affordable medication and also to an annual wellness visit. which actually has dramatically reduced the ongoing inflation rate in Medicare. bending the curve. And then finally. this one down here. every American has the right to health care coverage without a limitation on the annual amount that you could spend. A family with a cancer case would blow right through the limitation. Theyd be on their own. And this is what led to the enormous number of personal bankruptcies. more than 50 percent of which were caused by health care problems. So the Patients Bill of Rights was. according to our Republican colleagues. to be repealed along with all of the Affordable Health Care Act. Needless to say. those of us on the Democratic side said. This is wrong. This is not good for America. Its not good for Americans. individuals. children. or adults. And we fought the fight. Were not finished with this yet. Although as of today. it appears as though our Republican colleagues have dropped the issue of defunding. delaying. or repealing the Affordable Health Care Act as far as the continuing resolution is concerned. I will come back. I will cover some of these things again. I would like now to turn to our new colleague from San Antonio. Texas. JOAQUIN CASTRO. Please join us. You have a great background in that city. And you come with an extraordinary reputation. well earned. as a scholar and as a great citizen of San Antonio.
1130056577,Mr. Speaker. it is a rather important day today. Sometime today or in the next 24 hours. the United States Treasury will run out of its ability to borrow money. that is. to roll over its debt. to pay all of the obligations that the United States Government has. I guess. even this morning. we remain the worlds biggest economy. We certainly remain the oldest democracy. although. that seems to be somewhat in doubt here on the floor of the House of Representatives where we dont operate as a democracy. We really operate more as a dictatorship. or at least as an oligarchy. in which one or two or a handful of people makes the decision for the majority of the House. It is a very. very. very important moment that this Nation moves towards. the moment in which it. for the first time in its history. would default on its payments. default on its debt. We have already seen the effects of this. Banks all around the world are selling. that is. getting out of Americas shortterm obligations or those obligations. bonds. that are due now or in the next week or so. So they are shedding American debt. They are running away from the worlds reserve currency. Why? Because this House. the House of Representatives. the peoples House. is being jerked around. led around by a small contingent of folks who is not thinking clearly. who is not willing to understand the import. the importance. of the soundness of the American dollar. the importance of the full faith and credit of this Nation. of the 200plus years of history where this House. where this government. where the people of America have always stood behind its obligations. But that group of individuals who is unwilling to be rational. who is the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party. seems to want to take this Nation into a new era. an era in which the world cannot count on the United States of America. We are also in the 16th day of the shutdown of the United States Government in which the United States Government is only partially operating. in which the national parks. with the exception of just three. are not open. where the Fish and Wildlife Services refuges are not available to the public. where much of the government is not operating. We are in the 16th day. Why? Why are we in this situation? When it started 16 days ago. it was to end the Affordable Health Care Act. and then it was to modify it. and then it was to change it. and then it was to delay it. and now it is not even on the agenda. So why are we still shut down? There is no reason that is being presented other than what you might see in a preschool class with some kid who is too tired and is down on the floor. throwing a tantrum. screaming and yelling and trying to stop everything. Kid. get your blanket. Get your bottle and take a nap. We dont need tantrums around here. but apparently that is the only reason the government continues to be shut down. because some 40 or 50 Members of the Tea Party caucus of the Republican Party are throwing a tantrum. led by Senator CRuz. We dont need tantrums. we need cooperation. we need to work together. We have got serious problems. The shutdown has created even more serious problems and. as we run up to the debt crisis. yet one more problem. because 40 or 50 people are throwing a tantrum. This is the House of Representatives. 435 of us elected to represent the people of America. to do right by them. to do right by this Nations economy. by the working men and women. Even those who are laid off because of the shutdown want to work. It is time for us to end this. It is time for us to go to work on the longterm problems.
1130097627,Mr. Chairman. I understand the point of order. We are going to be facing that with my other six amendments. but I would like to speak to this issue and also to the others at the same time. and I will drop the other amendments. Yesterday. I had the pleasure of driving across San Francisco Bay on the brandnew east San Francisco Bay Bridge. a multibilliondollar project. The steel of that project in its main section was built in China. It was fabricated in China. The Chinese steel company built a new steel mill. the most advanced in the world. There were 3.000 Chinese jobs and zero American jobs. The way they are able to get around the Buy American provisions is that the State of California segmented the multibilliondollar project into 20 different pieces. therefore avoiding the Buy America provisions on this crucial center span of that bridge. This amendment would prohibit that from ever happening again. The other amendments speak to the $50 billion that is going to be spent by this bill and would require. in various ways. that that money be spent here in America on Americanmade goods. American steel. American products. and on American workers. We ought to buy in America. We ought to make this other national policy. We ought never have another Bay Bridge. We ought to do what we did in the American Recovery Act that required that some $800 million for Amtrak locomotives be spent on 100 percent Americanmade. Indeed. Siemens. a German company. has established a manufacturing plant in Sacramento to manufacture those locomotives. One of the other amendments I will not be taking up tonight deals specifically with the rolling stock for public transportation. that it. too. be Americanmade and that we increase the percentage of American content from 60 percent to 100 percent. This is American taxpayer money. That money ought to be spent in America. American taxpayers should demand it. The Members of Congress should demand that their taxpayers money be spent on Americanmade equipment. goods. and services. This is part of the Make It In America agenda. It is most specific here at this time. as we are about to. in the next day. spend $50 billion of American taxpayer money. Are we going to spend it on Americanmade equipment. American goods and services? Or are they going to be coming from China or somewhere else in the world? The question is very straightforward for all of us. Unfortunately. because of the point of order that will be raised on this and the other six amendments. we will not have a chance tonight. tomorrow. and perhaps in the days ahead. to really do something for America in rebuilding our manufacturing sector by requiring that our taxpayer money be spent on Americanmade goods. services. and on American workers. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130121055,Madam Speaker. I want today to talk about an illness that affects every American family. It is an illness that is devastating. It is Alzheimers and related dementia. It is the most expensive illness in America today. and it will become even more expensive in the future. Today. $1 out of $5 spent by Medicare is spent treating Alzheimers. most expensive of all our illnesses. As we look to the future. we are going to find that this disease. Alzheimers. is going to grow over $1.5 trillion of costs by 2050. partly due to the baby boomers and their growth in the demography of this Nation. but also because of the extraordinary expense that this illness brings to us. This is the power curve that we are looking at. If you are concerned about the deficit. you need to be concerned about Alzheimers. If you are concerned about the American family. you need to be concerned about Alzheimers. Here is what we are looking at for what is the second biggest cost in the Federal budget. that is. Medicare and Medicaid. Here is the growth that we are looking over the period of the next 35 years. from some $122 billion to over $880 billion. As you look at the Federal budget in the years ahead. as you look at Medicare. as you begin to think about the deficit that confronts this Nation. this is where you need to look because this is where the big expenditure is going to be made. It is going to be in Alzheimers and related illnesses to it. This is it. What can we do about this? We could sit and fuss and fume. we can take care of our seniors. or we can recognize the reality of what it means when we spend money on research. when we spend money on getting ahead of the illnesses. These are the major illnesses that confront America today. You can take a look here. Breast cancer. there has been a decrease in mortality. prostate cancer. a decrease. heart disease. a 16 percent decrease. stroke. a 23 percent decrease. and of course. HIV/AIDS. an extraordinary 42 percent decrease in the deaths from these major illnesses. Over here on the purple one on the right. Alzheimers. Decrease? No. Increase? Sixtyeight percent increase from 2000 to 2010. This is the reality of the most prevalent and most expensive and the most devastating disease that confronts Americans and really the rest of the world. What can we do about it? Lets take a look at this chart. Alzheimers spending treatment versus research. Lets see. We are spending $150 billion on the treatment. This is Medicare and Medicaid. and research. oh. way down here. $566 million on research. So if you want to drive the deficit to even greater depths. treat but dont do research. However. if you want to solve this problem. we know how to do it. In fact. we have done it many. many times. If you take a look at cancer. we are spending $5.418 billion on cancer research. Cancer deaths are down. HIV. we are spending $2.978 billion on HIV/ AIDS. HIV/AIDS deaths are down by 42 percent. Cardiovascular. $2 billion. Cardiovascular deaths. strokes and heart disease down. Alzheimers. $566 million. We know the answer. The question is whether we are willing to put our money where we can solve the most devastating. the most prevalent. and the most expensive of all illnesses. Change this little purple. bring it back up perhaps to $2 billion a year. as we do with HIV/AIDS. cardiovascular. and cancer. Spend the research money. We are close in many. many ways across this Nation with programs that are under way. Here is the specific ask that I make to this Congress: not $2 billion. but $200 million additional money in the appropriations that we are doing today-$200 million.
1130122643,Mr. TONKO. thank you so very much for your bringing to us the information about actions that have already been taken. The Alzheimers plan that you discussed lays out a process by which the National Institutes of Health will develop a program of research. bring it directly to Congress so that we can then analyze it and hopefully fund that research. It is the pragmatic way of dealing with it. As you said. it is based upon a studied stepbystep process to get to the solution of Alzheimers. There is also other legislation. Our former colleague. now Senator MARKEY. put together a bill that is called the HOPE Act. and that is one that would require that Medicare take specific account of Alzheimers. and that in the Medicare program. there be a method for Medicare to fund early diagnosis of Alzheimers and then the early treatment. As was said by one of our colleagues earlier. a delay of a couple of years or 3 or 4 years in the onset of serious Alzheimers is extraordinarily beneficial to the individual and to the family. and. in a larger context. to the budget of the individual family. their insurance company. as well as the Federal government through Medicare and Medicaid. So that program also speaks to the caregiving that is necessary and Medicare picking this up. It is clearly going to be the illness that will bust the bank unless we can get ahead of it. and that is where the research comes into focus and into play. We can do this. There is another angle to this. I was going to take this up with Mr. FATTAH when he was here. He was talking about other agencies and other governments that are involved in dealing with this. About a month ago I had the opportunity to spend about an hour with the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Mr. McDonald. and we were talking about the various challenges that the Department of Veterans Affairs has dealing with all of the veterans. and it wasnt long before the conversation turned to traumatic brain injury and PTSD. posttraumatic stress syndrome. both of which are illnesses or problems of the human brain. We were discussing how the Department of Veterans Affairs is dealing with this. It turns out that they also have a research budget. and we know that he was unaware of some of the research that was going on both at the NIH and what Mr. FATTAH talked about. the One Mind program that our former colleague Mr. Kennedy is involved in in pulling together the research that is available around the world. bringing that research together so that the synthesis of it could be a much more rapid solution to the problems that Mr. McDonald faces in the Veterans Administration dealing with posttraumatic stress illnesses as well as traumatic brain injury. So all of these things come together. and in dealing with it. ultimately we carry a heavy burden of responsibility here in Congress.

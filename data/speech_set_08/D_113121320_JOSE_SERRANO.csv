1130011678,"Mr. Chair. as the Ranking Member of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee. I am voting ""no"" on the Continuing Resolution sent back to us by the Senate. This bill underfunds several important programs and initiatives. and does not provide adequate funding to continue the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and DoddFrank. Moreover. this bill compounds that harm by allowing the sequester to continue. I am particularly disturbed by serious problems in the Financial Services and General Government section of the bill. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is flat funded at fiscal year 2012 levels. before taking into account the effects of sequestration. This funding level will greatly harm the continued implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This is a critical year for the ACA as the state exchanges prepare to go live. and as part of that effort. the IRS had asked for an additional $254 million in funding to help administer several upcoming ACA tax credits and tax changes. Failing to provide this funding will hamper IRS efforts to continue the implementation of these important effortswhich will help individuals and small businessesand will create more confusion by not providing the IRS with the resources to answer taxpayers questions. In addition. the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is flatfunded at fiscal year 2012 levels despite a requested $94 million increase. This funding level. further reduced by sequestration. will hinder the SEC in the continued implementation of DoddFrank. and will harm its enforcement duties. The SEC still needs to implement several of the most important DoddFrank rules and reforms. and this funding level will only slow that effort. This bill prevents the SEC from being the strong ""cop on the beat"" that we need to ensure that the abuses that helped cause the fiscal meltdown dont recur. Moreover. our Federal Public Defenders. who are part of the Federal Judiciary budget. actually receive a small increase of $9 million above the fiscal year 2012 level. However. this amount is less than they requested. and not enough to offset the overwhelming impact of sequestration. Our Federal Public Defenders provide indigent criminal defendants with their constitutionally protected right to counsel. and the effect of the CR and sequestration will substantially damage their ability to do their utmost to help their clients. Lastly. federal employees are once again asked to endure a pay freeze. Our federal employees have already contributed an incredible amount of money to deficit reduction. and another federal pay freeze will only prevent the recruitment and retention of a qualified and committed workforce. In reality. while this bill purports to maintain finding levels at the FY 2012 level. sequestration means further damaging cuts to these and other accounts. We need a solution that will prevent important services that all Americans depend on from being impacted. and allows all agencies the flexibility to address the current effect of the sequester. This bill fails in that regard."
1130050782,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise. reluctantly. to oppose this bill. While. of course. we support freeing up D.C. to spend its own local funds. a policy weve asked to be made permanent. this is a sham of a process and a fake bill designed by the Tea Party. for the Tea Party. and of the Tea Party. Its not a sudden concern or awakening to realize that D.C.. this morning. needed all this help. My God. to those of you whove been around for a while. you know that Ive made an appropriations career out of telling people to treat the District of Columbia with respect. And all of a sudden. as part of its continuing attack on ObamaCare. your party comes up now and comes with a piecemeal approach to a major issue. Instead. its part of a strategy to try to draw attention away from the legislative hostagetaking which is hurting people around the Nation. Additionally. I would be remiss if I did not point out that this bill continues an unnecessary and harmful rider that prevents the District of Columbia from expending its own funds. its own funds. on abortion services. No other State in the Nation has such a restriction. Although. I repeat. I support D.C. being able to spend its own money. I do not know why this is the only portion of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee bill being considered to date. I must tell you. and I dont know how my leadership will feel about this statement. but Ive got to give you credit. because just when I thought you had run out of gimmicks to bring to the floor. this one takes the cake. a piecemeal approach of three bills that do not speak to any resolution of any issue. Many agencies under our jurisdiction have suffered. or will suffer. devastating problems as a result of the Republican Federal Government shutdown. but youre doing nothing about those agencies in this bill. The Republican shutdown has forced the Small Business Administration to furlough almost twothirds of its workforce. This has forced the agency to shutter almost all of its loan programs for our Nations small businesses. including loan programs for veterans. womenowned small businesses. and small businesses located in underserved areas. but youre not saying anything about that in this bill. The Federal defenders currently have enough funding to continue operations for a couple of weeks. However. once that time is up. they will be unable to fulfill their constitutional duty to uphold the Sixth Amendment rights of criminal defendants. but you dont speak to that at all in this bill. The CPSC has been cut from 540 employeeslisten to this. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has been cut from 540 employees to 22. making it difficult for the agency to perform its duty of fully reviewing thousands of different kinds of products. This will clearly increase the risk to the public. but we dont speak to that. The IRS. the agency that always takes the biggest hit during this period of time. has been forced to let go most of their workforce. preventing the agency from providing taxpayer assistance to those who have questions. examining questionable tax returns. or even to accept paper tax filings. The IRS brings in the vast majority of our Nations revenue. The Republican shutdown is harming our ability to pay our bills. All of these agencies need and deserve a continuing resolution so they can perform the many functions of government that remain essential to American consumers. investors. taxpayers. and small businesses. Let me try to save you some time. Some of you newer folks will get up and say: Oh. my God. you are attacking the District of Columbia. No one. except for Ms. NORTON. has a clearer record on supporting the District of Columbia. I have said often enough on this floor that having been born in an American territory called Puerto Rico. I take very seriously how I look at and the respect that I have for the District of Columbia. But this is a joke. This is simply another approach at trying to get around the real issue. which is we need to bring a clean CR to the floor. and we will continue to push for that. I urge a ""no"" vote on this bill when it comes for a vote. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130050831,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time. This is not an easy time. You would hate to think that 23 years of agreeing with Ms. NORTON on the issue of the D.C. budget and how we should treat D.C. goes up in smoke in one afternoon. We have never disagreed. and I know that starting in about 30 seconds or 1 minute or 2 minutes. we wont disagree again. But we also cannot be ignorant of the fact that this is a sham. that this is part of a trick. It is a good trick. it is one that sells. In fact. the results may show that it is one that sells. but it is still a trick. It is a trick still to get at ObamaCare on the day that it starts to take place all over this country. It is still a trick to keep the government closed. It is a trick to say that we will single out certain people. certain monuments. certain areas. certain needs. but not others. It is easy for me personally to say ""yes"" to this bill on the District of Columbia. But I also know that in another territory or in another place without congressional representation. they had to close down this morning the WIC offices because there are no people to be able to run that office. In other parts that do have representation. they had to close down areas of services where people need those services. We know what the game is. I know it is not easy for some of us to get up and oppose certain things. but we have to. We have to because if we continue to allow the House to be run by a Member of the other body. we will never get anywhere. It is funny how much time we spend among ourselves knocking the other body. and yet we have a situation now where a Member of the other body is telling everybody over here what to do on one side. Thats the problem we have. As painful as this is for me and as difficult as it will be to stay out of the way of Ms. NORTON for the next day or two. I still think that the proper vote here is a ""no"" vote because we need a clean CR and we need a full approach. not a piecemeal approach. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130053865,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me start by saying that I wish we were here on the floor today in order to consider a bill that would reopen the entire Federal Government. This bill would pay all excepted Federal employees across the Federal Government as they would normally be paid irrespective of the shutdown. This is the right thing to do for all of our excepted Federal employees who have continued to work during the shutdown. While this bill will provide some certainty to those individuals. we all know that there is a much easier and better method of accomplishing this goal. and that is to consider and pass the clean Senate continuing resolution which would reopen our Federal Government immediately. Im still unclear as to why Republicans are refusing to allow a vote on the most basic solution to this reckless shutdown. While this bill guarantees timely pay for our employees. it does not reopen the Federal Government. That means it does nothing to solve the many problems the American people are facing as a result of the Republican decision to shut down the government. Within the subcommittee that I am the ranking member of. the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. the shutdown has required the Small Business Administration. for instance. to furlough almost twothirds of its workforce. The agency has had to shutter almost all of its loan programs for our Nations small businesses. including loan programs for veterans. womenowned small businesses. and small businesses located in underserved areas. Within the Federal judiciary. the Federal defenders currently have enough funding to continue operations for a couple of weeks. However. once that time is up. they may be unable to fulfill their constitutional duty to uphold the Sixth Amendment rights of criminal defendants. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has been cut from 540 employees to 22. making it near impossible for the agency to perform its duty of fully reviewing thousands of different kinds of products. This will clearly increase the risk to the public. The IRS has been forced to furlough most of its workforce. preventing the agency from providing taxpayer assistance to those who have questions. to examine questionable tax returns. or even to accept paper tax filings. The IRS brings in the vast majority of our Nations revenue. and the Republican shutdown is harming our ability to pay our bills. The American people need a full continuing resolution so that their government can perform the many duties that remain essential to American consumers. investors. taxpayers. and small businesses. A clean CR would do just that. I realize that the majority wants to do this piecemeal. one at a time. I think Im doing some math. and at this rate. the full government would be open by 2025. so Im hoping we can do it before that. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130053885,I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. we keep saying it. and the folks who keep watching us wonder why we keep saying itor maybe they know why we keep saying it. Little by little. you are reopening the government. but it may take until 2025 to accomplish it at this level. So our hope would be that we just pass the resolution that was passed in the Senate and open the government. Now. this one is an easy one. Everyone is going to vote for this bill. In fact. this bill should pass on a voice vote so that we can get folks and pay them properly for the services theyre rendering. but there are other people who need to come to work. There are other people who need to service the American people. There are Americans who need to be serviced. and this is not the way for us to behave. A little bit of historyand I know that some people in the last couple of days have either refused to mention it or gave up on itand that is that this all started not because there were differences in economic reasoning or behavior. It started because a group of people on your side wanted to attach killing ObamaCarethe Affordable Care Actand they were willing to do whatever they needed to do to accomplish that. Thats not going to happen. How many times do we have to say that bill was passed by the House. passed by the Senate. signed by the President. and upheld by the Supreme Court? I dont know how many laws you can say that about in this country that we dont go after. and yet some folks just wont give up. The time is now for us to open up the government. The time is now for us to pass this bill. to respect our Federal workers. but also to respect the American people in general by making sure that the government is open. Take up the resolution. It will pass in 2 seconds. I assure you. In fact. I predict that if you bring that resolution to the floor. you may be shocked to get a unanimous vote. because thats what we want to doto open up the government and then move on to deal with the issues that we have to deal with. So lets do it. and lets do it quickly. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130106311,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am saddened to have to rise in opposition to this legislation today. As a longtime appropriator. I remember the days when we were always able to come together to determine the funding levels for our government in a bipartisan manner and with little partisan warfare. Unfortunately. this bill is not a product of those times. I do not say this to blame Chairman CRENSHAW or Chairman ROGERS. as they have always listened to the concerns that our side has had and have tried to accommodate us when they could. Mr. CRENSHAW is a great working partner. and he knows that that famous line is really true in this case: it is not personal. it is about this issue. There are many things we have been able to agree on as a result. but they have also been forced to listen to a portion of their caucus that is not interested in the business of governing. and as a result. the good portions of this bill are overwhelmed by the problems that this legislation has. Let me discuss just a few of the more serious shortfalls of this bill. starting with a seriously inadequate allocation. This subcommittee received an unacceptably low 302(b) allocation that is $566 million below last years bill. Percentage wise. this is a cut of 2.6 percent. a level that no other subcommittee has been forced to take. The result is that there are several agencies in this bill that are not funded properly. Primary among these is the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS is funded at $10.95 billion. a cut of $341 million below last year. This means the agency would operate at a level that is below sequestrationfunding levels that were already grossly inadequate. I assume this is being done both as some sort of collective punishment of the Exempt Organizations unit for the problems associated with their scrutiny of liberal and conservative 501(c)(4) organizations. and as one final attempt to hinder the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We already heard from the chairman that they dont think this committee should be involved with the Affordable Care Act. We keep forgetting that it was passed by both Houses. signed by the President and upheld by the Supreme Court. These actions are irresponsible. and they do more to hurt the American people than does the IRS. Rather than investing in further training to prevent the problems that happened previously or ensuring that we have the resources to go after tax cheats. the majority has chosen to play politics with the agency that brings in the vast majority of our Nations revenue. Unfortunately. these funding levels will prevent the agency from collecting money from tax cheats. expand the tax gap. and increase our deficit. Talk about fiscal irresponsibility. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also severely underfunded at a level of $1.4 billion. This is $300 million below the request and is simply insufficient to allow the agency to properly oversee Wall Street and protect investors. including many retirees who have 401(k) and pension plans that are invested in the marketplace. Both parties have created additional responsibilities for the SEC in recent years. but funding has not kept pace. If we keep asking the agency to do more with less. then we cannot be surprised if we experience another financial crisis. There are numerous other cuts to the bill that are harmful as well. including the elimination of the Election Assistance Commission. cuts to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. the Federal Communications Commission. and the General Services Administration. all of which have negative impacts on the operations of our Federal Government and private sector job growth. However. I believe that the biggest impediment to reaching compromise on this bill is the large number of partisan riders that have been added. Let me name just a few of the more excessive. all of which are major concerns to our side of the aisle. There are riders preventing the IRS from implementing the Affordable Care Act and from reforming the 501(c)(4) regulations. which have caused so much confusion and abuse. There is a rider limiting Americans ability to travel to Cuba on peopletopeople visas. There is a rider preventing the SEC from requiring publiclytraded companies to disclose their campaign donations to their shareholders. even though there is no indication that the agency has plans to do so. There is a rider that prevents the provision of abortion services in multistate health plans under the Affordable Care Act. There are riders preventing the District of Columbia from using its own funds to provide legal abortion services to lowincome women and to determine its own local criminal justice laws with regard to marijuana. This is. by no means. an exhaustive list. The number of riders on this bill seems endless. I have no doubt that we will be asked to add even more to this list during debate on this bill. Before we do that. I would point out that we have spent a lot of time this year discussing how to ensure a return to regular order in the appropriations process. I would suggest that it is extremely difficult to do so when the majority attempts to pack legislation with a laundry list of partisan priorities. This is irresponsible governing. at best. and they make a mockery of one of this institutions most important functions. to fund the Federal Government. When we choose politics over the needs of the American people. we should not be surprised when those same people become cynical about their elected representatives. The appropriations process is not and should not be the place to add every partisan priority that the other side cannot pass through the regular legislative process. I feel confident that the American people would rather just have us get on with our jobs. instead of rehashing the same arguments over the Affordable Care Act. DoddFrank. and many other issues. Our side will attempt to remedy some of these defects through the amendment process. although with the inadequate allocation. it will be difficult to do so. Unfortunately. as it is currently written. this is not a bill that I can support. Before I finish. let me take a moment to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for their hard work on this bill. They have all devoted many hours to creating this bill and report. and I know I speak for all the Members on our side when I say that we are grateful for the hard work that they have put into this bill. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130106377,These are important matters. and I thank them for the opportunity to present this amendment. My amendment is a simple theory. but a very important one. This amendment provides $100.000 to the IRS taxpayer services account to assist parents who have lost dependent children during the tax year with assistance in filing income taxes and supports onestop IRS tax preparation support for parents of deceased dependent children whose childs SS number has been stolen and used by identity thieves to steal tax refunds. I am the founder and cochair of the Congressional Childrens Caucus. and in many instances. we find in our work the issues of giving children incentives and worrying about childrens health. but this is a very devastating posture for parents to be in. At a hearing held by Chairman SAM JOHNSON on the Ways and Means Committee. a hearing on Social Security death records dated February 2. 2012. and I will readthe testimony of the statement said: We will hear the heartbreaking story of one family whose 4yearold daughter had her identity stolen shortly after she passed away. Only when their tax return was rejected by the IRS did they learn that an identity thief had already filed a return claiming their child as a dependent. In an article regarding this terrible tragedy. it indicates that this little girl had fought for 33 months to fight brain cancer. The parents were overwhelmed with grief and medical bills. The mourning parents decided to file for a tax extension to get their paperwork in order. but within 24 hours of filing in October. the familys return was rejected. Someone had already fraudulently claimed their daughters Social Security number. My colleagues. I would ask that this amendment be considered because in actuality it deals with this very question. it provides more resources to address the question of protecting identity and the identity theft that occurs. My amendment. as I indicated. increases it by $100.000. As parents and grandparents. most of us may not know the pain these parents are feeling. but we can do something to make a necessary obligation easier for them to fulfill. The IRS operates a 1800 help line and provides tax assistance at no charge to tens of thousands of families who prepare their own taxes. The funds provided in this bill are intended to be used to allow training to assist the IRS to do a better job of meeting the needs of parents who have lost a dependent child during the tax year or prior to their filing of taxes. Just put ourselves in the shoes of this family whose little 4yearold fought for 33 months and in their distress. with all of these overwhelming bills. to come and find this dastardly act of someone stealing the childs ID. This amendment would address these cases where the Social Security number of a recently deceased child is stolen and is used by thieves to claim tax funds that should have gone to the family. Identity theft is a terrible crime that violates the privacy of victims. All of us. no matter what committees we are involved in. in the Judiciary Committee which I sit on. Homeland Security. we are grappling with the issues of privacy and identity theft. How many of us have had the impact of such. but it has not been as devastating. I would imagine. as the identity theft of your deceased child. The crime first came to the attention of several House committees in 2011. As I made note of. SAM JOHNSON. the chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee on the Ways and Means Committee. had this issue in 2012. They only need a Social Security number. a date of birth. and name of the child. This information would be found on medical records. school records. or other forms completed by parents in the course of registering a child for various activities. This is a crime. This is a shame. My amendment would give some comfort to help the IRS to help these parents. I ask my colleagues to approve this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130107022,Mr. Chairman. this is really a mean amendment to single out one city. one city that is hurting. to single out labor when. in fact. it is not labor. but it is the people that have those pension plans and now may not have a pension plan. to single them out. With all due respect to the gentlewoman. I am sure there have been many instances throughout history and in recent years when your area. your State. has been helped by Federal dollars when it was hurting. and we all got together and did that. be it a flood. be it a fire. be it a natural disaster. Whatever it may be. we came together to help. Detroit has its problems. and Detroit might have made some mistakes. But to single it out in an amendment and to say that we cannot help in any way. shape. or form is really mean. meanspirited and wrong. It may look good to single an urban center out. It may look good to single out a place that is hurting. But that is not the American way. The American way. I can tell you. as a New Yorker. when New York was hurting. people came to its aid. When we were attacked. we came to its aid. Sure. this is different. but Detroit. its hurting right now. And to single it out on this House floor at 10 minutes to 8. at this time. to single it out as not being worthy of Federal help. is really just wrong. And then to take the opportunity to attack organized labor by suggesting that somehow they are to blame and therefore they should not get any help is also meanspirited. So I have seen. in the time that I have been here. difficult amendments. But this one is one that really takes the cake. Mr. Chairman. Republicans have supported bailing out banks and financial institutions that were deemed too large to fail. We were all for saving the auto industry. and I was for it. too. We were all for making sure that big institutions did not fail. And while I questioned it. many of us went along with it. And here to single out Detroit at its worst moment when it is hurting like no city has hurt in a long time is just the wrong thing to do. If this is what the gentlewoman wants to do. I guess there is no way to stop her. but I would really wish that she would take a moment to think about this before she goes any further with this. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130126274,Mr. Speaker. I thank our ranking member for the time. First. let me mention a few of the good things in the Financial Services bill. We were able to substantially increase funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission by $150 million above last years level. We were also able to increase funding for the Community Development Financial Institutions fund and to authorize the CDFIs fund bond guarantee program for another year. We also increased robust funding for the SBA to help our Nations small businesses. and we added additional dollars to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. We removed numerous troubling riders that affected the Affordable Care Act. travel to Cuba. and the ability of the SEC to police our markets. Unfortunately. several problems remain in the bill. The bill would essentially repeal an important provision of DoddFrank to prevent banks from engaging in risky swaps activities backed by their depositors and ultimately by the Federal Government. The protections of DoddFrank were put in place to prevent a return to the risky transactions that led to the 2008 meltdown. We should not backtrack on those important reforms. I am also very concerned about the cuts made to the IRS which will force the agency to operate at levels below that of sequestration. This would cause a serious strain on the agency. There are several riders attached to the District of Columbia section of the bill. something that happens every year. Republicans have again limited the Districts ability to use their own dollars to provide abortion services. This bill also seeks to stop the District from implementing a recent ballot initiative that legalizes recreational use of marijuana. Thankfully. on this last provision. Republicans have simply missed the mark. The language of the rider only prevents the District from enacting laws. rules. or regulations regarding marijuana legalization. but it does not prevent already enacted efforts like the recent ballot initiative. The President recently took executive action to end everyday tragedies that occur when families are separated and people are deported. unfortunately. rather than using this as a chance to finally engage in reform. we are now doing something to the DHS by putting them on a CR.

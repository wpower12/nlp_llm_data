1140010178,Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to come before you to talk about and support H.R. 5. the Student Success Act. Mr. Speaker. this is legislation to replace No Child Left Behind. to restore local control over education. and to empower parents and local education leaders to hold schools accountable for effectively teaching students. I spent last week in my district. and I visited elementary and high schools. specifically schools that would be affected by the Student Success Act. These schools were located in some of the most impoverished areas of my district. I listened in classrooms. held forums to hear from parents and local education leaders. and spoke to teachers and administrators about the challenges they are facing. What I heard across the board was that the Federal Government and their compliance issues in the classroom are holding back our educators from effectively teaching our students. Topdown education mandates have failed to help students and have forced educators to waste valuable time and resources filling out paperwork and worrying about compliance with Federal requirements. Instead of this onesizefitsall approach. we need policies that enhance teachers abilities to focus on the individual needs of the students. We need bottomup reforms that give authority to the parents. teachers. and local education leaders. who work with their children and students every day and who know them best. H.R. 5 includes a number of conservative reforms to push back against the growing reach of the Federal Government into schools and to restore local control. It replaces the current national accountability system for school performance and replaces it with Stateled performance standards. It gets rid of more than 65 unnecessary or ineffective Federal education programs. repeals Federal requirements for teacher quality. and protects local and State autonomy over decisions in the classroom. H.R. 5 returns responsibility to parents. States. and local leaders to hold schools accountable instead of Washington bureaucrats. I saw that example work in a city that is in one of the most impoverished areas of my district. where parents actually lined up at 3:30 in the morning to enroll their students into theme schools. Each elementary school was broken up into a theme. The superintendent there had no idea that parental involvement would be that significant. I was there to witness the success of this theme school concept. I asked: Where did this idea come from? It did not come from Washington. It did not come from the Federal Government. It came from the creativity of the teachers and from the input of the parents and of the local administrators. Mr. Speaker. no one knows the needs of students better than the people who work and spend time with them every day. By empowering parents. teachers. and local education leaders. H.R. 5 takes strong steps forward in putting the control of education back in the right hands and in helping to provide every student with the opportunity to receive a good education. There is no debate today that every child deserves a good education. The debate is whether the Federal Government is in charge or whether we empower our local citizens to get the job done.
1140040011,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. the debate before this floor today is who knows best how to educate our children. I rise today to speak about H.R. 5. the Student Success Act. This is legislation that I believe goes a long way in getting the Federal Government out of the way of our schools and teachers and putting education back in the right hands by restoring local control. As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. I have spent several hours debating and marking up this legislation. I have also visited several schools in my district and have spoken with parents. teachers. and administrators about the challenges they are facing. What I heard across the board was that topdown regulations from Washington are burdening our teachers with seemingly endless compliance requirements. Our educators should have the ability to focus on the individual needs of their students and their classes. Instead. our current system is forcing them to spend time filling out paperwork and meeting this onesizefitsall requirement. That is exactly why H.R. 5 is important legislation that I urge my colleagues to support today. This bill replaces the current accountability system that says Washington knows what is best for our students. and it replaces it with a system that gives States and school districts the responsibility for measuring the success of their schools. Through bottomup reforms. it restores local control and gives our educators more freedom to innovate. I have personally seen in my district how students and communities benefit from local innovation in schools. We have one such example in my district that does not get $1 of Federal funding. and it takes children who are discarded by the public school system and makes successful students from this group. I am very proud of what this school has accomplished. H.R. 5 empowers parents. just like at this school. with more information to hold schools accountable for effective teaching. and it expands opportunities to send their children to a school that best meets their needs. It also gets rid of almost 70 unnecessary Federal programs and. instead. creates a block grant that provides money to the States.
1140086446,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota. Yesterday marked the deadline for all Americans to file their 2015 taxes. and Americans from all walks of life disclosed some of their most private information and handed over their hardearned dollars to the government. With this in mind. last week I was proud to introduce legislation prohibiting the use of funds by the IRS to target citizens for exercising their First Amendment rights. Americans have seen Federal agencies abuse their power. and the IRS is one of the worst offenders. The IRS has specifically targeted conservative groups simply for being conservative. This is a direct violation of the First Amendment. My bill preserves the integrity of the First Amendment by ensuring its protections are never compromised by unelected Federal bureaucrats. Specifically. H.R. 4903 protects Americans by prohibiting use of funds by the IRS and its rogue bureaucrats to carry out government abuse on citizens for exercising their constitutional rights. I can think of nothing more despicable than persecution for beliefs. Tax day is stressful enough with the Tax Code we have in place. The IRS has no business in striking fear into the hearts of Americans for expressing their strongly held beliefs and convictions. The Constitution is the law of the land. whether the IRS likes it or not. We must hold the IRS and its unelected bureaucrats accountable. especially because they have overstepped their constitutional bounds before. as my colleague pointed out. My colleague on the other side may dispute our legislation. but they cant dispute the facts. Mr. Speaker. My colleagues serving on the Oversight and Government Reform committee and the Ways and Means Committee have been investigating the IRS unlawful targeting of conservative groups since 2012. They were dogged in their pursuit of justice for every Americans fundamental right. the freedom of speech. The investigation revealed that. as a result of the Supreme Courts decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. democratic leadership pressured IRS bureaucrats to fix the problem by taking an aggressive stance against political speech by taxexempt entities. My colleagues also found clear evidence and testimony that the Tea Party and other conservative organizations were targeted for enhanced scrutiny because their organizations names reflected their conservative beliefs. For 27 months. from February 2010 until May 2012. the IRS systematically targeted conservative taxexempt applicants for additional scrutiny and delay. This is an egregious violation of the First Amendment rights of all Americans. The leader of this scheme was Lois Lerner. an IRS official at the time. as was mentioned. In April 2010. a sensitive case report on the targeted Tea Party groups is shared with Lerner. when she first learned of a spike in Tea Party applications. In June and July of 2011. Lerner is briefed that employees are using such terms as ""Tea Party."" ""patriots."" ""9/12 Project."" ""government spending."" ""government debt."" ""taxes."" and ""make America a better place to live"" to flag applications. Lerner. after learning about such terms. tells the Cincinnati office to revise its guidelines for flagging applications. The guidance is expanded to include ""organizations involved with political lobbying or advocacy for exemption under 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4)."" Also. Lois Lerners hard drive supposedly crashed that June. erasing 2 years worth of emails. How convenient was that? In March 2012. DARRELL ISSA. thenchairman of the Committee on House Oversight and Government Reform. expressed concern to the IRS inspector general that Tea Party groups were being targeted by the IRS. Doug Shulman. IRS Commissioner at the time. vehemently denied on the record to Congress that the agency was targeting conservative groups. In May 2013. Lois Lerner testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She proclaimed her innocence before invoking her Fifth Amendment right and refusing to answer questions from lawmakers. For 2 more years. the IRS circumvented Congress investigations. Lois Lerner. time and time again. refused to cooperate with Congress in its investigation of targeting conservative groups and. instead. hid behind the Fifth Amendment. Before I was elected to Congress. my colleagues in the House of Representatives rightly voted to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal to cooperate with ongoing investigations into the agencys special targeting of groups with ""Tea Party"" or ""patriot"" in their names that were seeking taxexempt status."

1130011028,"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I rise today. as they say. in opposition to the Progressive Caucus substitute. While my friends across the aisle are motivated by good intentions. I believe that their substitute is. frankly. a blueprint for fiscal disaster. Instead of restoring the certainty to the economy by promoting fairness and providing American families the opportunity for more prosperity. this budget is simply a black hole for American families. I can at least give credit to both the Progressive Caucus and the Democrat Caucus for offering a budget because the President of the United States has failed to do so. As you are aware. on February 4. the President. as required by law. is to give us a budget. Its March 20 now. and the American people. well. were still waiting. That is the fourth time in 5 years that President Obama has failed to submit a budget on time and failed to abide by the law. The Senate Democrats. well. theyre not much better. It has taken them almost 4 years to produce a budget that basically now increases government spending by $265 billion. taxes up by almost $1 trillion. and cuts health care providers by almost $300 billion. Over the period covered by the budget. deficits under the Senate plan are nearly $4 trillion larger than those under the House plan. So. today. we have a Progressive substitute on the floor. This budget will do what? It will raise taxes by almost $6 trillion over the next 10 years. including a new tax on carbon. $5.7 trillion in new taxes necessarily means greater tax burdens on who? The American family. These tax cuts put job creators in the penalty box again. and that means more Americans will be where? Without jobs. These tax policies are deceptively sold under. really. a warped notion of what ""fairness"" is. The reality is this ""fairness"" of theirs is merely a heavyhanded government taking from one pocket and putting in another pocket. This budgets tax policy is based on the equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity. When hes talking about equality. Milton Friedman once pointed out that a society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality. however. will get a high degree of both. So true fairness is the freedom to manage and direct ones own life and ones own future. Those who take risks giving their all in the pursuit of the American Dream deserve to keep what theyve earned. Those who work hard day in and day out. they deserve to keep what theyve earned. But the Progressive budget is nothing but regressive. Theres nothing fair about this budget. especially to the risktaker or to the hardworking American family. Their budget would spend nearly $9 trillion more than the Republican budget. Note. now. when I say those numberswhere does that money come fromthat means from our children and our grandchildren. They ultimately will be the ones who will have to bear this burden. This budget would also establish a governmentrun health insurance option under ObamaCare and let the government basically set price controls on drugs. What does that mean? That means for those who were around back in 1970s. I think thats most of us. price controls on gasoline. How did that work out for us? Not too long. Waiting lines for gas is one thing. Waiting lines. however. for lifesaving medicine is a whole other story. This budget would also expand the current. broken. and failed Federal jobtraining program without any reform whatsoever. This budget calls for even more money for the bureaucrats in Washington with regard to education. and this budget calls for even more money into the brokendown highway transit system that we have in this country. And this budget even fails in the governments first responsibilityproviding for the common defense. This budget further goes and guts the Defense Department by calling for almost $700 billion in cuts to the Pentagon compared to our budget. This Progressive substitute then would put this country basically on the wrong path. For that reason. I urge a ""no"" vote on this budget. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130022655,I thank the gentleman. I rise today obviously in support of H.R. 1062. the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. At a time when new regulation after new regulation is being proposed by this administration. it is critical that we restore some semblance of order to the regulatory process and ensure that our Nations small businesses do not continue to drown in a sea of red tape. So this legislation specifically subjects the SEC to a more robust version of the Presidents own order. which requires and outlines an enhanced costbenefit analysis requirement. as well as requires a review of existing regulations. The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act will do what? It will enhance the SECs existing economic analysis requirements for requiring the Commission to first identify the nature of the problem that would be addressed before issuing any new regulations. While the SEC has already certain costbenefit related requirements in current law relative to rulemaking. as indicated before. recent court decisions have vacated or remanded several of these and pointed out the deficiencies in the Commissions use of costbenefit analysis. For example. recently the SEC inspector general issued a report that expressed several concerns about the quality of their analysis. They found that none of the rulemaking examined attempted to quantify either benefits or costs. other than informational collection cost. This bill will ensure that the benefits of any rulemaking outweigh the cost. and that both new and existing regulations are accessible. consistent. written in plain language. and easy to understand. The legislation will also require the SEC to assess the cost and benefits of available regulatory alternatives. including the alternative of not regulating at all. and to choose the approach that basically gives us the best benefits. Under the bill. the SEC shall evaluate whether a proposed regulation is inconsistent. incompatible. or duplicative of other Federal regulations. as well. So because some rulemaking has been politicized in the past. the bill then requires this costbenefit analysis which I talk about will be performed by who? By the Commissions chief economist. These are commonsense reforms. They are appropriate. especially given the fact that the Commission continues to struggle with this issue. For instance. as already pointed out in the recent unanimous decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. which vacated the Commissions proxy access rule. the Court stated: The Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously for having failed once again adequately to assess the economic benefits of a new rule and inconsistently and opportunistically framed the costs and benefits of the rule. The bill also includes. besides all this. a section that will provide a clearer postimplementation assessment of new regulations so that postimplementation costbenefit analysis can also be done. in addition to the preimplementation. This will be able to better inform the true impact of the major rules once theyre in place. Now. some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say these new requirements will be too costly and will open the SEC to a flood of additional lawsuits. No. no. no. no. This could be further from the truth. By having these robust standards. the rules will be drafted so well that they will be thoroughly done. they will not be struck down by the courts. and we will not have to wade through additional time and money defending them in court and then redrafting the rules. like the proxy access rule. So in the end. this is a commonsense. pragmatic approach to our rulemaking process that should have been in place all along. And with our economy struggling now with unemployment above 71/2 percent. we need to ensure that were making it easier. not harder. for businesses to begin hiring again. Clearly. Mr. Chairman. a stronger commitment to economic analysis by the SEC is absolutely essential to ensure reasonable rules do not unduly burden registered companies or negatively impact job creation.
1130042180,"Mr. Chairman. it was my impression that this House had put an end to earmarks. and yet the TransportationHUD appropriations bill contains $125 million solely for the benefit of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. also known as WMATA. This is just a fraction. mind you. of the $1.5 billion that Congress intends to give the D.C. Metro system over a 10year period. This is not just your everyday average earmark. The Heritage Foundation has dubbed this subsidy ""the largest earmark in American history."" So I have an amendment here at the desk. and it is very simple. It simply eliminates this earmark that has received subsidies since 2008. At a time of record budget deficits and debt. the American people cannot afford to provide yet again another earmark. another special subsidy. especially when you take into consideration the fact that the D.C. Metro already receives funds from a variety of other Federal sources. from other Federal Transit Administration grants and programs. Also. you add to that. given the performance of this agency. I find it absolutely astounding that the American people should want to give even more of their hardearned cash to this agency. In addition to daily service interruptions. lax management. and poor general performance. Metro has a significant record of wasting money. Right here in The Washington Post. it was reported that Metro spent $382 million to rebuild cars. only to have them break down even more often than the cars that they didnt overhaul. The Post also pointed out that when senior agency attorneys wanted new offices for themselves. they spent over a quarter of a million dollars to accommodate them. And why not? Its simply our money. taxpayer money being used. Last year. it was reported that the Office of Inspector General uncovered several personal and unwarranted expenses on Metros credit cards. such as $2.000 worth of gift cards. things like camcorders valued at $730. and even $180 for headphones. So even when they spend this money on things it should be spending on. the facts are really disturbing. The Federal Government pays. mind you. over halfspecifically. 56 percentof their capital costs already. Now. I understand that well hear others who say. D.C.. the Nations Capital. its a tourist destination and it has a large population that utilizes it as transportation to get to work. but this is nothing unique. The same can be said for cities back in my neck of the woods like New York City or over in Chicago or Philadelphia. Boston. and Los Angeles. Should they get the same earmarks as well? What is it that is unique about Washington. D.C.. that they are the only ones that get this type of earmark? Congress should not be forced to make the taxpayers use their hardearned money to subsidize a transportation system that has failed over the years to get its fiscal house in order. We owe it to the American people to be better than that. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130047263,Mr. Speaker. prominently featured on the White House Web site. President Obama issued the following memorandum to all heads of executive departments and agencies: My administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency. public participation. and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in government. Unfortunately. despite once serving as the White House Chief of Staff. Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew apparently never got that memo. On June 7. shortly after the news broke that the Internal Revenue Service engaged in the reprehensible practice of targeting conservativeleaning political groups. I sent a letter to Secretary Lew with a handful of questions relating to his time served as White House chief of staff. Specifically I asked: First. when was the first time Secretary Lew. as chief of staff. became aware of the IRSs targeting of taxexempt groups. including rumors or media reports of targeting. independent of his knowledge of the IGs investigation? Second. given that IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman made numerous trips to the White House between October 2009 and December 2012. I asked Secretary Lew. again as chief of staff. if he attended any meetings with Shulman. Next I asked if anything was discussed relating to the IRS investigation concerning conservativeleaning organizations and their taxexempt status. Finally. I asked if Secretary Lew. as chief of staff. was involved in any or had any knowledge of rumors of conservative groups that were being targeted or of media reports highlighting the IG investigation relating to the targeting or any IRS personnel involved in potentially inappropriate targeting of conservative groups. Well. my letters went unanswered week after week after week. So I sent numerous emails and made phone calls to the Treasury Department. requesting a reply to my letter. Finally. finally a letter came. Unfortunately. rather than simply answering my questions and putting to bed any appearance of impropriety. Lew chose to not answer any of my direct questions. Now 31/2 months have passed since I asked those very simple and direct questions. I still cannot get an answer from him. So Im here today to encourage you to join me in the fight to get answers from Secretary Lew. You see. the Presidents memo was very clearhis government is to be the most transparent in the history of this great Nation. Well. then. we have to bring Secretary Lew up to speed on that memo. Jack Lew served as chief of staff to the President while some of the most egregious. reprehensible behavior ever displayed by the IRS took place. The American people have the right to know what he knows about the IRS scandal. when he knew it. and what involvement he had. as chief of staff. with personnel at the IRS. It is essential to the functioning of a representative government that the citizensthe voters who are representedhave confidence in the integrity of the system. If they dont. the government wont be trusted. Government must earn that trust. That means that the men and women who manage the daytoday affairs. such as him. must be trustworthy people. And to maintain that confidence. the publicthe men and the women must avoid even the appearance of impropriety. It is that principle that judges adhere to when they recuse themselves from cases where it may appear that they would have an interest in the outcome. The public must be assured that the outcomes generated by the men and women in Washington are not influenced by the conflicting interests. Otherwise. the systemwhether its corrupt or notwill have the taint of corruption. and thats just as bad. The President was right to emphasize transparency. and it is essential to the proper functioning of a representative government. Its up to the citizens and their representatives to demand that transparency and the propriety that it maintains. So again. I ask my colleagues and you. the American public. to join me in demanding the openness that President Obama promised. And to Secretary Lew. I am still waiting for those answers.
1130058720,"I thank the chairman. I think the compromise language we are considering today strikes the right balance. and I urge my colleagues to support that approach. and I thank the Members for working together to help us to get to this point. Mr. Speaker. those are not my words. Those are the words of the ranking member last year when similar language and similar legislation was coming down and she supported this legislation. So I want to associate myself with her support of this legislation. And why did she do so? Well. because she also said. The provision that we are talking about was something in the bill with section 716 that said ""the House Members were able to consider less carefully than other sections of DoddFrank. since the provision didnt come through under regular order in our Chamber."" In other words. she recognized the fact that this provision in the bill was added late in the dead of night and had never come through committee for consideration. She also realized. and I quote again. that ""legitimate concerns have been raised about whether pushing a significant portion of swaps out of banks is the best way to mitigate against future systemic risk."" So. again. I wish to associate myself with those words of the ranking member who. in the past. has supported the very same legislation that we have here before us today. And why do she and I both support this legislation? Because it is good for Main Street. It is good for farmers. It is good for small ranchers. It is good for small businesses. She recognized then. as I do now. that what we need to do is to try to spur on our economy. make sure that there are not impediments. that we dont overly complicate things in the banking sector. in the financial sector and what have youthat would do what? That would put our country at a competitive disadvantage with other countries around the world and. by so doing. make it harderyes. harderfor our farmers. ranchers. Main Street businesses. and the like to be able to get the credit they need and to pay their bills and what have you. So I concur with her that we need to pass this legislation today."
1130064610,I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. lets step back for a moment and just see where we may agree on certain points. I guess at the 30.000foot level we agree on the fact that we want to work together on legislation that will try to prevent the next financial crisis. We agree that we want to try to protect investors. It is after that level. however. when we get into the details that we disagree. As far as protecting and trying to make sure the next financial crisis does not occur. there has been no evidence either today on the floor or in the committee process during the discussion of this debate or in any of the debates when we discussed DoddFrank that the origin of the last financial crisis was from private equity. No evidence. Or from hedge funds. No evidence. Or from venture capital. No evidence whatever. So to say that we need to have extensive. overbearing. overlapping. extraneous regulation on private equity to prevent the next one. they have no evidence to say that was the cause in the past. We say. just as the gentleman from Connecticut said before. venture capital is excluded from it. Why not private equity as well? And that is why we have come together in a bipartisan manner to make sure the next crisis doesnt occur in an area such as this. In the second area. the point was made as far as the cost. The gentleman from Massachusetts said. Well. were talking about the larger funds here. If he was at the hearing last night in the Rules Committee. he would have heard one of his colleagues. Mr. POLIS from Colorado. refute that point. Why is that? This is what he said. When you are talking about firms. $150 million. $200 million sounds like large firms. right? But that is just how much money is under management. The actual money they are actually spending in the company is just a fraction of it. A little tiny fraction. as he pointed out. It is around 2 percent. So if you are talking about a $150 million fund under management. it sounds big. Actually. that is around a $3 million business. And now you are asking that $3 million business to have to pay upwards of half a million dollars each year for all their compliance costs and the examination. which goes to the last point by the gentlelady from New York.
1130085023,I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. let me begin by thanking the chairman of the Budget Committee. Chairman PAUL RYAN. and the Budget Committee staff as well for their hard work on H.R. 1872. the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act. As many have talked about before. our budget process in this country is broken. Simply put. we need to make the budget process more transparent. So the bill before the House today. the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act. is. as we like to say. a commonsense attempt to introduce more sunshine and common sense into our budget process. So what would this legislation do? Most importantly. the bill will require that the Federal Government apply something called fair value accounting. Now. that is the same credit accounting standards as the private sector uses when making or guaranteeing loans. So fair value accounting provides a more robust or more complete picture of the cost to the taxpayer of government loan programs or government lending programs. So fair value accounting accomplishes this how? By accounting for an additional marketrisk premium. Also. the bill recognizes the budgetary impact of governmentsponsored enterprises of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So this bill would then bring these wards of the taxpayer from out of the shadows and onto the budget. So why exactly do we need this specific piece of legislation here today? Well. without getting into the weeds too much. the simplest explanation is that there is no such thing in this country or in the world as a free lunch when it comes to a government program. The costs are always borne by someone. and in this case. it is borne by the American people. The facts indicate that not only is government costly. but also government costs more than we all initially expected. So the burden of government rarely comes in under budget. Nowhere does this ring truer than the Federal Housing Administration program. also called FHA. and their mortgage insurance. See. it defies common sense FHA. according to administrations Federal accounting rules. that they actually make money. they say. for the government. How do they do so? Well. it is only through the alchemy of government accounting can you transform a mortgage portfolio of figurative lead into gold and still remain true to the law. So this free money comes courtesy of what? It comes courtesy of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. This is the Federal accounting program and the standard that we operate today. Under FCRAs cooked accounting rules. the cost of Federal mortgage insurance is determined on the basis of a subsidy cost. including the risk that the borrowers default on a mortgage. and by using the Treasury rate. it does not account for market risk or overall systemic risk. So. what does that mean? Unlike fair value accounting. which appropriately incorporates a premium for market risk. the current law fails to reflect the true cost to the American taxpayer of these FHA mortgagebacked insurance. Let me give you an example. In the 2011 report. the nonpartisan CBO. the Congressional Budget Office. compared the cost of the current system of FHA of a singlefamily mortgage insurance on both the current law and what we have here. which is fair value basis. What did CBO find? Well. CBO estimated that. under the current accounting. FHA would actually raiseraise$4.4 billion for the government in 2012. Sounds pretty good. But if you actually dug into the numbers and use fair value basiswhich. as I said before. is what the private sector would be forced to dowith an appropriate accounting of market riskand of course. market risk is therethen what did CBO find? CBO then estimated that FHA would not gain $4.4 billion. but that FHA would actually lose $3.5 billion over the exact same period. Why is this? Because CBO believes that fair value provides a fuller picture of a programs budgetary impact. So it now employs fair value basis accounting as a standard procedure for Federal loan programs and Federal loan guarantee programs such as FHA. However. where is the problem? The problem is the Obama administration has strongly resisted the move to fair value accounting. and instead. they cling to the current program instead. Let me give you another example. In 2010. President Obama effectively nationalized the Federal student lending program. The President then immediately spent the savings. if you willremember. I talked about some of these beforeon his signature health care law. What is the problem? The problem is that there is a growing gap now between how much money was borrowed and backed by the U.S. taxpayerthat means you and Iand how much money is actually being repaid by the graduates. Let me give you some numbers. Based on the Department of Education data. there is a $99 billion gap between what has been borrowed and what has been paid back since only 2010. Remember. the President said these loans would actually make money for the Federal Government. Instead. the actual numbers are coming in that it is costing a $99 billion gap. So. the bill before us today. the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act. fixes these shortcomings by requiring that market risk to be explicitly included in estimates of Federal credit programs. What will that do? That will bring Federal budget practice in line with what has long been standard practice in the private sector. Specifically. it requires the executive branch and Congress to use fair value accounting in calculating the cost of Federal credit programs that consider not only the borrowing cost of the Federal Government. but also the cost of the market risk of the Federal Government in incurring or issuing any of these loans or loan guarantee programs. And so. with mounting debt and a lackluster job growth. it is time to force the government to play by the same economic rules as every single American family and business has to. It is not fair to keep putting the American taxpayer on the hook. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130085058,"Mr. Speaker. I will be brief. and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Just to set the record straight. actually. we did have hearings on this. and we did have markup hearings on this back in June of 2011. We dug into it at that period of time. The legislation. essentially the same. just in a different cycle. is. in essence. what we have before us today. so we have had that opportunity. But I will say this. If we see this legislation continue on the floor today and if we see this bill actually pass today. I extend to the gentleman and the members of the committeeor anyone on the other side of the aislethat my door is open to try to make changes to it that you see appropriate. to make it have the flexibility that you think is not in the bill. which I think is in this bill. and so on and so forth. So I stand ready to continue to work with you on it. But I think that after the hearings we have had and the importance of this legislation. now is the time to move forward. One last point on this. and I think the chairman of the committee made the point. but let me just reiterate this. At the end of the day. it does not add any additional costs to the American taxpayer. What this bill does is just make transparent the cost that is already there. I am trying to come up with a simple analogy. but fair value accounting is not necessarily one of the simplest things you can find an analogy for. but I guess it might be like this: You would not go to the store and just go through with your credit card swiping it along. buying the things that you need or think that you need not knowing what they actually cost as you leave the store. just putting them on your bill. knowing that at the end of the day. at the end of the month. you may get a statement. Knowing that you are going to have to pay for that bill. you wouldnt go to the store and do that any more than you should right now with the American public. put them. by using the taxpayers credit card for all these programs. worthwhile as they may. necessary as they may be. you shouldnt just be swiping that credit card not knowing exactly what the bottom line is. not knowing what the actual cost to the American taxpayer is. That is all this bill does is just give us that information. And with that information in hand. then we can come together. Republican and Democrat alike. on those areas that we all agree on are necessary for this country and necessary that we expend funds on. with that information in hand. and do it in a more prudent. efficient. and effective manner than we have been in the past where we have done without the information. With that. then. I urge a ""yes"" vote on this bill. and I yield back the balance of my time."
1130095914,Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer an amendment that stops the Justice Department from using one of the most dangerous and illogical legal theories of all times: the theory of disparate impact. In short. disparate impact liability allows the government to allege discrimination on the basis of race or other factors based solely on the statistical analysis that finds disproportionate results among different groups of people. In recent years. the Justice Department has increasingly used this dubious theory in lawsuits against mortgage lenders. insurers. and landlords. and forced these companies to pay multimillion dollar settlements. What is wrong with this. one might ask? Well. under disparate impact. one could never intentionally discriminate in any way. and even then have strong antidiscriminatory policies in place. and still be found to have discriminated. If. for example. a mortgage lender uses a completely objective standard to assess the credit risk. such as the debttoincome ratio. they can still be found to have discriminated if the data show different loan approval rates for different groups of consumers. Some of these statistical differences and outcomes may actually be due to discrimination. but others may not be. It is impossible to tell which is which from the statistics alone. Under disparate impact it doesnt matter though. All statistical differences are considered by themselves discrimination. To be clear. none of us have a tolerance for intentional discrimination. If there is intentional discrimination. we must prosecute it to the fullest extent of the law. The Justice Departments use of disparate impact. however. tries to fight one injustice with another. On a more practical level. disparate impact will make it difficult. if not impossible. for lenders to make rational economic decisions about risk. Lenders will feel the pressure to weaken their current standards to keep their lending statistics in line with whatever the Justice Department bureaucrats consider nondiscriminatory. We have seen what this discriminatory and damaging risky lending can do to our economy. It is truly reckless for our government to be encouraging those dangerous and shortsighted practices to continue. Ironically. disparate impact forces lenders. insurers. and landlords to constantly take race. ethnicity. gender. and other factors into account or risk running afoul of the Justice Department. You and I both know. Mr. Chairman. that even an accusation of discrimination could have a devastating impact on a small business. I quote Roger Clegg. who is the president and general counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity. He said: The disparate impact standard for antidiscrimination law pushes people to do one of two things: Get rid of legitimate selection criteria. or use a racial double standard to ensure that the numbers come out right. On balance. Mr. Chairman. disparate impact will make it more difficult and expensive for families to buy a home. and will result in more discrimination not less. For these reasons. both philosophical and practical. I ask my colleagues to reject this misguided theory by supporting my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.

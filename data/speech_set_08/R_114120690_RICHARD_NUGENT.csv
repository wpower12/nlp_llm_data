1140005354,Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentleman from Washington. Sheriff REICHERT. That is a term of endearment. It is won. a title that you earn. It is an opportunity to lead a great body of men and women. So when Sheriff REICHERT wanted to do this hour. it was. like he said. we have each others back. We have been through issues that we can relate to. When I first became a law enforcement officer. my mom said: You know. I could picture one of your brothers doing this. but not you. You just dont have that temperament to be that bold. I guess is what she was saying. compared to my brothers. But at the end of the day. after 39 years. and the last 10 as sheriff before I got elected to this office. those were 39 of the best years. and I guarantee it that DAVE REICHERT feels the same way with his tenure in law enforcement. I started out as a cop outside the city of Chicago and saw issues that I would rather not even mention. Coming down to Florida was quite a break. it was different. But at the same time. that changed over time too. From a small. sleepy sheriffs office of about 40 individuals to. when I left. we had over 500 folks that served this great Nation in that community. You hear a lot on the news about law enforcement in that they want to make it sound like we are not human. In reality. I have been to those scenes where a law enforcement officer has been involved in a shooting where he has had to take somebodys life. And that officer was so emotionally distraught. because that is not why they got into the business. It is not why I ever got into the business. You got into the business because you wanted to help people. you wanted to be there to protect people. That is what law enforcement is about. And. unfortunately. sometimes bad things happen to good people. Sheriff REICHERT mentioned the fact that sometimes police officers and deputies can make a mistake. We are only human. But when things are moving fast as the speed of light. you have got to think back as to what and why that officer did or didnt do what he did at the time. And I worry about when elected officials see it as a political expedience to condemn police officers for something that occurred before they ever get the facts. DAVE REICHERT and I sit on the floor and we talk about that. about maybe. just maybe people should wait until the investigation is complete before you condemn somebody. until you walk in their shoes. The sheriff talked about the fact that I can remember back as a rookie having to work. and I took the shifts of guys that had families because I wasnt married when it came down to holidays. I didnt have a family. so I would take the shifts so they could be with their families. But it didnt always work out that way. There was many a time that I missed Christmas. missed birthdays. missed wedding anniversaries because of service. and that is just not me. That is all the men and women that serve this country in local law enforcement and other law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. Most of the men and women that I served with. I guarantee you could go out and make more money doing something else. They were bright. bright people. But their calling was to be a law enforcement officer. To go out there in the dead of night. climb up in an atticremember thatyou climb up in an attic and you dont know what is up there. except you know there is a bad guy who is up there. and somebody has to go there and do it. At the end of the day. these men and women do it because they love the community they serve. Congressman REICHERT talked about what police officers do with their own money in regards to buying turkeys for Thanksgiving for families. buying Christmas presents for children that would not have a Christmas. doing summer camps for free for children because these children dont have or didnt have the ability to go to one of those paid summer campsthat is pretty neat. And we would. in our sheriffs office. without using taxpayer money. with donations from clubs like Kiwanis and Rotary and others. pay for that so that these young men and these girls and boys could have the opportunity to interact with law enforcement. to actually see that. do you know what? We are human. That when we do these little games out there in the field and we have the things. water balloons or whatever it may be. that we are real people. because a lot of times. the only time they see a law enforcement officer is possibly during a domestic situation where they are arresting their mom or their dad. And that can jade anybody. But it can also jade law enforcement. because the things that they see no one here would want to see. There were times when I went home. getting off the midnight shift. and walked in my house at 6 oclock in the morning. And what I had just seen the night before. you would have a hard time going to sleep. where you would grab your childI can remember my youngest child at the time. my only child at the timegrabbing him and hugging him because of what I just saw some other parent do to their child that was unspeakable. Our three sons. they all serve in the military. Our middle son is a Black Hawk pilot in the Florida Army National Guard. He is also a deputy sheriff in one of the major counties in Florida. He wasnt sure if that was the right job because. when they went through the class on child abuse. it struck a chord as a new dad: How could anyone do that to them? But do you know what? He has turned out to be a pretty good cop. And we say that with reverence. it is not a derogatory term. But the men and women that put on the uniform and that badge do it because they love people. not because they hate them. They do it because they really want to make a difference in their community. Their families are the ones that suffer the most. When I have had to go to scenes where I have had an officer killed in the line of duty. it breaks your heart. When I was a rookie officer outside of Chicago. right out of the academy. one of my academy mates was killed. shot and killed by a 12yearold in our first year on the job. You never know when it is going to hit. When Officer Kondek down in Tarpon Springs went to work on the 21st of December. he kissed his wife and his kids goodbye. expecting to be there for Christmas. Little did he know that that was the last day of his life. The person who killed him shot him and then ran him over with a car. This is not what we want. Where we want to see the America that I love is. the same respect that we give our soldiers returning from war. that we give that to our police officers. That when you see them in a restaurant or you see them on the street or you see them on a call. thank them for what they do. They will be absolutely surprised and amazed. but grateful. When my sons are in uniform and people come up to them in the military and thank them for their service. there is no reason we cant do the same for our law enforcement officers. Congressman REICHERT is probably the most humble guy I know in the stories. and he would never brag about himself. but he is a consummate professional. His bravery is unmatched. and his leadership. I am sure. at that sheriffs office in Washington State is better for him being sheriff than not.
1140024706,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. today I rise in support of H.R. 723. the Fallen Heroes Flag Act. The bill before us would allow Members of Congress to honor a firefighter. law enforcement officer. member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew. or public safety officer who died in the line of duty by providing the family of the deceased individual. at their request. a United States flag flown over this Capitol. Our Nations flag would be accompanied by a certificate containing an expression of sympathy for the family of the individual who passed away. signed by both the Speaker of the House and the individuals Representative here in Congress. This measure. authored by the distinguished gentleman from New York allows our House to express its gratitude and recognition for an individual who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of public service to this great country. Many in our country put their lives on the line every day to serve others. They are the firefighters who charge into burning buildings in order to save life or property. they are the police officers and other law enforcement officers who respond to incidents and through their actions shield others from harm. they are the members of rescue squads or ambulance crews who spend countless hours perfecting lifesaving skills and rush to the scene of a disaster. and they are the public safety officers who work to patrol our roads. man the dispatch communication lines. and work within our justice system to accomplish countless other safety services for our communities. Our Nation is exceedingly blessed to have individuals who answer the call to dedicate their lives serving others. We are very grateful to be surrounded by individuals who work hard each day to save and protect lives. Each swore an oath to uphold our laws. and each sacrifices safety in the defense of others. These individuals are our daily heroes. The rescue workers and law enforcement officers are our sons and daughters. they are our mothers and fathers. they are our sisters and brothers who each day rise up and stand in the defense of others. And in some cases. these heroes pay the ultimate sacrifice. and they are killed in the line of duty. just as we heard earlier. It is a tragedy in the truest sense of the word when one of these extraordinarily fine individuals loses their life. most especially while in the act of saving the life of another. I stand here. Mr. Speaker. not just as a Member representing my congressional district but also as someone who knows firsthand the sacrifices that these men and women put forward to serve their communities. Before I came to Congress. I served my community as a police officer. as a deputy sheriff. and eventually as a sheriff in a county in Florida. I know what it means for so many men and women to come to work every day not knowingyou can never predict the events of the day and what those events may hold for you. But one thing is certain: you will answer the call for help with everything you have got. When you kiss your wife or husband goodbye or your children goodbye. when you start your shift. they want to know you are going to come home. But they also know that the realities of life are it is possible that you may make the ultimate sacrifice for your community. So. Mr. Speaker. it is appropriate that we recognize their selfless efforts of sacrifice and offer this meaningful token as an expression of our Nations gratitude. It is an honor to stand here today in support of this legislation. Each Member of Congress should have the ability to recognize these brave individuals for their heroism and to extend a gesture of sympathy and gratitude to their immediate families. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140024711,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. it is a proud day. Mr. BOYLE. I do appreciate your comments in regard to those who serve us. Mr. KING. I think your reputation precedes you in regard to caring about those who care for us every day. It is a thankless job a lot of times to be a fireman or a police officer or an EMT. Those folks go to work because they want to help people. They dont go to work because they want to hurt someone. They are driven by this desire to do right and to do good every day. It is really easy sometimes. I think. that we forget that these are men and women who. whether they wear the badge of a law enforcement officer or a firefighter or an EMT or any other public safety officer. do their job because they are committed to their community. They do it because they love their community. So when some folks want to rush to judgment. I would just suggest that until you walk in their shoes. until you know what it is like to serve in that capacity. I would ask that people use a little restraint and maybe wait until investigation is complete before we start making decisions in regards to guilt or innocence. I had to do that as sheriff. I had deputies who were involved in fire fights where other folks were killed. But you wanted to make sure thatlisten. we want to know the facts. We want to know the truth. And if a police officer does something that is wrong. then he should be dealt with. But not all police officers do things wrong. They are human beings. and sometimes they do make mistakes. Mr. Speaker. this particular bill talks to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. no matter how they served this great country. whether it was in the fire service or the law enforcement service or public safety in any manner. This is about recognizing them and their families for their service. These first responders and public safety officers stand side by side with each other supporting each other in a common goal. Whether you are a fireman or a police officer. it is a common goal to do the right thing. They and their families live with these risks. They know what the job brings. the risks that are incurred. but they do that selflessly. Every time they put on that uniform to go to work. they do it knowing that something bad could happen to them that could change the lives of their children and their families forever. Mr. Speaker. this bill allows us in Congress to offer a simple yet meaningful expression. I believe. of sympathy. We cant make up the familys loss to them. but we can remember these fallen heroes. and we can offer their families our gratitude as we honor those loved ones memories. as I think this body should do every day because there are folks that stand the line for us. whether it is fighting a fire. rescuing us from a trapped vehicle at a scene of horrific destruction. whether it is tornadoes or earthquakes. law enforcement officers have to go places that no other folks want to go. I just thank you. Mr. KING. for bringing this bill forward. I want to thank my good friend on the other side of the aisle. Mr. BOYLE. for standing for what is right. and I appreciate that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140030141,Mr. Chairman. each day more and more Americans are realizing that we need to take action to deal with mental health issues in this country. We need to make it a priority. My amendment. in keeping with that sentiment. would provide additional funding for programs under the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act and for Veterans Treatment Courts. These are programs with proven track records of effectively addressing some of the important issues associated with mental health illnesses. My amendment would offset this increase by taking $4 million from the periodic censuses and programs account. Mr. Chairman. both of the programs that would receive an increase in funding under my amendment highlight the need for our justice and mental health systems to work together. As a former sheriff. I can tell you that cooperation is vital. If our justice and mental health systems are collaborating. we can provide more positive outcomes not only for those with mental health illnesses. but for our taxpayers as well. Grants provided under MIOTCRA are used. among other purposes. to set up mental health courts. for community reentry services. and for training State and local law enforcement officers to help identify and deescalate mental health crises. which saves the lives of both the mentally ill and of the responding officers. During my 37 years as a cop. I saw firsthand how our jails were becoming warehouses for people with mental health needs. No one is well served by this process. not those with mental illness. not our taxpayers. and. certainly. as I spoke earlier. not our veterans. Let me provide you with some numbers to illustrate what actually is going on within our jails. According to the Florida Mental Health Institute. over a 5year period. 97 individuals from MiamiDade County accounted for 2.200 bookings in the county jail. 27.000 days in the jail. and 13.000 days in crisis units. State hospitals. and emergency rooms. The cost to the State and to local taxpayers was nearly $13 million for just 97 people. However. the type of programs my amendment supports have been shown to dramatically reduce those rates. In Pinellas County. for instance. which is another Florida county. a mental health jail diversion program showed an 87 percent reduction in rearrests for the nearly 3.000 offenders who were enrolled. Not only does my amendment support these programs. but it also recognizes the unique responsibility that we have to our veterans. Veterans are disproportionately affected by mental health illnesses. Even more. they would likely not have these issues if it werent for their service to this country. We owe them a better outcome. and Veterans Treatment Courts can help. My point is that they are some of the best investments we can make. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140090080,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his support. We in law enforcementand I still say ""we in law enforcement""- do appreciate it any time Congress reaches out and does something positive for our law enforcement families. even though it is after the fact. This is one of those times where. as sheriff. I had to preside over inthelineofduty deaths. As a rookie police officer outside of Chicago. my first year on the job. one of the guys that I went to the academy with was shot and killed. I moved to Florida and became a deputy sheriff and rose up the ranks to sheriff. One of the things that I always worried about as a father and as a husband was: What am I leaving to my family? How are they going to be taken care of in the future? And what is going on in this country today in regards to belittling law enforcement? Trust me. we make mistakes. and I think that reasonable people understand that. but when you condemn a whole profession. it is unconscionable. I think this is the type of thing that we need to do. I do appreciate this is very bipartisan in nature and that it is really lifting up all of our first responders. We think back to 9111. when those firemen and police officers rushed into the Twin Towers and those that lost their lives as others were leaving the towers toward safety. They did the unthinkable. and that is to rush into a burning building. Or they rush in somewhere where they know there is an armed intruder. They do it on a daily basis. They dont ask for much. but we as Members of Congress really stand up for them and their families by this simple act. This is not a huge. huge thing. but I will tell you what. to a grieving family. it is a small token of the appreciation that the United States of America. this Congress and the Senate. can bestow on a family in their deepest sorrow. It is not going to bring back their loved one. but I will tell you. they are going to look at that flag and remember the fallen and how great a person they were. So it is not just what we do today. it is really about what has happened. The gentleman from New Jersey talked about the Senate. and Mr. KING. from this House. from New York. moved this legislation through. It has been a pleasure to stand here today. to come here today and talk for all those who cant talk for themselves. they cant speak for themselves. My 38 years in law enforcement was probably the best time of my life because I was actually doing something and protecting people on a regular basis. I cant think of a greater honor than to fly a flag of this Nation over this Capitol and give that to the grieving family of a fallen first responder. Mr. Speaker. knowing that this institution is behind them. so stand the American people. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140091429,I thank Sheriff REICHERT so very much for yielding. Mr. Speaker. we are here at a very solemn time in the law enforcement community. National Police Week is the week that we honor those who have fallen the year before and in all of the prior years. When Sheriff REICHERT was talking about the statistics of assaults on law enforcement officers and about the number of law enforcement officers who are killed annually. behind each of those stories is a real persona son or a daughter who is not coming home anymore. or a wife or a husband. I have been a police officer. I was a police officer for 38 years. and I was ultimately a sheriff in Hernando County. Florida. I have buried my share of fellow law enforcement officers in those 38 yearstoo many to even talk about without bringing a tear. I can tell you. as a rookie police officer who was right out of the academy. in the first year I was on the street. one of the guys with whom I went through the academy was shot and killed. That was the first year out of the academy. I was held hostage at one point in time in my career by a guy who was intent on killing his wife. We all have stories like that. Sheriff REICHERT is one of those true heroes in law enforcement. He is too modest to talk about the times that he has been assaulted. stabbed. or of the folks he has put in jailthe Green River Murderer. That is just the type of people we are. We are very humble. I was blessed to be in law enforcement for 38 years. and 12 of those years were outside the city of Chicago. I will tell you this: the brotherhood in law enforcement is the same wherever you go across this great Nation. We are made up of people. though. and we have flaws like anybody else. Whether you are a physician or a teacher or even a priest. sometimes they do wrong things. but 99.99 percent of those in law enforcement do it for all of the right reasons. It is not because they are going to make great pay. and it is not because: Oh. my gosh. I get to work the weekends or work holidays or work midnights or miss birthday parties. They do it because of the love that they have for the people whom they serve in whatever community it may beas large as New York City and as small as Apopka. Florida. It doesnt matter. The feelings that go into being a law enforcement officer are those of service to his fellow man. I have been blessed. My wife and I have been married for 41 years. with three sonsall of them in the militarybut the one middle son. who is a Blackhawk pilot for the Florida Army National Guard. is also a deputy sheriff in Hillsborough County. Florida. I know the feeling that his wife has every time he dons that uniform and goes to work: Is he going to come home tonight? That is the feeling that all of our wives and mothers and grandmothers felt for their children as they went out the door wearing that uniform of whatever city. county. township they supported or State police agency. We have been blessed in America. and it is because of those peoplethat thin blue linewho are willing to stand in front of danger to protect the normal. average citizen. somebody they have never met and may never meet again. They run into burning buildings. just like on 9111. to save people. They face down felons to save their fellow man. All they ask for is a little respect. and I dont think that is too much to ask. This week we passed a piece of legislation. the Fallen Heroes Flag Act. that allows us as Members of Congress and in the Senate to provide a flag. It is a small token of our everlasting appreciation for the sacrifices their families have made in the deaths of loved ones who served their country while wearing a law enforcement officers uniform. We passed that here. and the President is going to sign it. It gives us the ability to provide that flag at no cost to the families. Go figure. At the end of the day. it is really about recognizing in a very small and symbolic way that it does matter. Blue lives matter. and all lives should matter. Mr. Speaker. I thank the distinguished sheriff. the gentleman from Washington State. DAVE REICHERT.

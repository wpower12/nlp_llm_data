1140006763,Mr. Speaker. amidst all the controversies gripping Congress. certainly. we should all be able to agree that the full faith and credit of the United States should not hang in the balance every time there is a fiscal debate in Washington. This Nation now staggers under $18 trillion of debt. nearly $7.5 trillion of it run up during this administration. The interest on that debt is one of the fastest growing components of the Federal budget. If there is ever any doubt of the security or reliability of that debt owed by this government. interest rates would quickly rise. and our precarious budget situation could rapidly spin out of control. Ernest Hemingway put it this way. He asked: How do you go bankrupt? Two ways. First gradually. then suddenly. So it is with nations. The debt limit is how we regulate the Nations debt. It is the national equivalent of a credit card limit. That limit has to be periodically adjusted. It is appropriate for Congress to take responsibility when it is raised. When it is raised. it is also appropriate for Congress to review and revise the policies that are driving that debt. The fundamental problem under both Democratic and Republican Congresses is that this process is fraught with controversythe bigger the debt. the bigger the controversy. the bigger the controversy. the more credit markets are likely to be spooked into demanding higher interest payments to meet their greater risk. Given the size of our debt. that could produce an interest tidal wave that could sink our budget and our Nation along with it. I am. today. introducing the Default Prevention Act with 43 cosponsors to guarantee that the sovereign debt of the United States Government will be paid in full and on time. under any circumstances. even total political gridlock. It simply provides that if the debt limit is reached. the Treasury Secretary may continue to borrow above that limit for the sole purpose of paying interest and principal that is due. It is an absolute guarantee that the debt of the United States will be honored. Most States have various laws to guarantee payment of their debts. Three years ago. in testimony to the Senate. Ben Bernanke praised these State provisions for maintaining confidence in their bonds. This act passed the House in the 113th Congress. but it was never taken up by the Senate. Now. we are approaching the expiration of the governments current borrowing authority. We will soon have serious discussions over the level of our debt and the additional measures necessary to bring that debt under control. We all hope these discussions will go smoothly. but we all know that sometimes they dont. The Default Prevention Act says loudly and clearly to the world that no matter how much we may differ and quarrel. the sovereign debt of this Nation is guaranteed. and their loans to this government are absolutely safe. Last session. the Democrats opposed this measure. charging that it is an excuse not to pay our other bills. Do they actually suggest that all these other Statesthat have guaranteed their sovereign debts for generations. some for centurieshave ever used these guarantees as an excuse not to pay their other bills? On the contraryby providing clear and unambiguous mandates to protect their credit first. they actually support and maintain their ability to pay for all of their other obligations. The most outrageous claim the Democrats made was that this measure paid China first. What nonsense. More than half of our debt is held by Americans. often in American pension funds. This act actually protects Americans far more than Chinese or other foreign investors. Whether our loans come from China or Timbuktu. from Grandmas pension fund or Johnnys savings bond. without the Nations credit. we cannot meet any of our other obligations. Principled disputes over how the debt limit is addressed are going to happen from time to time. Just a few years ago. thenSenator Barack Obama vigorously opposed an increase in the debt limit sought by the Bush administration. When these controversies erupt. as they inevitably do in a free society. it is imperative that credit markets are supremely confident that their loans to the United States are secure. Providing such a guarantee could prevent a future debt crisis and give Congress the calm it needs to negotiate the changes that must be made to bring our debt under control before Congress authorizes still more debt. I urge its speedy consideration.
1140022260,Mr. Chairman. this amendment continues the effort to stop or. at least in this case. to freeze appropriations that are made for agencies whose legal authorizations lapsed many years and even decades ago. Ever since 1835. the rules of the House have forbidden spending any money for purposes unauthorized by current law. yet today. about onethird of our discretionary spending is for unauthorized programs. Why is that? Well. it is because the rule against unauthorized spending cannot be enforced because it is always waived by the resolutions that bring these bills to the floor. The bill before us today contains $25 billion in unauthorized spending for programs that have not been reviewed by the authorizing committees since as far back as 1980. Jimmy Carters last year in office. I am sure that someeven manyof these programs are valuable and worthy of taxpayer dollars. but surely others are not. The fact that they have not been authorized in as many as 35 years ought to warn us to at least be a little more careful in continuing to fund them. Rather than review our spending decisions and making tough choices about spending priorities. Congress simply rubberstamps these programs out of habit. year after year. It is no wonder we are so deeply in debt with so little to show for it. My amendment does not defund these unauthorized programs. as the House rules require. It simply freezes spending on them at last years level. The cuts contained in this amendment total $129 million. or about thirtysix onehundredths of 1 percent of the total spending in this bill. This House has a responsibility to examine these programs. reauthorize the ones that work. and modify or end the ones that dont. It has a responsibility. but it has no incentive. as long as we keep funding them and. worse. increasing the funding that these programs receive. In a sense. this is a token. It is a symbol. Reducing this bill by thirtysix onehundredths of 1 percent will have no appreciable effect on the $35.5 million in this appropriation or the $3.8 trillion the Federal Government plans to spend this year. but I hope that it will send a subtle but clear message that the Members of this House insist that the Congress reassert its constitutional responsibility to authorize Federal spending and to enforce its own rules that prohibit spending blindly on unauthorized programs. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140022665,"Mr. Speaker. it is said that. when the plan for the ancient city of Alexandria was presented to the great Alexander. his master builder pointed with pride to an ingenious way to honor the citys namesake. All of the citys water supply would be channeled to one great central fountain featuring a giant statue of Alexander and then flow from it to the surrounding city. When Alexander seemed unimpressed. his architect explained the symbolism. Water. the lifes blood of the city. would flow from Alexander to Alexandria. Alexander replied. ""But water is not the lifes blood of a city. Commerce is the lifes blood of a city."" The statue of Alexander was placed. instead. at the entrance to the port. As it is with citystates. it is with nationstates. Every nation that engages in trade prospers from it. every nation that fails to trade. fails to prosper. Today. international trade agreements are the means by which nations establish the terms of their commerce. This often requires intricate negotiations with trading partners. and our trading partners must be confident that the United States is bargaining in good faith and that what is decided at the bargaining table will not be revoked or redefined later at a congressional table. The Constitution gives Congress the authority to regulate commerce with other nations. Congress. thus. has the final say over any trade agreement. but trading partners have to have confidence that. once the agreement has been reached. it represents the last best offer of both sides. a meeting of the minds that wont be repeatedly altered after the fact. That is why. since the 1930s. Congress has chosen to exercise its responsibility by establishing the broad terms of the agreement that it seeks and then giving explicit instructions to our negotiators at the beginning of the process. Ifand only ifthese objectives are advanced in the agreement. Congress will then consider it as a whole package and either approve it or reject it. That process is called trade promotion authority. It stood the test of time. It has been used to the great benefit of our Nation in the past and has never been controversial until now. From the left. opposition comes from protectionist special interests. They fail to learn from the painful lessons of history. Protectionism is the fastest way to destroy an economy. as this Nation has learned repeatedly. including during the Jefferson administration and. again. in the Hoover administration. From the right. opposition comes from a mistrust of this Presidents judgment and competence. a mistrust I completely and unequivocally share. It is precisely because of this mistrust that the trade promotion authority sets forth some 150 objectives that must be advanced before Congress will even consider the resulting agreement. Once those objectives are attained. a majority of the Congress must still approve it. This measure does not empower the President to do his own thing. it binds the President to faithfully execute the will of Congress. Trade promotion authority simply continues a timeproven process through which Congress exercises its authority to regulate commerce at the beginning of negotiations so trading partners can have a reasonable expectation that their painstaking negotiations. compromises. and concessions wont be ripped asunder and reopened when Congress acts. Indeed. the successful Base Closure and Realignment Commission process worked on exactly the same principle. Let me repeat. this gives the President no new authority. It binds him to Congress will at the outset of negotiations and promises only that. if the objectives set by Congress are advanced. will the Congress agree. not necessarily to approve the agreement. but simply to vote on it without opening new issues or causing unnecessary delays. The statue at one of our greatest ports is not of a person. but of an ideal. liberty. It is freedom that produces prosperity. the free exchange of goods between people for their mutual bettermentthe greater the freedom. the greater the prosperity. Trade promotion authority is the means by which this freedom is advanced among nations. Mr. Speaker. freedom works. It is time that we put it back to work."
1140023431,Mr. Chairman. hydrologists tell us that California is facing the worst drought in 1.200 years. With the rain season officially over. our snowpack is just 3 percent of normal. and many reservoirs are already drawn down perilously. Californians are now threatened with draconian fines if they take too long in the shower. This amendment forbids the Bureau of Reclamation from purchasing scarce water in California in the midst of this catastrophic drought for the purpose of dumping it in rivers to adjust the water temperature to nudge baby fish to swim into the ocean. As ridiculous as this sounds. that is exactly what the Bureau of Reclamation has been doing throughout this drought. It is using money taken from families taxes in order to purchase water that is desperately needed by these same families and then literally dumping it down the drain in front of them. This exacerbates an already perilous scarcity of water while forcing the price of our remaining supplies even higher. It also makes a mockery of the sacrifices that every Californian is making to stretch every drop of water in their homes. And it undermines the moral authority of the government to demand further conservation from the people when it is squandering water so outrageously itself. We dont know exactly how much the Bureau is spending for this purpose because they dont account for how their purchased water is used. This measure would forbid them from wasting any of our water on such frivolities as adjusting water temperatures. Now if this sounds harsh for the fish. lets remember that in a drought like this one. there would be no water in our rivers. There would be no fish. The dams make it possible to save the water from wet years so that we can get through the dry years. That doesnt work if we open floodgates in an extreme drought like this to make the fish happy. This month. the Bureau of Reclamation released nearly 30.000 acrefeet of water from the New Melones Dam in my district for that purpose. That is enough water to meet the annual residential needs of a population of nearly 300.000 human beings for the express purpose of encouraging the offspring of some 29 steelhead trout to swim toward the oceanwhich. by the way. they tend to do anyway. And to add insult to injury. almost all of these smolts will be eaten by predators before they reach the ocean. So let me put this again and quite bluntly. In order to benefit a handful of steelhead trout. the Bureau sacrificed enough water to meet the annual needs of a human population of 300.000. At $700 per acrefoot. the cost of this exercise amounted to $21 million. This is the lunacy of the environmental left and the policies they have imposed on our State and our country. It needs to stop now. And to the extent that we can do so through the power of the purse. we must. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140031604,"Madam Chair. this amendment eliminates the $155 million of discretionary spending that is wasted on one of the least essential programs in the entire United States Government. the socalled Essential Air Service. That is the program that subsidizes empty and nearempty planes to fly from small airports to regional hubs just a few hours or less away by car. This was supposed to be a temporary program to allow local communities and airports to readjust to airline deregulation in 1978. Not only is it still going on today. but it has doubled in cost in the last 4 years. from $130 million in 2011 to roughly $260 million in 2015. and $155 million of that is in our control. This amendment zeros it out and puts it toward deficit reduction. Now. we are often told: Well. dont worry. We have enacted all of these reforms. We have caps on subsidies. All those caps. $200 per ticket. are only for flights under 210 miles. It continues unlimited subsidies over that distance. Actual subsidies per passenger can be as high as $980 per ticket. paid by hardworking taxpayers. Year after year. we are promised reform. and year after year. the cost goes up and up. By the way. Essential Air Service flights are flown out of Merced and Visalia airports. serving my district in the Sierra. Trust me. a tiny number of people actually use it. The alternative is hardly catastrophic. it is typically an extra hours drive to a regional airport. I guarantee you that everybody who hears about this waste of their money is outraged by it. It is true there are a few tiny communities in Alaska. like Kakes 700 citizens. that have no highway connections to hub airports. but they have plenty of alternatives. In the case of Kake. they enjoy yearround ferry service to Juneau. In addition. Alaska is well served by a thriving general aviation market and the ubiquitous bush pilot. Rural life has great advantages. It also has some disadvantages. but it is not the job of hardworking taxpayers who choose to live elsewhere to level out the differences. Now. apologists for this wasteful spending tell us it is an important economic driver for these small airports and airlines. and I am sure that is so. Whenever you give away money. the folks you are giving it to are always better off. but the folks you are taking it from are always worse off to exactly the same extent. Indeed. its economic drivers like this that have driven Europes economy right off a cliff. Two years ago. one Member rushed to the microphone to suggest that this was essential for emergency medical evacuations. It has nothing to do with that. This program subsidizes regularly scheduled commercial service that practically nobody uses. If it actually had a passenger base. it wouldnt need. in effect. to hand out $100 bills to the few passengers who use it. An airline so reckless with its funds would quickly bankrupt itself. Well. the same principle holds true of governments. The Washington Post is not known as a bastion of fiscal conservatism. but I cannot improve upon an editorial a few years ago when it said. ""Ideally. EAS would be zeroed out. and the $200 million we waste on it devoted to a truly national purpose: perhaps deficit reduction. military readiness. or the social safety net."" The Washington Post goes on to write. ""Alas. if Congress and the White House were capable of making such choices. we probably never would have had sequestration in the first place."" Madam Chair. there are many tough calls in setting fiscal priorities. but this isnt one of them. If the House of Representativeswhere all appropriations begin. where the Republican majority pledged to stop wasting moneycant even agree to cut this useless program off from the trough. how does it expect to be taken seriously on the much tougher choices that lie ahead? I reserve the balance of my time."
1140034056,"Mr. Chairman. this amendment forbids scarce defense dollars from being allocated to fund three executive orders and several other provisions of law that require our military to squander billions of dollars in socalled green energy. The House adopted this amendment by a voice vote last year. I would again remind the House that. just a few weeks ago. the socalled defense hawks warned that our defense budget has been strangled by sequestration. that every dollar wasted long ago had been wrung out of the Pentagon budget. and that our national security was directly imperiled as a result. That argument carried the day. even though it will add billions of dollars to the national debt. yet. although we were told we didnt have enough money to adequately pay and supply troops in the field. it seems that we do have plenty of defense money to indulge the ""green energy"" mandates that are imposed on our Armed Forces. What truly troubles me is that this was all aired during debate on the DOD Appropriations bill last year. The limiting amendments were adopted by voice vote. yet we see the same waste being allowed in this years bill. Let me refresh memories about the green energy mandates. The GAO reports that these mandates have cost the Navy as much as $150 per gallon for jet fuel. In 2012. the Navy was forced to purchase 450.000 gallons of biofuel for its socalled green fleet at the cost of $26.60 per gallon. when conventional petroleum cost just $2.50 per gallon. These mandates forced the Air Force to pay $59 per gallon for 11.000 gallons of biofuel in 2012. That is 10 times more than regular jet fuel costs. It is not just biofuels. Last year. the Pentagon was required to purchase over 1.000 Chevy Volts at a subsidized price of $40.000 each. As Senator Coburns office pointed out: ""Each one of these $40.000 Chevy Volts represents the choice not to provide an entire infantry platoon with all new rifles or 50.000 rounds of ammunition that cannot be used for realistic training."" These green energy mandates have required the Army and Navy to install solar arrays at various facilities. At Naval Station Norfolk. for example. the Navy spent $21 million to install a 10acre solar array which will supply a grand total of 2 percent of the base electricity. According to the inspector generals office. this project will save enough money to pay for itself in just 447 years. It is too bad solar panels only last about 25 years. We dont know exactly how much these mandates waste because. as the GAO reports: ""There is currently no comprehensive inventory of which Federal agencies are implementing renewable energyrelated initiatives and the types of initiatives they are implementing."" Outside estimates are as much as $7 billion for the Department of Defense last year. a figure that is expected to grow in the future. We are told this program is necessary for flexibility. Really? Shouldnt ""flexibility"" free us to get cheaper and more plentiful fuels. not more expensive and more exotic ones? We are told the military should do its part for the environment as if it is possible to fight an environmentally sensitive war. That. I fear. is the real reason for this wasteful spending. to sacrifice our military budget on the altar of climate change. This is part of an ideological crusade imposed on our military that will pointlessly consume billions of defense dollars mainly to keep money flowing to politically wellconnected ""green energy"" companies that cant get anyone else to buy their products. There is a reason that Admiral Mullen warned us that. in his professional military judgment. the greatest threat to our national security is our national debt. We just increased that debt because of assurances that we had stretched the defense budget to the breaking point. As long as this program continues to consume billions of our defense dollars. that claim cannot be taken seriously. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140042601,"Mr. Speaker. I dont know how adequately to express my alarm and outrage over the Presidents agreement with Iran. It is a breathtakingly dangerous act. Some have compared it to Neville Chamberlains Munich accord with Nazi Germany. but that does not fully illustrate the danger. In this case. we are talking about a rogue state with all of Nazi Germanys genocidal intentions. but this one will be armed with nuclear weapons. In its preamble. the agreement asserts that Iran will comply with the nuclear nonproliferation treaty that it signed long ago. Well. wait a second. If it had obeyed this treaty. we wouldnt be having this discussion to begin with now. would we? The fact is that Iran has a wellestablished and consistent record of routinely violating international law. Its intention to acquire nuclear weapons is obvious. The immediate effect of the Presidents action is to release hundreds of billions of dollars of direct and indirect resources to Iran with which its government can pursue its military and terrorist activities. activities that arent even addressed in this agreement. It is sobering to consider that Irans extensive terrorist operations. which reportedly now reach into South America. are about to get a huge infusion of cash. But lifting the sanctions does far more damage than merely releasing resources to this outlaw regime with which to kill Israelis and Americans. as its leader vowed to do just last week. The sanctions were having a major impact on destabilizing the regime according to all of the Iranian expatriates I have talked with. Relieving those sanctions undermines what had been a rapidly building uprise against the regime from within. Over the last several years. the Iranian opposition had grown dramatically for two reasons: there was a strong and growing perception among the Iranian people that the Iranian dictatorship was a pariah in the international community. and that the resulting international economic sanctions had created conditions that make the regimes overthrow imperativethat is. until Barack Obama blundered onto the scene. This agreement cannot be verified. We are now learning that the 24/7 access to inspections promised by the President does not exist. Under this agreement. the regime can stall any inspection for many weeks or even months. The Presidents promise that violations will result in a snapback of sanctions is also completely empty. Restoring sanctions would require the assent of China and Russia. something much less likely. given our rapidly deteriorating relations with them. And even if Iran scrupulously abided by every detail of the agreement. they can continue to run centrifuges for lowlevel enrichment. continue their research and development of advanced centrifuges. continue their heavy water research. and within 8 years acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles. That means. even under this agreement. within a decade. Iran will have a nuclear breakout capability and the launch vehicles necessary to deliver those weapons anywhere in the world with the solemn vow of its government to wipe Israel and the United States off the map. Indeed. just last week. the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff warned: ""Under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking."" Yet a week later. that is exactly what this agreement does. The President says there is no alternative. Well. this is utter nonsense. The sanctions were working. The domestic resistance to this Islamicfascist dictatorship mustered over 100.000 Iranian expatriates at its annual meeting in Paris last month. This movement desperately needs the moral and material support of our Nation to bring down this regime from within. That is precisely what this administration has denied them. Last month. I fear the Congress became complicit in this agreement by adopting a completely extraconstitutional process for ratification that I believe was a sham. Instead of twothirds vote of the Senate to approve treaties. it requires an almost impossible twothirds vote of both Houses to reject it as an agreement. But at this moment in time. nothing is more important to the world than for twothirds of this Congress to repudiate this dangerous falling. Despite all of the indignities. retreats. and selfinflicted wounds our country has endured these past 61/2 years. the freedomloving people of the world still look to us for leadership and support. We are still what Lincoln called the last best hope of mankind. It is imperative that Congress now rise to the occasion."
1140104204,"Mr. Speaker. on the afternoon of June 22. a large number of Democrats brought the deliberations of the House of Representatives to a standstill in one of the most disgraceful and childish breaches of decorum in the history of this institution. In complete contempt of this House and the rule of law. they shouted down all with whom they disagreed. They blocked access to the microphones as Members sought to address the Chair. and they illegally occupied the Hall of the House. forcing an early adjournment and costing this House three full days of legislative deliberations. Abraham Lincoln said it best: ""There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law."" What we saw was the mob law of Occupy Wall Street brought to the House floor. They are seeking to use the recent terrorist attacks as justification for making it harder for lawabiding Americans to defend themselves. That is a strange logic. but so be it. They certainly have a right to their opinions. They have a right to express those opinions on the House floor. and they have a right to use all of the procedures of the House to act on their opinions. What they do not have is the right to prevent those with different views from exercising the same rights. and yet that is precisely what they did. These Democratic Members have many procedures and opportunities to bring their bills to the House for a vote. They could have executed a discharge petition to bring their bill immediately to the floor. They could have moved to have their bill inserted into any bill pending on the House floor. a common motion that we routinely hear and vote upon several times a week. The fact is their proposals were considered in the Senate and voted down. Their proposals were considered in the House committee and voted down. Their discharge petition is pending at this desk right now. awaiting enough signatures to execute it. Their only problem is they dont have enough votes. Well. sorry. that is called democracy. The majority of their colleagues simply disagree with them for some very good reasons. Their rights were honored and protected by the Republican majority under the rule of law. yet they denied those same rights to others by replacing the rule of law with the rule of the mob. and they did so on the most sacred ground of our democratic Republic. the Hall of the House of Representatives. Instead of working within the timehonored rules of the House to convince the majority of their way of thinking. they decided to tear down the rules. This was the lawless left on full display. and I hope the American people took a long. hard look at it and understand the threat to our democratic traditions and institutions that this conduct reveals. In recent days. we have seen leftist mobs assembled under a foreign flag violently attacking American citizens who were merely trying to exercise their right to peaceably assemble to support their candidate for President. We have seen this administration attempt to criminalize political dissent and use our institutions of government to intimidate people out of participating in our political process. And now we have watched this lawless behavior imported onto the floor of the House of Representatives. The House leadership decided not to confront this unprecedented spectacle as it unfolded. and I do not gainsay their decision here. It was obvious the Members involved were trying to provoke a physical confrontation. but serious damage was done that day to our orderly process of government and it cannot go unchallenged. Doing so would establish a dangerous and corrosive precedent. antithetical to everything which this institution and our country stands for. The Constitution provides that the House may sanction Members for disorderly behavior. and the Members responsible for the events of June 22 and 23 must be called to account for their actions. If we fail to do so. we will have replaced the House rules with rules for radicals."
1140111277,districtwere designated as critical habitat. Again. throughout this process. the Fish and Wildlife Service claimed there would be no negative impacts to Sierra communities. We learned that claim to be false almost immediately. For years. a race called the Lost Sierra Endurance Run. a 50kilometer. has been held on existing trails and roads throughout the town of Graeagle in Plumas County. California. Run by a local small local nonprofit. the race generates thousands of dollars for trail maintenance and has a significant economic impact on a little town know as Graeagle. with local hotels. restaurants. and shops benefiting from the visitors the race draws to the area. as well as people being able to enjoy the outdoors and see what their public lands are all about. However. last year. before the critical habitat designation was even complete. the nonprofit was told they would need to pay to conduct a study on the impacts of the race on the yellowlegged frogan impact study. Federal agencies were concerned that runners using existing trails might negatively impact the frogs. The study the Federal agencies demanded was costly enough to more than wipe out any proceeds from the race. and the organizers were forced to cancel it. Not only would runners not be visiting the area. but now. trail conditions will deteriorate without the funding the race generated. Yes. the funding that the race generated was there to help keep the habit and the trails maintained. This is the second year that the race has not occurred. and it is likely that it. with the visitors it brought to the area. is gone permanently. What is next? Limits on walking through the area within a critical habitat? Colleagues. it may sound absurd. but Federal agencies have already expressed concern that running within this designation could harm frogs. Imagine all the other activitiesusing offroad vehicles. hunting. fishing. camping. bird watching. hikingthat agencies likely view as dangerous to frogs. As we watch the West burn this time of year. we observe the failure of Federal ownership and nonmanagement of the publics lands. Compare private timberlands versus the public. Private is fireresistant and healthy. by and large. where they are able to manage their own lands. You can fly over it and see the checkerboard pattern of public versus private. Before a fire. you see it being managed. After a fire. you see the private lands. where they go back out there and get the lands recovered and replanted again. Public land sits there with a bunch of snags. dead timber. brush growing up. and becomes the next tinderbox in 5 or 7 years. Indeed. the damage from these massive fires we have these days. these catastrophic fires. isnt just to the trees. It is to the habitat. to the wildlifethe very habitat they are fighting against us on. When you have these devastating fires. the next winter. what do you get? Ash and silt all washing down into the creeks. streams. rivers. and lakes. making it bad for the fish. You dont have the habitat there for owls or anything else that used to be there when the forest was still standing. Somehow. there are a handful of extremists that think this is somehow good. Oh. we need these burned lands. California is full. at this point. with about 66 million dead trees. by the U.S. Forest Services own estimates. This isnt just an isolated tree here and there. Now you can see entire groves that are just waiting for the next lightning strike or the next spark. and it is going to be bigtime problems for those areas to try and put them out. The Forest Service even goes so far as to resist the opportunity for doing land swaps with land that has already been managed. thinned. properly left by private concerns. Where they can then move on to take some trails into public ownership. that would be beneficial for the public as well as private entities being able to manage the formerly public land. They resist these kind of swaps because they want to buy more. acquire more. with money we dont have. Each new national monument. wilderness. critical habitat designation. or study area limits the tools to promote healthy forests. With the desire and even mandate for new renewable electricityespecially the mandates in Californiaforest biomass is one of the greatest opportunity potentials we have. It is something we need to be doing yesterday. in order to generate the electricity and bring the jobs that would come from removing that extra material in a way that is good for the ecology. for the forest. and bring those jobs right in the districtnot building solar cells in China or wind machines in Europe. but jobs right in our own backyard. thinning these forests. using the material and putting it into a power plant that can generate renewable electricity to meet the mandate of 50 percent California sees and that other States will probably start adopting. We can be putting these jobs back home. improving forest safety and fire safety. preserving the habitat. keeping the water quality up. and. yes. bringing the jobs home for those paper and wood products that we still all need. Instead. we watch them burn because they are unwilling to do what needs to be done. They are afraid to do what needs to be done. There is not enough money in the U.S. Treasury to go out and try to recover all that habitat. plant those forests back. which is what the private sector could be doing when it manages it and is allowed to make a little bit of living at a time. So we have got a lot of work to do in getting this message across on the way the West is dominated by poor management at the Federal level. I hope those people listening tonight will take this to heart and give us the backing we need to accomplish better policy goals and make it so that our Western lands. our Western economies. our Western habitats can actually be preserved with wise management. not this debacle we see happening every fire season. So. again. to my colleague. Mr. GOHMERT. I thank him so much for having this time here tonight for us to be able to spotlight this once again for our American people and for our colleagues. I appreciate it.

980092253,Mr. Chairman. H.R. 5 establishes an ocean and coastal resources block grant program. Similiar legislation was first introduced in September 1981. Since then. we have thoroughly considered this measure In a fully bipartisan and cooperative manner. We have made Important chainges to strengthen and Improve thebill. It is now ready to be enacted into law. This was shown most recently when the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries favorably reported the bill by a vote of 37 to 2. Mr. Chairman. the RECORD contains many statements supporting this measure and its simple logic. We have shown that it is a. fair bill. It will~provide coastal States with Federal assistance similar to that given to States affected by the leasing of Interior Federal lands. We have shown that current policies of the administration are counterproductive. that they have led to unprecedented conflict between the Federal and State Governments. and that they are actually constraining OCS development. We have shown that H.R. 5 will promote partnership instead of conflict. We have shown that the bill conforms to the Presidents program of New Federalism by increasing State responsibilities and decreasing Federal bureaucratic restrictions. We have shown that support for this Idea is broad. and that it crosses the lines between the majority and the minority. between government and industry. and between resource use and environmental quality. Finally. and perhaps most Importantly. we have shown that this rather modest investment can result in manyfold returns to the U.S. Treasury. through reduced FederalState conflict and enhanced OCS leasing revenues. Mr. Chairman. our committee has had many days of hearings on this measure. We have heard many witnesses. We have made many refinements. H.R. 5 is a timely and thoroughly considered bill. It has proven support and the cosponsorship of 118 Members of the House. It will help Insure broadened development of a major domestic. energy resourcethe OCSand it will do this in a way that. provides the necessary mechanism for protection of important environmental resources. I urge final passage. Mr. Chairman. I would like to briefly touch on two additional points. The first is equity. one of the basic premises of H.R. 5 and one of the reasons this legislation has received such strong inland State support. As you know. there is presently a serious Inequity in the way we handle the receipt of revenues generated by energy activity on Federal lands. Under the Mineral Leasing Act. the Federal Government turns over 50 percent of all revenues to the States when the Federal lands in question are within a States borders. Inland States reap more than $1 billion a year from Federal leasing activity to help them offset the negative impact of such development. On the other hand. coastal States with energy activities off their coasts. are accorded none of these revenue sources. Yet the coastal Impacts from these activities are well documented and the pace of OCS activities are likely to be vastly accelerated in the next few years. Sonlie have Insisted that no Inequity exists because onshore leasing occurs within the boundaries of a Statewhile OCS leasing takes place entirely outside of the States territorial sea. Such an argument is fallacious. Federal lands are held in trust by the Federal Government as the natural heritage of all Americans. The fact that a particular tract of Federal land is situated within one State does not provide that State with any unique Interest in. or claim to. that land except as its use or development bear upon the State. The extraction of national resources from Federal landswhether such lands are onshore or offshoreshould involve the equitable treatment of affected States. The provisions of H.R. 5 will help correct the serious inequities in existing policy. The second issue I would like to mention is how much money the Federal Treasury will continue to lose if revenue sharing is not enacted. One of the primary financial Justifications for approving H.R. 5 Is that revenue sharing would help to establish a working partnership between State governments and the Federal Government with regard to OCS development. The clear failure to establish such a relationship in the past has delayed the landing of vital domestic oil and gas supplies. caused a significant loss of revenues to the Federal Treasury. and hampered effective coastal zone management. There is good reason to believe that these problems could get worse. As you may be aware. the current administration has repeatedly targeted State coastal management programs for elimination. Without alternative funding schemes. like revenue sharing. the coastal States organization has testified that the State staffs necessary to discharge existing statutory review responsibilities for OCS activities and other related coastal development will be lost. Further testimony before my Subcommittee on Oceanography has indicated that. if this capacity Is lost. States will resort to whatever delaying tactics are at their disposal until they can adequately assess the impacts of OCS exploration. development. and production plans. No one should doubt that States and localities have the capacity to effectively delay OCS development. The Department of the Interior. In an unreleased study prepared last year for the Cabinet Council on Natural Resources Working Group on Revenue Sharing. estimated that State and local opposition costs the Federal Treasury $1 billion a year. The report goes on to state that this Is an exH.6825 tremely conservative estimate and that a number of factors which will likely raise the cost considerably were not used in the calculation due to the difficulty in quantifying them. The final and concluding paragraph of this Interior study finds that. and again I quote: The only apparent solution to reducing the costs of opposition to the OCS program Is. to provide States and localities with an Incentive to support leasing which is perceived by the States and localities as sufficient to counterbalance their perception of the potent ial harm and risk to which they are subject. OCS revenue sharing is the best incentive available to achieve that counterbalance. On this I concur. H.R. 5 is not going to mitigate all opposition or reduce all the costs to the U.S. Treasury. But it w ill for the first time give States a direct. visible. monetary interest in the growth and health of the OCS oil and gas leasing program and it will insure that States have the manpower necessary to be full partners in the process. Without it. distrust between the States and the Federal Government will continue to growv and everyone will lose. I strongly urge the adoption of this vital legislation. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
980147144,Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 2900. as amended by the substitute H.R. 3597. I want to thank the chairmen and ranking members of the various committees and subcommittees for their diligent work in bringing this bill to the floor. I would like to focus on the two titles of the bill directly pertinent to the jurisdiction of the Oceanography Subcommittee. Title IV of this bill is identical to H.R. 1547. which was unanimously reported out by the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries on May 11. 1983. This title amends and reauthorizes title II of the Marine Protection. Research and Sanctuaries Act. dealing with research related to ocean dumping of wasteful materials. The authorization of $12 millIon for fiscal years 1984 and 1985 is equal to the previous authorization level. The $12 million will provide funds for several important programs. including the study of longterm effects of ocean dumping. monitoring of ocean dumpsites. regional research projects on ocean dumping. and the Northeast monitoring program. Title IV also gives explicit direction to the Environmental Protection Agency to assess the feasibility of establishing regional waste management plans. and to perform a comprehensive. multimedia analysis of sewage sludge disposal Jn the New York City area. Title V of the bill is identical to H.R. 1546. which was also unanimously reported out of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries on May 11. 1983. It reauthorizes the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act for fiscal years 1984 and 1985 at $3 million a year. which is consistent with the authorization level requested by the administration. The National Ocean Pollution Planning Act was designed to coordinate the various Federal agencies conducting pollution research and monitoring. to identify duplication of effort and to identify areas that are not being adequately addressed. Mr. Chairman. the members of our two committees feel strongly that at a time when ocean dumping activities may be increasing. there is a growing need for additional information on the effects of such dumping. Many of the research activities authorized by this bill particularly those in title IV are slated for reduction or elimination by the administration. The provisions of this bill are intended to maintain the existing research programs in order to provide the scientific information needed to predict the consequences of ocean dumping. and thus increase our ability to minimize adverse impacts on marine ecosystems. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Chairman. I again thank the chairman. the gentleman from North Carolina . for yielding to me. and I urge my colleagues to strongly support this legislation.
980206677,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3921. the New Hampshire Wilderness Act of 1984. This is a proud day for the State of New Hampshire. and has arrived due in no small measure to the effective and skillful leadership of the Interior Committee and particularly my distinguished friend and colleague from Ohio. the chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and National Parks. II.R. 3921 would designate an additional 77.000 acres in the White Mountain National Forest as wilderness. This legislation is the product of mny months of dedicated effort by the ad hoc White Mountain National Forest Advisory Committee. representing a broad spectrum of National Forest users. Given the diversity of interests concerned. the ad hoc committee can take great pride in its accomplishment. I think I speak for all who appreciate and will come to enjoy the wilderness experience in saying that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the 11.5333 members of the ad hoc committee for their many years of hard work. This legislation also includes a provision very similar to my bill. II.R. 4406. which passed this House on April 30. 1984. This provision would amend the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act by including. for study purposes. the Wildcat Ifiver in Jackson. N II.. thereby insuring the continued protection of the Wildcat as a unique natural resource and outstanding scenic attraction. Also included is a provision that would extend the boundary of the White Mountain National Forest to include valued tracts of land in the Pilot Range. This provision has been included in anticipation of the acquisition of the Pilot Range by the Forest Service. Mr. Speaker. all these measures enjoy the strong support of the citizens of New Hampshire. conservationists. and forest users alike. Favorable action today on Il.R. 3921 will insure the protection arid preservation of our rich natural heritage for the benefit of future generations. It is for this reason that I urge my colleagues to support tire passage of the New Hlampshire bill.
980237791,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the appointment of Anne Burford to head the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere is absolutely preposterous. It is asking the fox to guard the henhouse. Over the weekend Mrs. Burford showed us all what she thinks of her new position. She calls NACOA a ""joke"" and a ""nothingburger."" whatever that is. Nothing I could say could more graphically demonstrate the contempt she has shown. and will continue to show again. for public service in general and for environmental protection in particular. As I just said. Mr. Speaker. the appointment of Anne Burford to head NACOA is preposterous. We must not let this nomination stand without strong and continuing objection. NACOA is not a ""Joke."" and the Burford appointment is certainly no laughing matter. I make this motion as chairman of the Subcommittee on Oceanography. and this is the subcommittee that created NACOA. This is the subcommittee that authorizes appropriations for NACOAs continuance. In my capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Oceanography. I have worked personally with Anne Burford on questions involving ocean pollution. I have found her to be insensitive and unresponsive to the point where I think she is an antienvironmentalist. Given the nature and given the importance of this advisory panel. given its legislatively mandated qualifications for membership. given the legacy of the Burford Environmental Protection Agency. and given the demeaning and disparaging re. marks Anne Burford made this weekend about the Agency she wants to head. I believe this appointment is totally unsupportable by anybody who believes in protecting the American environment. Over the years NACOA has provided Congress and the administrations with an independent. a reasoned. and. most importantly. a bipartisan perspective on national oceans and atmospheric policy. The key to NACOAs effectiveness has been its bipartisanship. the bipartisanship of its analyses and the bipartisanship of its recommendations. In the eyes of those who have closely followed NACOA over the past several years. Dr. John Knauss. the current Chairman. has been a pivotal factor in its success. Dr. Knauss has been a piv. otal factor in its success because he has been nonpartisan. He is an eminent scholar. and he has vast expertise in the field of oceanography. He has performed his duties in a professional and. as I Indicated. a nonpartisan manner. Now. contrast this with Mrs. Burfords 22month tenure at the Environmental Protection Agency. It was marked by controversy. by ineptitude. and by scandal. She filled several high positions in EPA with representatives from the various industries they were supposed to impartially regulate. Many of her top appointees. including her General Counsel and Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response. were forced to leave their posts under accusations of political manipulation. impropriety. and gross mismanagment. As head of the Agency charged with carrying out the environmental laws enacted by Congress. Mrs. Burford abdicated this responsibility by seeking devastating reductions in EPAs budget. Many of the regulatory decisions that she made were so strongly opposed by the American public that she herself was forced to reverse them. Suchwas the case with her attempt to increase the amount of lead content in gasoline. Her administration of the Superfund project. program. it is common knowledge. was an utter dis aster. As a result of the reign of terror of Mrs. Burford at EPA. she left a demoralized and emasculated Agency. To their credit. many highly competent civil servants left the EPA rather than become a party to the ravishing of U.S. environmental policy. but worst of all. what Mrs. Burford did was to undermine the trust of the average American in the Agency charged with protecting his or her environment. Now. I would call the attention of the Members to the fact that the NACOA enabling legislation is very specific about the necessary qualifications for membership on NACOA. Each member must be ""eminently qualified by way of knowledge and expertise"" in one or more oceanic or atmospheric fields of discipline. Clearly. the appointment of Anne Burford is not consonant with this requirement. Quite frankly. this appointment under the circumstances is a slap in the face to the American people. Americans have demonstrated overwhelmingly time and again that they want a clean and healthful environment and they want their environmental policymakers to share these goals. Mrs. Burford left the Environmental Protection Agency because she had lost public trust. Her performance as head of EPA provides absolutely no basis for confidence in her ability to fulfill the responsibilities of this important environmental policy position. The appointment of Mrs. Burford to this crucial post is bad environmental policy. I would call your attention to this fact. The House resolution merely sends a clear message to the administration that this House feels Anne Burford is absolutely unfit to chair the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere and that the appointment should be withdrawn. Now. look. we are realists. We know we cannot force the President to cancel this appointment. We cannot force the President to ask Anne Burford to step down. but we certainly can and we are most respectfully and in a fully bipartisan way asking the President to arrange Mrs. Burfords departure from NACOA and do it in the interests of the American publics right to the best environmental protection we can provide them. That is all we are asking. I urge the Members of the House to strongly. to overwhelmingly pass this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York . the sponsor of the current resolution."
980248567,Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in support of the amendment. V~r Chairman. I first of all want to pay tribute to the gentleman from Georgia for having brought this amendment to our attention. I think sometimes in the process of the excitement of passing on something as important as a Superfund bill. as expensive as a Superfund bill. we sometimes tend to lose track of what we are doing. The reason we are cleaning up these toxic waste dumps. full of chemical pollution. is because they are hurting people. I do not serve on the Commerce Committee nor on the Public Works Committee. but I do have constituents in New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman. who have been and are being harmed because they happen to live close to toxic waste dumps. Now. all the gentleman from Georgia. in this amendment. seeks to do is to give them a fair chance at some kind of remedy. They cannot go to court because they cannot afford the enormous cost. toxicological reports. and the like. of preparing a case. They cannot go to court because they cannot wait for the 2. 3. 4. or more years that a courtlitigated case might take. They cannot go to court because they may live next to a toxic waste dump that has been closed and abandoned. and no one has any idea or can prove who. in fact. they should be suing. All the amendment of the gentleman from Georgia does isto give these people a chance to recoup their costs. to recoup some of their costs. to recoup their medical expenses. because they cannot affort to pay them. They happen to be people of sometimes very. very meager and modest means. We are trying in this amendment to give the people who have been poisoned. whose children have leukemia. who themselves have been hurt and are ill because they happen to live next to a toxic waste dump some remedy which they otherwise would not have. Now. let me say that I have heard that 12 percent is too much money. I do not serve on the committee. I do not know whether 12 percent is a little too much or maybe not enough money. But I do know that nobody here Is coming forth with any alternative that they think would be the proper amount of money. And I think that if they are going to make that claim. then they should tell us what amount of mone6j we should be spending. if they think this is too much. They certainly should not say we are going to destroy the fund entirely if you cannot prove that this is not too much money. That is not a fair burden to put upon the proponents of the fund. Those people who fear that these expenses are going to consume the entire Superfund. I would say first. it clearly is not an entitlement program. and secondly. the rights of the people who are recompensed under the fund are subrogated to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government can take their place and recover these costs plus the fund is paid for any other payments these people might have access to. Lest you think we are going to bankrupt the United States of America by this. remember that 86 percent of all Americans are insured privately. That money is going to help to nay for some of these expenses. If we do not think that we are talking about people with serious illness or injury in this debate. then we are missing the point. We are going to spend a lot of money cleaning up toxic waste. a lot of that money is going to go to contractors whose business it is to clean up these sites. A lot of that money is going to go to bureaucrats. All we are suggesting is that some of that money should go for the purpose to which that whole concept is direct-
980252760,Mr. Speaker. I thank the committee chairman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of the conference report on S. 2463. legislation which would forge a new FederalState partnership in ocean and coastal resource management and offshore oil and gas development. I would like to say just for the record. reflecting no inordinate pride of subcommittee chairmanship and with all due deference to the gentleman .from Louisiana [Mr. BREAuxJ. chairman of the Subcommittee on Pisheries and Wildlife. an admittedly ubiquitous member of the committee. that this bill did emerge from the Subcommittee on Oceanography. for which my good friend. the gentleman from Alaska . is making proper penance for having misspoke at this time. Mr. Speaker. Chairman JONES has already detailed the provisions of the conference report for the House. Let me just say that this legislation is similar in its specific provisions and identical in Its thrust to H.R. 5. which was overwehimingly approved by the House on September 14. 1983. by a vote of 30198. One reason it passed the House so convincingly was that Members agreed that the bill was fiscally responsible. Opponents have argued that ocs revenue sharing will bust the budget. This is most assuredly not the case. In fact. it is the absence of legislation of this nature which is significantly adding to our already oversized Federal budget deficit. A study prepared by the Department of the Interior 2 years ago for the Cabinet Council on Natural Resources working group on revenue sharing estimated that State and local opposition to OCS leasing costs the Federal Treasury $1 billion a year. Thats $1 billion a year. and the report goes on to say that this is a conservative estimate. The final and concluding paragraph of this Reagan administration study finds that: The only apparent solution to reducing the costs of opposition to the OCS Program is to provide States and localities with an incentive to support leasing which is perceived by the States and localities as sufficient to counterbalance their perception of the potential harm and risk to which they are subJct. OCS rvenue sharing is the best incentive available to achieve that counterbalance. OCS revenue sharing is not going to mitigate all opposition or reduce all costs to the U.S. Treasury. But it will for the first time give States a direct. visable. monetary interest in the growth and health of the OCS Leasing Program and It will insure that the States have the manpower necessary to be full partners in the process. Without it. distrust between the States and the Federal Government will continue to grow and everyone will lose. II19178 This conference report is unique In that it is supported by both Democrats and Republicans. the environmental community. the oil and gas industry. and State and local governments. It is a fair conference report that deserves the Houses support.
980253642,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of S. 1102. which. among other things. reauthorizes the National Marine Sanctuary Program. The House counterpart to this provision is H.R. 2062 which was Introduced by myself and Mr. PRITCHARD and passed the House on June 14. 1983 by the overwhelming vote of 379 to 38. The National Marine Sanctuary Program was created in 1972 in order to provide a mechanism to protect and manage valuable areas of our marine environment. Six sanctuaries have been designated to date. These sanctuaries have been designated to protect such diverse areas as the historically and culturally significant Civil War Ironclad U.S.S. Monitor. recreationally and educationally valuable reef areas off Georgia and Florida. and marine mammal and bird habitats off California that are important for their ecological conservation and research values. S. 1102 reauthorizes the program for 4 years. The authorization levels start at $3 million for fiscal year 1985 and increase to $3.9 million for fiscal year 1988. These levels will allow the designation and management of one new sanctuary per year. The program has not been without controversy. This is largely because of mistaken public perceptions about the goals and purposes of this program and because of the failure of Congress to provide clear policy directives. Many of the early problems were succesfully solved by the current program managers. and this bill attempts to correct the remaining outstanding problems. H.R. 2062. as passed by the House. would substantially amend title 3 of the Marine Protection. Research and Sanctuaries Act. It reaffirms that the mission of the program is the establishment of a system of national marine sanctuaries based on identification. designation. and comprehensive management of special marine areas for the longterm benefit and enjoyment of the public. It sets forth explicit purposes and policies for the program by codifying the programs existing goals and policies as set forth in the January 1982 ""program development plan"" for the National Marine Sanctuary Program. It establishes standards and factors for the Secretary of Commerce to apply when assessing areas of the marine environment for sanctuary designation. It outlines site designation procedures for the Secretary to follow. including broadened consultations with affected parties. participation by regional fishery management councils in the draftIng of fishingrelated regulations and a review period for Congress to analyze proposed sanctuaries. All of the major provisions of H.R. 2062 were acceptable to the Senate and are contained in S. 1102. Some modifications and clarifications are contained in the Senatepassed version and I want to briefly highlight them: S. 1102 requires the Secretary of Commerce. in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior. to complete a resource assessment report documenting present and potential uses of an area. including fishing. research and education. minerals and energy development. subsistence uses. and other commercial or recreational uses. S. 1102 clarifies the specific criteria used to determine when it Is appropriate for regional fishery management councils rather than the Secretary of Commerce to assume responsibility for drafting of sanctuary regulations. The Senate version is identical to the previous House version. however. In making clear that even when it falls to the regional councils to draft the regulations. it is up to the Secretary to make the final determination that the regulations are consistent with the purposes and policies of the program and the goals and objectives of the proposed sanctuary. S. 1102 reduces the time for congressional and gubernatorial disapproval from 90 days to 45 days and changes the concurrent resolution to a joint resolution. consistent with the Chadha decision. 8. 1102 makes in order a privileged and nondebatable motion to consider a joint resolution on the floor. and S. 1102 seeks to protect existing access and valid rights in current and proposed sanctuaries. with the understanding that access and rights are subject to regulation by the Secretary consistent with the purpose of the sanctuary designation. Mr. Speaker. these modifications are constructive and I see no reason why we should not adopt them. 8. 1102 and its companion bill H.R. 2062 represent carefully crafted cornpromises. The amendments will allow program managers to protect and comprehensively manage marine areas for the longterm benefit and enjoyment of the public by designating representative areas of the marine environment that are important because of their resource or humanuse values. yet will still insure that affected parties can be active participants in the designation process. This bill represents long hours of effort on the part of many people. I want to commend the Members of both Houses for their work on the bill. The sanctuary program is an important marine program. and I strongly believe that S. 1102 will strengthen the program. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.e The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time. was read the third time. and passed. and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table."
980268566,Mr. Speaker. I respectfully disagree with the conference report to S. 1097. My disagreement is not with regard to what is contained in the conference report. but rather what has not been adopted by the conferees. I wholeheartedly support the provisions contained in the conference report. but I am distressed that the acid precipitation reporting provision was not included in the report. As passed by the House. S. 1907 contained an important amendment that would have directed the National Weather Service to issue periodic reports on the acid content found in precipitation. Acid precipitation information is currently being collected by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program which was established by Congress in 1980. This information would have been transferred to the weather service to be issued as part of the routine local weather information. The purpose of this provision was simple. Acid precipitation is a national problem. Because the Northeastern United States are the most directly affected by acid precipitation. residents of those States have been the most vocal about solving the problem. Unfortunately. what is not understood is that large areas of the United Statesare vulnerable to damage. If we are to resolve this problem which is most evident in New England. we need to make the American public as a whole more aware of the scope of the problem. By presenting the information as part of regular weather reports. Americans could have begun to appreciate the fact that areas of the United States other than New England are at risk from acid precipitation. Undoubtedly. nothing short of a definitive plan of action for reducing acidic emissions will have a significant impact on halting this environmental devastation. I had sincerely hoped that we would have been able to enact a meaningful emissions reductibn program in this Congress. I believe our strongest ally in this effort to control acidproducing emissions is an informed and active public that understands the need for an immediate emissions reduction program and urges its elected representatives to respond accordingly. This amendilent would have aided in the effort to educate the public on the dangers of acid precipitation. It is unfortunate that shortsighted parochial interests led to the dropping of this provision. In closing. Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank Mr. FUQUA. Mr. SCHEUER. Mr. JONEs. and other Members of the House Conference Committee for giving me the time to try to get the Senate to agree to this provision.e

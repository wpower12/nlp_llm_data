980003638,Mr. Speaker. the medieval Jewish philosopher. Maimonides. is well remembered for a collection of his writings commonly referred to as A Guide for the Perplexed. It may behoove us as legislators to read that book now as we struggle to do the right thing about rising natural gas prices. Residential gas customers are faced with an increasingly intolerable situation. Prices continue to rise. demand is down. industrial conversions to other sources of fuel are on the upswing. Estimates for gas heating costs range from 25 to 40 percent more than the previous year. In my own area. gas bills have increased 43 percent in just 1 year. Central New York is known for its long and severe winters. Furnaces are turned on in October and run well into May. More homes are heated with natural gas than any other form of heat. People in New York State are conservation minded. They turned down their thermostats. they added extra insulation. they checked for heat loss and took the necessary precautions. They did everything they were supposed to do and they still do not understand why their gas bills look like phone numbers. The law of supply and demand does not apply in this case. Why? Because gas customers cannot comparison shop for their fuel. Gas customers. of necessity. must deal with a monopoly. Monopolies necessitate regulation and this means it is appropriate for the Federal Government to intervene. Government intervention in this case is not intrusive but essential. Anyone who pays gas bills is looking to Congress for relief. Unfortunately. none has been forthcoming due to a lack of consensus. Some people in this body have advocated escalating the schedule for decontrol specified in the Natural Gas Policy Act. Others advocate price freezes and still others contend recontrol is the best means of dealing with gas prices. The only point of general agreement. however. is that the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 is a nightmare. It should be reviewed and revised in a way that is fair to both users and the industry. But until that consensus is reached. there is something that can and should be done to help residential gas customers contend with fuel costs that are out of control and rising. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should Immediately investigate the socalled take or pay contracts entered into by natural gas producers and pipelines that require the purchase of more expensive new or deep gas while less expensive. more plentiful gas is shut In at the wellhead. If FERC declares it does not have the authority to modify or abrogate these contracts then Congress should enact the appropriate legislation to grant such powers. In anticipation of FERCs response. I have already cosponsored legislation to require the abrogation of take or pay clauses in contracts. Once this message Is delivered loud and clear. it is entirely possible that a resolution of the dilemma facing consumers across the country will become a reality. Time is of the essence and we must act now to preclude even greater shocks from occuring that will slow down economic recovery.*
980021245,"Mr. Chairman. let us look at what happened in the last few monthspeople all over the Nation are talking about recoverythey can feel it. They can almost taste it. The word is optimism. We in the Congress should not lose sight of this new spirit that has risen out there beyond the Potomac RiverI hope that this will trickle into these Halls so that we can fashion a budget that will build on this new optimism and not throw it all away by changing all the rules we set down last year. I do not believe that the Republicans have cornered the market on all the good ideas. Nor do I adhere to the philosophy that inherently all the initiatives from the Democrats lead to higher taxes or more spending. Both sides have to pull together to work out a compromise. Although I cannot accept or support the Democrats budget resolution. I do find some encouraging signs. which in the long run could lead more toward compromise than conflict. At the same time. I find significant parts of their proposal to be a return to the discredited and bankrupt policies of the past. The Democrats proposal does address some important national needs. I am impressed with the emphasis on education. especially in the areas of math and science. compensatory education. vocational education. guaranteed student loans. and civilian research and development. I may not agree with the exact funding levels they propose. but the emphasis is properly directed. Likewise. I am heartened to see the Democrats display such deep concern for reducing the deficit. It has been obvious to me for many years that unless deficit spending is controlled. leading ultimately to a balanced budget. the Nation is headed for economic disaster. Unfortunately. the Democrats recognize the problem but are not prepared to make the difficult but necessary choices to alleviate it. Instead. they revert back to the old formula of increasing taxes to finance increases in spending. In fiscal years 1983 and 1984. the only binding parts of their budget resolution raises taxes by more than $27 billion and spending by more than $6 billion over current policy. If for no other reason than the Democrats budget repeals the third year of the tax cut. the plan should be summarily rejected. The third year of the tax cut was designed primarily to benefit those in the middle and lower income groups. Yet the Democrats would deny this long awaited and much needed relief. The Democrats plan cuts $105 billion in budget authority and $163 billion in outlays over the next 5 years out of the defense function at a time when our national security is imperiled. The 4 percent real growth rate called for in the Democrats budget is 3Vg percent below what was recommended by the House Armed Services Committee. The only realistic component in their budget is the 4 percent pay raise for military personnel. The morale of our Armed Forces is essential to our readiness. The Democrats proposal is far too risky to be implemented. Some of the spending proposals in the Democrats plan merit immediate dissent. Four come immediately to mind. The recommendation for over $9 billion in fiscal years 1983 and 1984 to recreate the discredited public service jobs program serves no purpose. This program was wasteful before and it will be wasteful again. The creation of jobs must come from the private sector to have any lasting or significant value. The homeowner and farm mortgage assistance programs the Democrats espouse offer little real relief to the unemployed and could even exacerbate existing problems. Yet the programs were to be fully implemented. the cost would more likely be in the $6 to $8 billion range. If that is not enough. the Democrats advocate $20.5 billion for unplanned and unspecified public works between now and 1988. Mr. Chairman. I submit to you that such a request is pure pork barrel. In the major entitlement programs such as medicaid and military and civilian retirement. the Democrats acknowledge that there are serious financing problems. Report language clearly states the existence of the problems. yet the Presidents recommendations are rejected out of hand. Sadly. the Democrats fail to offer any alternatives. I strongly believe that the third year of the tax cut must remain intact. this was promised to the people in 1981. passed and implemented. Individuals have been planning on this for projecting their tax obligation on a 3year basis. Now the Democrats proposal turns around and says ""Sorry."" I do not blame the public when they say that you cannot trust the Government to stick to a policy. On balance. I must reject the Democrats plan. They have still to construct a realistic and workable alternative budget. Mr. Chairman. Edmund Burke once said. ""Government is a contrivance Df human wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a right that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom."" It is really a shame that this admonition will remain unheeded in the House of Representatives."
980027896,Mr. Chairman uncontrolled Federal spending still remains a major obstacle to economic progress. Despite repeated warnings from economists. leaders of financial institutions and an informed citizenery. we continue in the same direction. We all talk about reducing Federal spending but there is little stomach for making the hard choices evident in this body. What is lacking Is selfdiscipline in the Congress. It is much easier for us to vote to spend money than it is to restrain spending. It is much easier for us to pick up on a laudable goal. couch it in flowery language and then vote for massive sums to achieve that goal. An example of what is wrong with our political system is the mortgage foreclosure relief bill. H.R. 1983. Even the offical title of the bill. the Emergency Housing Assistance Act. sounds noble. Relief for people who are suffering from unemployment and other effects of the recession smacks of motherhood and apple pie. The bill would permit people an opportunity to obtain Federal funds to prevent the loss of their homes. The bill Is based on the premise that the plight of people facing foreclosure is real and immediate and something should be done. It is very difficult to argue against such a premise. No one wants to see familes uprooted from their homes and watch as their property is auctioned off by Simon LeGree bankers right in front of their eyes. But what is the solution to the problem? Is it merely spending Federal money? Apparently. some Congressmen think so. The bill before us recommends more than $760 million for homeowners relief. The real cost will probably be much higher. In effect. what is being created under this proposal is a new entitlement. Perhaps. not in the technical sense. but it certainly is in the political sense. People facing foreclosure will believe that they have the right to dip into the Federal Treasury to solve their personal problems. and once this right is established. it will be very difficult to turn the spigot off. If conventional patterns prevail. and I believe they will. this program will not be temporary recession relief. but will expand much in the same manner as other entitlements have expanded. Remedies to prevent foreclosure are already available in the private sector. Even the worst hardship cases receive equitable treatment from the majority of our lending institutions. The policy of forebearance. that is working out a financial arrangement between lenders and borrowers. is widely accepted and practiced. However. this policy would be severely threatened if all one had to do was turn to the Federal Government for a bailout. Unfortunately. some bad loans have been made. Yes. there are some people in our society who made poor financial decisions. Yet. the Federal Government. at the expense of the taxpayers. should not be expected to protect people who exercise poor judgment. We cannot prevent all foreclosures for all times. but our private sector can and does protect those who are making a genuine effort to help themselves. Mr. Chairman. the saddest part about the bill designed to lessen the incidence of home foreclosures is that it would do just the dpposite. This is a fundamental example of why the Federal Government gets itself into a position where it cannot manage its own resources. Paul Volcker. Chairman of the Federal Reserve. testified before the House Banking Committee just last week. He cautioned the Congress about profligate Federal spending. He predicted that there is significant likelihood of a return to a recessionary economy by 1985 or 1986 unless Federal spending is reduced now. Interest rates will rise. jobs will be lost. and we will undo all the work of the past 2 years. I hope that we will be able to prevent the enactment of this bill as reported from committee. We must stop indiscriminately using our scarce resources. and in this instance. resources that can only come from borrowed money. to create politically popular programs. that in the longrun are detrimental to the people they were designed to help. I ask my colleagues to listen carefully to the debate and ask themselves the key question. Will this bill help anyone who is in danger of losing his home? Or is it just another earnest. but misguided attempt to solve a problem by throwing money at it? Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
980034878,Mr. Speaker. when I first came to Congress. a seasoned veteran of many legislative battles gave me some very good advice. He said that the two words designed to chill the heart of any conscientious legislator are technical corrections. The previous Congress devoted a great deal of time and attention to the very real problems confronting the Nations thrift industry. In so doing. various avenues of assistance and nonassistance were explored. A consensus was reached eventuallythe Nations thrifts were worth saving. The enactment of the Depository Ihstitutions Act of 1982 gave the industry the tools it needs to see it through some difficult times. I supported the concept then and I support it now. Buried deep within title II of that act is a provision dealing with the issuance of income capital certificates and subordinated debentures. For those who were not Members of the 97th Congress. income capital certificates are paper transfers designed to bring up the net worth of troubled institutions to a specified level. Income capital certificates do not become real money unless an institution receiving such help goes into receivership. I know that this provision is in the law because I offered an amendment stating that the U.S. Government comes ahead of stockholders. subordinated debt holders. and* secured creditors should a financial institution receiving Federal assistance in the form of net worth guarantees fail. Before too many eyes start to glaze over. I will explain why I feel it is necessary for me to speak out on what most Members must consider to be an arcane subject. If one reads the debate in the other body on S. 1011. one might come away with the impression that the GarnSt Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 is inherently flawed. Supporters of this legislation believe that the bill is a necessary response to some unintended effects of language on income capital certificates and subordinated debt. I do not agree with that thesis. Supporters of this legislation have told us that there are several institutions around the country that would be eligible for income capital certificates except that they have outstanding debt instruments that contain a clause stating that the holders of these instruments shall be paid ahead of everyone else should the worst occur. The existing law precludes the FDIC from granting these savings banks income capital certificates. Yet the institutions seeking a change in the law made a commitment to their debt holders freely and clearly several years ago. That commitment has turned out to be most inconvenient for institutions seeking Federal assistance. Thus. they have petitioned Congress to have it overturned. The troubled institutions contend that if they do not receive the certificates. their net worth will be eroded further and their chances for survival as independent entities are diminished. The bill we are discussing manages to handle the debenture issue in a most artful way. It retains the FDICs primacy in the case of default. I applaud that aspect of the legislation because I believe it is good public policy to protect the Insurance funds integrity. Unfortunately. there are tradeoffs. It is this aspect of the legislation that I would like to call to my colleagues attention. In order to preserve the FDICs position. the bill provides for Federal preemption of the automatic default clause written into the outstanding subordinated debentures. While the bill is intended to remedy what some believe to be an unintended consequence of existing law. a precedent is likely to be established. People who now hold bonds with subordinated debt clauses may find May . 1988 that their bonds are being unloaded from trading portfolios. It is unlikely that the securities industry as a whole will be hurt by such a change in the law but bond holders could be in for an unpleasant surprise. We talk a lot about accountability in this body. Accountability is a virtue much admired in the abstract. We exhort its practice by one and all but what we are considering now would actually make financial institutions a little less accountable to their det holders. Institutions currently seeking net worth certificates must contact their debenture holders and inform them that their interests will be subordinated in order to obtain net worth certificates. It appears. however. that the way in which this bill is written. that step can be disregarded. Mr. Speaker. I will not belabor the point. This bill is not as simple as it seems. As such. I would be remiss if I did not bring a few of the legislations more interesting features to my colleagues attention. .
980062687,"Mr. Speaker. our distinguished former colleague. Albert Gore. Sr.. who served so ably in the other body. wrote an article on conference committees. He stated that the House of Representatives. except in rare instances. could be counted on to outconference its counterpart. The conference report on the first budget resolution bears out his thesis. The conferees work is. indeed. a tribute to those who would have us stay the course of taxing ourselves to the hilt to accommodate our voracious spending habits. In effect. it is no compromise. What it is is ingenious. The conferees agreed to establish a special reserve fund. This appears to be an interesting new way of providing even more opportunities for spending while ostensibly keeping the lid on deficits. at least for a while. The statement of the conferees provides for $8.525 billion in outlays in the reserve fund for seven functions described by some as ""high priority"" items. To lessen the shock for those of us who do not advocate massive new outlays for programs we can ill afford. this money does not show up on the deficit side of the ledger until the programs are authorized or the available reserve money will be lost. In the words of one of the conferees. the reserve fund is both in and out of the regular budget. Confused? Bear with me just a little longer. For the reserve fund to be activated. does only one body need to authorize the new spending programs? Do both bodies have to agree? The report is unclear. What is clear is that the deficit is bound to surge ever higher because there is no incentive to exert restraint. How are we to fund these new programs? That question is easier to answer. Congress simply increases taxes. Those who advocate adoption of the conference report stress that the revenues section is much closer to the amount recommended by the other body. That is true. but it makes little sense to me to remove the remaining vestiges of the 1981 tax cut at a time when they are sorely needed. If the taxes proposed in the conference report were earmarked for reducing the deficit a stronger case might be made for them. However. the conference report does not specify that. On the contrary. the taxes will be used to finance all of those items contained in the special reserve. The creation of costly new programs with borrowed money is a strange way to preserve the budget process. The American people will see through this clever but flawed attempt to be all things to all people. For the reasons I have mentioned. I urge my colleagues to join with me and vote against the conference report.e"
980077722,Mr. Chairman. this Congress has spent a great deal of time discussing jobs bills. Today. we are debating a very important jobs bill. Yes. a jobs bill. Not a public service employment program. not an expensive public works program. but a real jobs preservation and creation vehiclethe International Monetary Fund. It is been said that the International Monetary Fund has no constituency. However. the 5 million Americans whose jobs depend on exports might take issue with that statement. The United States exports 20 percent of Its manufactured goods and 40 percent of its agricultural products. The Commerce Department and others who keep tabs on these things estimate that every billion dollars of exports translates into 24.000 Jobs. If you extrapolate from those figures. Mr. Chairman. it is clear that maintaining free and open markets for our manufactured goods and agricultural products is a key component in global economic recovery. However. should the quota Increase for the IMF be denied. the markets for our products will contract severely. jeopardizing the jobs of the millions of American working men and women and stifling the recovery now underway. Lesser developed countries that need the IMFs help with balanceofpayments problems are good customers of the United States. In fact. they buy about 40 percent of exports. Closing off these markets is both shortsighted and dangerous. Recessions are contagious and so are recoveries. The economic downturn of the late 1970s and the first 2 years of this decade were felt throughout the world. We do not live in an isolated world. Mexicos serious economic difficulties in 1982 resulted in a reduction of U.S. Imports by $8 billion. At stake in just this one instance were over 200.000 American jobs. To deny that there is no relationship between what happens to our trading partners and our own economic wellbeing is nonsense. Jobs and interest rates are inextricably linked. When rates are high. jobs decrease. Yet some would have us play Russian roulette under the misguided assumption that we can somehow separate the two. If the bill we debate today fails. we can count on two things. Interest rates will skyrocket resulting in higher borrowing costs at home and abroad. Imports of American goods and products by the LDCs will plummet and so will our GNP. The choice is clear. We can vote for the quota increase and continue down the road of global economic recovery or we can bury our heads in the sand and await the inevitable crash. I urge each and every Member of this body to listen carefully to the debate on the International Recovery and Financial Stability Act. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 2957 deserves our support. Mr. St GERMAIN. Mr. Chairman. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York .
980083470,The substitute is a carefully crafted compromise designed to meet the genuine concerns raised by many Members about the International Monetary Fund. Because of this. it is something that most of us will be able to support. The compromise is not just another example of blue smoke and mirrors. Rather. it is a good faith attempt to address some of the major objections raised by many Members during the course of debate. For months. those opposed to this legislation said it is nothing more than a big bank bailout. Well. the substitute satisfies those who feel that way. This is tough language that requires the U.S. Executive Director to oppose and vote against any IMF loan used principally for the purpose of repaying banks. Sanctions are Included that preserve and promote the expansion of domestic industries. Foreign loans may not grow at a rate to exceed domestic lending. Banks will not be able to charge rescheduling fees in excess of administrative costs. This is not cosmetic. Every man and woman who serves in this body knows that preserving and promoting job opportunities is one of our foremost responsibilities. Approving the quota increase for the IMF is one of the most effective means of doing that. We would do a grave disservice to our constituents if we fail to support this legislation. I do not want the workers in my district to be laid off because orders for their goods from overseas customers suddenly stop. I do not want to face my farmers who are confronted with financial hardship because they cannot sell their products. The American people are not stupid. They recognize that we live in an economically interdependent world. They recognize that free and open trade between nations is the most effective means available for maintaining a stable world. The IMF is not perfect. But is one of the best vehicles we have for insuring financial stability abroad and prosperity at home. H.R. 2957 has been thoroughly debated and discussed. Each of us has had ample opportunity to hear and be heard on this legislation. -Now it is time to be counted. I urge every one to do the responsible thing and vote for the substitute amendment to title III. It Is a vote that you will not regret.
980128619,Mr. Chairman. for nearly a year now. I have been battered with letters. telegrams. phone calls. and sought after in my district by farmers who disapprove of the $1 assessment on dairy price supports. They are confused and upset as to why Congress could have implemented such an illconceived and unworkable plant to deal with the dairy surplus problem we face. From the beginning it was obvious that the assessment program would provide no incentive for farmers to reduce their milk production. no new medium for the Federal Government to empty its warehouses of the stockpiles of surplus dairy products and no boost to consumers in terms of lower price at the grocery store. Stnce the assessment program was adopted. Congress has continuously delayed action on legislation to rectify the situation. This delay has caused hardship for many farmers who feel the pressure of the $1 assessment. but hesitate making drastic changes in their operations because of what Congre ss may tell them to do next. One of my constituents summed it up In a letter to me when she wrote: I am writing this letter as a representative of a concerned farm family. We are experiencing extreme hardships created by Federal bureaucrats and legislation which will ultimately curtail our farm operation. as well as hundreds of others. to the point that we must search for other means of livelihood. Another constituent wrote: We have been dairying for 42 years and have never had anything threaten our livelihood like this $1 assessment. These farmers are the cornerstonme of American agriculture. They are struggling to survive under the auspices of an assessment plan that nobody takes credit for. I have talked to themthey know the magnitude of the problem faced by the Governmentand they are willing to help. They are not looking for a handout. They want to milk their cows and produce enough milk to supply consumers with fresh. fluid milk. butter. cheese. and the other dairy products that we all enjoy. They want a solution that is simple. equitable. and deals with the problem. The farmers in my district milked 53.500 cows. They produced 661.200.000 pounds of milk. They are a boon to the economy of my district. They help make New York the third largest dairy producing State behind Wisconsin and California. I am here today for each and everyone of them. We have the opportunity to straighten out a successful dairy program that has gone awry. I urge my colleagues to study the choices before us and make your decision to support legislation that is the best solution for the producersour farmers. for the consumersour constituents and for the Federal Governimentour responsibility.
980152740,"Mr. Speaker. Samuel Johnson wrote that ""events of history press upon the mind with the weight of truth."" I find It Incredible that Mr. Neil Kinnock. the leader of Great Britains Labour Party. has apparently failed to heed Samuel Johnsons prudent observation. Mr. Kinnock today begins a week of meetings with Government leaders in our country. It would behoove Americas leaders to remind him of British events which occurred four and one half decades ago. Reading last Sundays London Times. I was shocked to learn that. in recent days. when Mr. Kinnock met with a number of our colleagues visiting the House of Commons. he was asked by our distinguished colleague from California. BILL LOWERY. hoW. if he were Prime Minister. lie would respond If. in Congressman LowFRys words. ""the Soviets lobbed a nuclear bomb into the heart of London."" According to the London Times account. Mr. Kinnock replied he would not retaliate. The article further says that Mr. LOWERY told Mr. Kinnock if the United States failed to retaliate to a Soviet first strike. the failure would indicate ""a total lack of will and resolve to defend ourselves."" Mr. Speaker. it Is my firm con iction that Mr. Kinnocks naive attitudeif held by our President and Free World partners who possess nuclear weaponswould tend to encourage a preemptive Soviet attack. In my judgment. such a posture Is dangerous to our collective efforts to deter nuclear war and to maintain peace through strength. It Is inconceivable that the leader of the British Labour Party has not benefited from the tragic lcsson taught the late British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. How can Mr. Kinnock fail to recognie the devastating consequences of Chamberlains appeasement? Has Mr. Kinnock forgotten Chamberlains acquiescence to Mu:.solinis conquest of Ethiopia? Has Mr. Kinnock forgotten that Chamberlain signed the 1938 Munich Pact which recognized Hitlers territorial claims in Czechoslovakia? Can Mr. Kinnock forget that Chamberlain then promised ""peace in our time."" only to find his nation at war with the Axis Powers 1 year later? Mr. Speaker. the inscription on the front of the National Archives carries the admonition that ""Those who tend to forget history are doomed to repeat it. I would hope Mr. Kinnock would consider this admonition. How. we must ask Mr. Kinnock. can he ignore events of history which press upon the mind with the weight of truth?"
980250750,Mr. Speaker. drug trafficking and money laundering go together like ham and eggs. Cases brought to trial under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 illustrate how this one section of the underground economy operates. by approving the Money Laundering Penalties Act of 1984. Members can strike a blow against crime and for increased tax compliance. As a member of the Banking Committees General Oversight Subcommittee. I have had occasion to question the Federal financial regulators as well as representatives from the Treasury and Justice Departments about money laundering and the Bank Secrecy Act. Each of the Government representatives agreed that additional tools are needed to ferret out criminal activity involving the movement of large sums of money through financial institutions. They added that the Bank Secrecy Act. In its present form. needs augmentation if past successes such as Operation Greenback and Operation Banco were to be repeated. Not all currency laundering activities are of the size and scope of Operations Greenback and Banco. but when added together. add up to a serious amount of money. On June 20. the Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division of the Justice DepArtment told members of the Oversight Subcommittee: The Bank Secrecy Act has been effective in providing important leadssometimes. the initial leadin solving many narcotics crimes and in uncovering many money laundering schemes. However. the Act suffers from weaknesses that prevent if from serving as a superior law enforcement tool. For example. despite our successes. we believe that large amounts of unreported currency have been exported and imported annually. The weaknesses in the Bank Secrecy Act led to the development of important amendments of the Act and related stAtutes. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The Money Laundering Penalties Act. reported by the Judiciary Committee contains the changes sought by the Justice and Treasuary Departments. Increased penalties. attempt. increased reporting amounts. customs search authority. and rewards for informers all ensure that those who try to thwart the law wlU be caught and punished. I commend the Jddiciary Committee for its prompt and thorough work on a bill designed to keep law enforcement tools in tune with the times and urge all Members to cast an aye vote for the adoption of the Money Laundering Penalties Act of 1984.e

980002358,"Mr. President. during my years of service in the U.S. Senate. I have been a strong and consistent supporter of the free. Chinese people of Taiwan. I have viewed this country as a longtime. loyal friend and ally of the United States in a very unstable area of the globe. . As the 98th Congress gets underway. I wish to reiterate my support for this island nation. as well as my desire to see the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) upheld. The TRA affirms strong U.S. opposition to efforts directed at determining the future status of Taiwan by outside armed force. or economic warfare. including boycotts. or embargoes. or any means other than through peaceful negotiations. This act of Congress also stresses our determination to continue selling such military equipment to Taiwan as is determined to be necessary for their own selfdefense. As the Peoples Republic of China continues to expand and upgrade their own armed forces. it would be a drastic strategic error to deny Taiwan the military hardware essential for maintaining an adequate defense posture. Of course. any military equipment we sell to Taiwan or permit them to coproduce must be for defensive purposes only. Reallatically. however. the small island of Taiwan poses no offensive military threat to its mammoth neighbor. mainland China. and Taiwanese Government leaders have no viable expectation of retaking the mainland by force. The point that our Government must never forget is that Taiwans viability as an economic entity. as well as politically. is directly related to its defensive capabilities. Commercially Taiwan is -very important to the United States. Currently they are our seventh largest trading partner. In 1982. the volume of trade between our two countries ballooned to approximately $13.5 billion. Additionally. Taiwan has shown a great deal of cooperation in negotiating trade agreements with us. In the specific area of textile trade. Taiwan has been willing to restrict their export growth to American markets. On the other hand. mainland China has proven to be extremely uncooperative In this area. Efforts to reasonably limit massive imports of cheaply produced and subsidized textile and apparel goods from the PRC have been met with both a stone wall of resistance and with retaliatory trade embargoes against a number of American products. These actions are unjustified. especially in light of the many concessions and advancements the United States has toward the PRC in recent years in an effort to improve relations. Mr. President. I hope that my remarks are not misinterpreted. I am not advocating the start of another cold war in the Far East. and I applaud this administration as it attempts to preserve the delicate balance of relations with both Taiwan and the PRC. I simply feel that It is imperative that we do not shun the legitimate needs of our longtime friends on the Island of Taiwan. If we fail to demonstrate a strong commitment to our democratic allies in that area of the globe. It will jeopardize the credibility of U.S. policy in other parts of Asia and throughout the world. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ""Our OneChina Approach: Bad Diplomacy. Bad Policy."" be included in the REcoTD at the conclusion of my remarks."
980022512,"Madam President. I am reintroducing today. by reQuest. the administrationia proposed constitutional amendment relating to voluntary school prayer. This amendment was originally introduced last year as Senate Joint Resolution 199 and was the subject of 3 days of hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. I would anticipate that further action will be taken on this amendment by the committee in the near future. As with an increasing number of .constitutional proposals. the school prayer amendment represents a response to a controversial Supreme Court decision that many believe to have substantially altered the traditional understanding of the Constitution. In my view. the proposed amendment is necessary to restore the meanIng of the first amendment that had existed throughout most of the Nations history. only to be abruptly upset by the Court in 1962 and 1963 rulings. Until these rulings. the religion clauses of the first amendment had been understood primarily to prohibit the Congress from establishing any state church. or from favoring any particular church or denomination as a matter of general public policy. It was designed. further. to insure that the distinction between the sphere of the church and that of the state not be altogether obscured in the Amerfcan socIopolitical system. As Justice Story has observed in his ""Commentaries on the Constitution."" The real object of the First Amendment was . .. to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment which would give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government. Similarly. Professor Edward Corwin. the great constitutional scholar. has written. The historical record shows beyond peradventure that the core Idea of an establishment of religion"" comprises the Idea of preference and that any act of public authority favorable to religion in general cannot. without manifest falsification of history. be brought under the ban of that phrase. During most of the Nations history. this understanding of the first amendment controlled the development of public policy. While the Constitution took scrupulous pains to avoid the establishment of a theological republic. and even greater pains to insure freedom of worship for all citizens. it did not undertake to create an absolute and wholly unbridgeable division between the secular sLate and all things of a spiritual character. Indeed. there was a profound awareness of the religious roots of our Netkn and a desire to insure that tLe rflIous impulse remain a part of .m. us constitutional and political fabric. What has emerged. however. in recent years has been a constitutional doctrine that has no serious basis in the historical development of the organic law of the country. In two significant Supreme Court decisions. Engel v. Vitale. 370 U.S. 421 (1962) and Abington School District v. SchempA 374 U.S. 203 (1963). the Court gave expression to the idea that the establishment clause of the first amendment constructed an absolute ""wall of separation"" between church and state. The theory of these cases was that the constitutional direction to Congress to ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion"" not ..nly prohibited preference being given to denominational religious doctrine but utterly banned religious expression from the public life of the Nation. The original intent that Congress be neutral as between religious viewsas well as that it avoid obscuring the distinction between church and statewas transformed into a notion of neutrality between religion and Irrelision. Specifically. in Engel. the High Court ruled unconstitutional a requirement of the State of New York that each schoolday begin with a brief prayer. The New York prayer read: Almighty God. we acknowledge our dpendence upon Thee. and we beg Thy bilssings upon us. our parents. our teachers. and our country. In Abington. a year later. the Court ruled unconstitutional a requirement of the State of Pennsylvania that each schoolday begin with a brief reading of Bible verse. including the Lords Prayer. In both of these decisions. the State requirements were deemed to be in violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment. It Is interesting to note that the Court. In these cases. chose to use the first amendment as a limitation upon State legislative enactments despite the fact that the amendment Is explicit in referring only to ""Congress"". It is not my Intent to argue the merits of the 14th amendment incorporation theory of the Bill of Rights except to note that the intent of the first amendment was originally to limit Congress. not the States. As former Justice Potter Stewart remarked in dissent in Abington. * * it is not without irony that a conlstiLu tional provislon evidently designed to leaiv the States free to go their own way should now have become a restriction upon their autonomy. Since the decisions in Engel against Abington. despite the opposition of overwhelming numbers of American citizens of all religious views. the ""wall of separation"" interpretation of the establishment clause has led to a total prohibition upon legal prayer in the public schools. no matter how voluntary. no matter how interdenonina tional. and no matter how much accomodation is made for students of minority- religions and those who reject any religious values altogether. Given the Integral part thatcompu sory public schooling plays in the development of the values of our citizenry. I have become convincedand I believe that the great majority of people in this country share my viewthat these Supreme Court decisions have created a situation in which the state has become antagonistic toward religious values. The average child is placed in the public school classroom for 8 hours a day in which he Is developed intellectually. physically. and emotionally. but in which even a moment of structured personal reflection and introspection is treated as unconstitutional. This child is taught political theory. he is taught sex education. he is taught hygiene. he is taught baseball and football. he is taught music and art. he is taught virtually everything that goes into the building of individual character. but he is absolutely forbidden from a brief moment of prayer at the outset of his school day. Of course. the primary responsibility for the teaching of religious values. rests with the family. In my view. the primary responsibility for most of any childs education rests with the family. That does not mean. however. that a brief period of silence or prayer in the schoolroom is wrong. Such a period is nothing more than an effort to insure that what time the child does spend in the classroom offers a reasonable opportunity for him to develop and mature in a wellrounded and balanced manner. Those who feel that religious values are frivolous or destructive ought to be free to withdraw their children from such prayer. in the same manner that they are free to withdraw their children from sex education courses. They should not be free. however. to deny to all children a personal experience that was important in the development of the character of millions of schoolchildren from the outset of our Nation. We rewrite history. as well as the Constitution. when we ignore or make light of the fundamental and enduring contribution made by religion to American society. Ours is a secular nation. but it is not one in which secularism has yet been raised to a religious status itself. Madam President. the amendment that I am introducing today reads. Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public institutions. No person shall be required by the United States or by any State to participate in prayer. Although I am introducing this amendment by request. and expect to be looking at modifications of language as it is processed by the Judiciary Committee. I believe that this is a reasonably sound amendment. The amendment would insure that the establishment clause of the first amendment no longer poses a presumed barrier to exercise of voluntary prayer in the public school classroom. It would. however. not create any corollary right in any person to require that prayer be allowed in the public school classroom. The amendment would simply leave these decisions to the discretion of the State or local school district. There would be no obli. gation 3n their part to allow prayer. but merely an ability to do so if that is their choice. The amendment would also insure that no one is required to participate in structured group prayer against their desires. As the second sentence of the amendment makes clear. reasonable accommodation would have to be made for any individual who. for whatever reason. chose not to engage in such prayer. Madam President. it is my under-. standing that Senator HATCH. chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution. has indicated his commitment to proceed with 1 or 2 days of hearings this spring on the proposed amendment. This would supplement the 3 days of hearings that were held on this matter during the 97th Congress. Following these hearings. it is my intention to expedite the passage of the immediate resolution through the full Judiciary Committee. During this process. we will be taking a careful look at the provisions of the ad. ministrations amendment with an eye toward making it the most concise and the most reasonable amendment that we can develop. In particular. there are two matters that I expect to be the focus of my own attention: (a) insuring that the amendment I clear that reasonable accommodation will be made to those schoolchildren who choose not to participate in group or individual prayer. and (b) addressing the issue of how the content of any group prayer will be established. While I believe very strongly that the idea of a school prayer amendment is one that is absolutely critical to the reestablishment of a sound value structure in this country. I am extremely sensitive to the need to do this in a way that is fully consistent with the values of our Constitution. Because I believe that the great majority of American people want to achieve this kind of balance. I am confident that a school prayer amendment can work. I do not share the distruct of many opponents of this amendment toward local school boards and decentralized decisionmaking. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me on this extremely important measure. and welcome their thoughts on how we can improve its specific provisions. Madam President. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment. which is very brief. be printed in the RECORD."
980032218,"Mr. President. 1 rise in support of President Reagans foreign policy initiatives in Central America and commend the President on his address last night to a joint session of Congress. In order to prevent further deterioration of the situation in Central America. it is imperative that this additional funding program be approved. We are not merely discussing the future of a small Latin American country. We are debating the security of the entire Western Hemisphere. The Sandinistan victory in Nicaragua clearly strengthened the hopes and the morale of the MarxistLeninists in El Salvador. The defeat of government forces in El Slavador would encourage rebels in Honduras. Guatemala. and Costa Rica. Our lack of action in this matter will undoubtedly lead to a spread of the Communist aggression in Central America. Mr. President. the proposed administration security assistance package is designed to give the Salvadoran military the capability to seize the initiative from the Communist guerrillas. This will allow the government forces to protect the economic Infrastructure of El Salvador and allow the development of that countrys democratic. social. and economic institutions. The program will enhance the mobility of the Salvadoran Armed Forces. It will improve the expansion. maintenance. and modernization capabilities of the army. The program will bring the proportion of Salvadoran soldiers trained by U.S. advisers to over 50 percent. In addition. 25 percent of the funds will be devoted to improving the civic capabilities of the Salvadoran Army. The program will permit the Salvadoran military to reach the people With increased medical and engineering services that directly bN iefit them. in contrast to the hardships that are inflicted upon them by the guerrillas. The most important factor of this entire package is that it will assist the Salvadoran Army in becoming more skilled and. therefore. less dependent on the United States. This will reduce the need for further U.S. aid in this area in the future. Mr. President. the administrations foreign policy initiatives in Central America provide more than military assistance. The program seeks to bolster the economies of this vitally important region. In fact. the proposal outlined by the President last night provides by a 2to1 margin more econotnic aid than military assistance. The administration is committed to a policy which will develop the economies of countries like El Salvador. while stabilizing the political situation there so that free and open democracles can flourish. With respect to Nicaragua. I am confident that our Government is obeying the law. Since the Sandinistas came to power in that country several years ago. the government has become increasingly MarxistLeninist and oppressive in character. In addition. they have exported this violence. oppression. and subversion to their neighbors and have jeopardized the security of the entire region. Our goal with respect to that country should be to support those who seek a peaceful transition toward a free and democratic society. Mr. President. the truth about the situation in Central America needs to be publicized. The Soviets. through their surrogate. Fidel Castro. have been successful in destabilizing that entire section of our hemisphere. By refusing to appropriate an adequate amount of aid for El Salvador. we will actually be acceding to Soviet efforts to dominate Central America. This includes jeopardizing the security of the Panama Canal and the Caribbean Basin. This area is vital to our foreign trade and petroleum interests. and it is the passage through which onehalf of our supplies for NATO would be transported in a European crisis. By approving this security assistance package. we can continue the advancements being made in El Salvador. and we can help preserve a democratic lifestyle for the people of Central AmerIca. If we turn our backs on the peopl of El Salvador and other Central American countries. we do great harm to the future of democracy itself. and we send a disastrous message to friends and foes alike. I hope every Member of the U.S. Congress will support this program. It is a rational. compassionate. and workable solution to the political. social. and economic problems which have devastated Central America for the last several years. Mr. President. I came across an article that appeared in the February 1983 issue of Time magazine entitled ""El Salvador: It Is Not Vietnam."" The article places the Central American situation in its proper perspective. and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD."
980117838,Mr. President. on October 23. 1983. an act of cowardice was callously committed against France and the United States when terrorists blew up two barracks housing Americans and Frenchmen. I would like to express my deep sorrow to the loved ones and friends of Americas sons and those of France. Civ ilized nations view this act with horror and disgust. The intent of the perpetrators is clear: Intimidate the nations involved in the peacekeepng force through such murderous attacks. and public opinion at home will force them to withdraw. The United States. however. must not be so intimidated. The goal of peace and stability in Lebanon is a just goal and we must pursue it with renewed vigor. What sort of world would we have if the United States bowed to the whims of armed lunatics and terrorists? America has lost forever some of the most noble and courageous young men that our Nation can produce. They were all volunteers. men who believed that what this Nation has to offer is worth protecting. even if it means forfeiting their lives so that others may live in peace and freedom. Mr. President. it is left to us as leaders of this Nation to insure that their sacrifice is not in vain. If the United States withdraws. then we have accotmplished nothing. and their sacrifice and devotion to this country and what it stands for. will have been futile. Mr. President. I would also like to note that our distinguished colleague from New Hampshire. Senator GORDON HUMPHREY. was in Beirut when these attacks took place. Senator HUMPHREY aided in the treatment and evacuation of the injured. He even flew to Germany with the most seriously injured giving first aid enroite. Senator HUMPHREY Is to be highly commended for his actions in helping our wounded. We must redouble our efforts to bring peace to this troubled area. There have been few times in history when the preservation of peace was without cost. We have paid once again in lives and blood. Now let us persevere to obtain the peace so many have paid for so dearly.
980131076,"Mr. President. I support H.R. 2230. a bill to extend the life of the Civil Rights Commission. The Civil Rights Commission was created in the 1957 Civil Rights Act. At that time. it was given only a 2year existence. A series of subsequent authorizing legislation has extended the Commission until this year. For several months. the Committee on the Judiciary has had under active consideration various proposals to reauthorize the Commission. These inelude the administrations proposal. which I introduced by request last spring. and a wide variety of permutations of legislation which has been introduced. The qualified nominees sub. mitted by the administration have been simultaneously pending In the committee. We have attempted in good faith to work out an acceptable compromise under which those nominoes could serve on a Civil Rights Commission with an extended life. Mr. President. at no time during the course of those negotiations wa the reauthorization of the Civil Rights Commission In doubt. I have made that intention clear. as have the distinguished majority leader and the chairman of the sub. committee . As recently as last week. thle administration reaffirmed its clear support for the continued existence of that body. Mr. President. with the November 29 deadline looming before us. it is imperative that we act as expeditiously a.:. possible. The Commission must be reauthorized promptly. After surveyng all of the alternatives. I have concluded. along with the administration. the majority leadez and the subcommittee chairman. that the best course of action at this point is to accept the bill passed by the House of Representatives. without change. This will enable us to send legislation to the President for his signature immediately. I see nQ reason for further delay at this point. Trho House bill. H.R. 2230. has two basic features. First. It would extend the life of the Commission for 5 ycars. through September- 30. 1988. This extension is in keeping with those in the past. Second. it would limit thle Presidents removal power so that only removal ""for cause"" would be authorized. This. I believe. addresses the concerns which have been voiced by some of my colleagues. HIR. 2230 was passed by the House with wide. bipartisan support. I understand that an amendment will be offered to this bill which would essentially place the Commission in the legislative branch of the Federal Government. I believe that this course of action would be illadvised in several respects. First. It would further delay this legislation and place us in grave danger of missing the November 29 deadline. Second. there are substantial problems with this alternative. which I will discuss in more detail when it is offered. It Is strongly opposed by the administration and was recently questioned In a Washington Post editorial. Mr. President. in summary. let me emphasize that the continued life of the Civil Rights Commission has had. and continues to have. the support of the administration. myself. and various others on both sides of the aisle. In furtherance of that position. I firmly believe that this body should act promptly and favorably on H.R. 2230. without amendment."
980155392,"Madam President. 8. 52 as reported would make it a Federal offense to carry a firearm during the commission of. or attempt or conspiracy to commit. a Federal or State robbery or burglary. if tho person charged has previously been twice convicted of a Federal or State robbery or burglary. or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense. The new offense would be punishable by a fine of not more than $25.000 and imprisonment of not less than 15 years. Special provisions applicable to this offense would permit danger to the community to be considered in making ball decisions. make the prior convictions a matter solely for the judge before the trial without requiring allegation in the indictment or proof et trial. and require the sentence imposed to be served in full. In addition. the bill contains a general ""intent of Congress"" section that. among other things. indicates tht these offenses ordinarly should be prosecuted by the States and should not be prosecuted federally except at the request or concurrence of State authorities and approval by the Attorney General or his designee. Madam President. as I considered this measure last Congress and again this Congress. I have had strong misgiving. with respect to providing Federal jurisdiction over these essentially State and local offenses based solely on the ""armed career criminal"" aspect of the case. On the other hand. so long as Federal authorities proceed solely at (he request or concurrence of State prosecuting authorities. the Senator from Pennsylvania has made a substantial showing that Federal resources might be helpful in selected cases. It is on this basis that I have supported the bill up to this point. Over the past few weeks. I have talked extensively with responsible officials of the Department of Justice about provisions of the bill designed to give State and local prosecutors a veto power over Federal prosecution of an offense under this section based solely on State law. They have serious constitutional concerns about these provislons and. indeed. might urge a veto unless they are deleted. On the other hand. the National District Attorneys Association and National Association of Attorneys General strongly object to potential Federal jurisdiction of these State offenses without some local veto power. There appears to be no compromise satisfactory to all. Accordingly. I have decided to cosponsor an amendment with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts to limit this career criminal offense to Federal robberies and burglaries. Thus. the enhanced penalties would be available if a person with two prior Federal or State robbery or burglary convictions were charged with a Federal offensefor example. robbery of a federally Insured bank or a post office. Madam President. I know this narrows the substantive reach of the bill to some degree. But it appears necessary to accommodate the responsibility for law enforcement allocated between Federal and State authorities under our Federal system. With this amendment. I hope this bill will pass and be enacted into law. Madam President. if the original amendment of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts had been adoptedand the National Dist ict Attorneys Association and the National Association of Attorneys General favored thata serious constitutional question would have been involved here. In fact. there probably would be a veto. The Justice Department would probably recommend a veto. So the Senator from Massachusetts and I have gotten together to work out a provision that will be approved by the Justice Department and that we think Is reasonable. This new provision will provide a Career Criminal Act at the Federal level. We have no Career Criminal Act now at the Federal level. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania feels that we ought to go ahead and act on this matter as originally contemplated. Since the Justice Department will recommend a veto. we think it is unwise. Here is what the President said in his veto message concerning a crime package that included similar career criminal provisions last Congress. Ills veto message on H.R. 3963 signed on January 14. 1983. reads as follows:"
980165977,Mr. President. we had prayer in the schools from the time that this Government was founded until 1962. No one complained. Everyone acknowledges that it is proper to have prayers. There is nothing in the first amendment that prohibits it. The first amendment establishment clause was merely intended to prevent the creation of a national religion. That is all it was supposed to accomplish. England had a national religion and some other countries did. When this country was founded our forefathers did not want a national religion. On the contrary. they wanted to guarantee the free exercise of religion apart from a national church. I think that the Supreme Court decision handed down in 1962 is ridiculous. That decision should be reversed. When the Supreme Court went into the field of insurance. where they had no authority. the Congress passed a law and took them out of it. They have gone into other fields where they have no authority. Now they have gone into the field of school prayer and incorrectly interpreted the Constitution. We ought to take action today to correct this situation. Congress can control this situation. I do not know that prayers would hurt anybody in school. I want to emphasize that this amendment does not provide for mandatory prayers. It is purely voluntary prayers that are provided for. The United States cannot compose the prayer to be used. A State cannot compose the prayer. The school officials cannot compose the prayer. It Is purely voluntary on the part of the students. Who can object to that? Literary groups meet. athletic groups meet. and other groups meet and. yet. anyone who enters into religion cannot meet. I think that ought to be corrected. We think they ought to be allowed to pray. if they want to pray. Anybody of any religion can get up and pray. This is not a Protestant prayer. this I not a Catholic prayer or a Jewish prayer or any other kind. It just allows a student. if they wish to. to get up and pray. What is wrong with that? After all. every morning when I open this Senate as President pro tempore. the first thing I do is call on a chaplain to pray. If we can open the Senate with prayer. why cannot children in school pray?
980186324,Mr. President. I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution being introduced today by my distinguished colleague from South Carolina. Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President. over the last 2/a decades we have greatly enhanced our ability to predict weather patterns. This enhanced ability is the result of installation of weather radar. the deployment of a satellitebased weather monitoring system. and research efforts. For 26 years now. our weather radar system has served us well. Hardly any one could question the benefits derived from this system since its installation in 1958. However. along with this progress have come technological developments that have made the current weather radar and monitoring system obsolete. Technology exists today that. if utilized. would greatly improve our prediction capabilities. Mr. President. as my distinguished South Carolina colleague has indicated. there is particular concern with regard to our ability to predict socalled stormscale. or mesoscale weather. including tornadoes. downbursts. severe squall or thunder storm lines. raincaused flashfloods. and local heavy snows. I recently had the painful experience of viewing firsthand the massive destruction inflicted upon my home State of South Carolina as a result of a series of tornadoes occurring on March 28. 1084. The loss of life and destruction of property in both South Carolina and North Carolina was devastating. While I am acutely aware of the resulting hardships the citizens of South Carolina have experienced and are still enduring as they attempt to recover from these traumatic events. disasters such as the one that occurred in South Carolina in March are not limited to any one State. They are a national problem and can only be addressed by a concerted national effort. Mr. President. the Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology (STORM) program is designed to increase our knowledge and ability to react to stormscale weather. Once fully implemented. our ability to anticipate. predict. and prepared for dangerous weather conditions should be greatly improved. This concurrent resolution is a step toward implementation of this important program. It expresses the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should take immediate steps to support funding for a STORM program. This is the type of program that is a legitimate function of the Federal Government. The program of predicting stormscale weather is a national problem and one that can only be addressed by a concerted effort by the Federal Government. Much of the technology needed for advancing our current prediction capabilities is available and should be utilized. New technologies for enhancing our capabilities should likewise be developed and deployed. I Join with Senator HOLLINGS in commending this resolution. and the proposed STORM program. to my colleagues.
980273012,"Mr. President. on July 25. 1984. the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided the case of Sedima against Imrex Company. Inc. This particular case involved allegations of business fraud. and the plaintiff therein alleged. among other things. that the defendant had engaged in violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ActRICO. Mr. President. as the Members of the Senate are well aware. enactment of RICO resulted from public and congressional concern about the growing activity or organized crime during the 1950s and 1960s. The act was included as title IX in the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and was designed to assist in the eradication of organized crime in the United States by providing new remedies to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged in such criminal activities. The main part of the RICO statute included a list of predicate offenses which are defined as ""racketeering activity."" The commission of two or more of these predicate acts within a 10year period constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity which triggers the civil remedy claim under 18 U.S.C. 1964(c). Included in the list of predicate offenses are such crimes as murder. extortion. embezzlement. kidnapping. bribery. and other similar hard core criminal acts which the Congress believed to be those most frequently associated with organized crime activity. In addition. when Congress enacted the Organized Crime Control Act. a provision was included in the law which would permit any victim of racketeering to sue in Federal court and recover treble damages and attorneys fees. This private remedy. 18 U.S. Code 1964(c). was included in the law with the intended purpose of creating an incentive for the victims of organized crime activity to bring a private lawsuit to redress the wrongful actions of organized crime against legitimate businesses. Because of the limited resources available to assist in the Governments fight against organized crime. this private. trebledamage remedy was believed to be useful. In brief. the civil RICO part of title IX was crafted to enhance the protection of legitimate businesses against the syndicates infiltration by dealing with the organized crime as an economic phenomenon. Unfortunately. the scope and intent of the RICO provisions have been the subject of widespread uncertainty and discussion in the courts since their enactment. Specifically. courts have wrestled with whether Congress intended to create broad civil causes of action in the legislation or something less. Some court opinions have held that RICOs language is ambigious as it relates to private civil RICO causes of action. Other opinions hold that. on its face. RICO allows for private suits by people injured by defendanta who have committed two socalled predicate acts. Further uncertainty regarding RICO concerns the question of whether a prior criminal conviction is a prerequisite to a civil RICO action. In the Sedima decision. for example. the second circuit court of appeals held that. in order to bring a private civil action. there must first be a criminal S 13350 CO conviction on an underlying predicate offense. Other courts have not required such a conviction as a condition precedent to a private suit. Mr. President. when we acted on this RICO statute as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. I think it is fair to observe that we might not have envisioned the full use of the statute by private civil litigants to include a civil RICO count in their ordinary business litigation alleging misstatements and fraud. In an effort to reach all kinds of racketeering activity. the Congress wrote the statute in broad. sweeping terms. To allege a RICO charge is relatively simple in todays complex. interstate commercial environment. The added appeal of a Federal forum. of a treble damage money recovery. and attorneys fees increases incentives to allege a RICO statute violation in the context of an ordinary commerical law or contract cause of action ordinarily bought in State courts. Mr. President. it would seem from preliminary information coming into my office that a problem may be developing involving the sudden growth of the private suit remedy of the RICO statute. According to the American Bar Associations special RICO task force about 118 private civil RICO cases have been reported in the last 3 years. Of those. the majority alleged securities fraud. commercial fraud. tender offer disputes. and the life. This apparent pattern in current civil RICO use has prompted the American Bar Association to provide a professional education course intitled ""RICO: The Ultimate Weapon in Business and Commercial Litigation."" As a result of the varying judicial interpretations of RICO. numerous questions now exist with respect to legislation which was designed to be a vital addition to our arsenal of weapons against organized crime. These questions and uncertainties have undermined the effectiveness of this weapon and must be resolved. In addition. the members of the accounting. financial. and other business professions in this country deserve to be able to make reasonable judgments concerning the impact of RICO provisions on their business. It is. therefore. Imperative that the Congress hold hearings as soon as possible on this issue to determine if the intention of the Congress in enacting RICO is being carried out. and. if not. what legislative changes are necessary to bring that about. It is my intention to hold such hearings as soon as possible next year after the Congress convenes. I ask unanimous consent that a letter on this subject from Theodore C. Barreaux of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants be inserted in the RECORD."

After earning a bachelor of arts degree in English from the University of South Carolina. Harry Hampton worked as a reporter. columnist. and coeditor for the State newspaper. writing his ""Woods and Water"" column for more than 30 years. In 1931. he helped create the South Carolina Game and Fish Association and was later active in the formation of the States Wildlife and Marine Resources Department. His efforts on behalf of the Congaree Swamp began in 1954. For more than 20 years. Harry Hampton attended meetings. made speeches. wrote articles. and personally escorted people into the swamp to observe and document trees. birds. and other wildlife. Due in part to his efforts. public awareness and support for protecting and preserving the Congaree Swamp rapidly grew. These diligent educational efforts culminated in congressional passage of legislation in 1976 establishing the Congs e Swamp National Monument. I was pleased to author that bill in the Senate and recall that we worked hard to achieve its enactment in the waning days of the 94th Congress. Madam President. it is entirely fitting. that. when completed. the principal visitor center in Congaree Swamp National Monument be named after this man who devoted so much of his life to seeing that this natural area was preserved for the enjoyment of the American people. 8. 1889 was favorably reported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on a vote of 20 yeas to 0 nays. and passed the Senate August 9. 1984. on a unanimous voice vote. The House saw fit to attach amendments to S. 1889 that are unrelated to the naming of the visitor center after this respected South Carolinian. necessitating this further action by the Senate. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senator McCLURE. and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Public Lands and Reserved Water Subcommittee. Senator WALLOP. for their efforts and accommodations in making final action on this measure possible here today."

980004891,"Mr. Speaker. on January 17. 1983. I held a meeting for the farmers of the First District of South Carolina in the town of Walterboro. S.C. Gathered at this occasion were representatives from the Farmers Home Administration. the Small Business Administration. Soil Conservation Service. Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service. the Federal Land Bank and Federal Intermediate Credit Bank. South Carolinas agriculture commissioner. the South Carolina Farm Bureau president. as well as Mr. Wilmer Mizell. Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs at USDA. Also on hand were 400 to 500 farmers who are desperate for some relief to the problems they face. Among the various issues discussed that night was the paymentinkind (PIK) program. Many farmers in my district. as well as across the State. desire to participate in PIK. but for various reasons. which I will mention later. will be limited in their ability to do so. If the goal of the PIK program is to help the farmer by lowering his production costs. and to simultaneously reduce large Government commodit surpluses so as to improve prices. then this program can be improved upon by Incorporating my legislative proposal. My bill would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to include in his final PIK regulations language to allow soybean production to be idled in return for a payment of corn from Government surpluses. My reason for proposing this measure is the knowledge that in my district. the paymentinkind program will not provide significant help as it is currently drafted. My farmers need relief now. but PIK would not help them for two primary reasons. First. farmers in my part of the country double crop. Under the interim rule recommended by the Department of Agriculture. if a farmer idles his corn production. for example. he Is prohibited from planting any other crop on that idled land. even if he normally plants two entirely different crops during a particular year. How is that farmer to be compensated for not growing that second crop? Clearly. it would be folly to alter the rule to permit a second crop to be grown on diverted land. What can help these double cropping farmers is paymentinkind compensation for their second crop. which in my State is primarily soybeans. This would allow. for instance. a farmer in Walterboro. S.C.. to receive paymentinkind for idling his soybean production later in the same year. It is clear that if soybeans are not part of this program. then many of my farmers will be Inclined not to participate in PIK. Second. there are numerous farmers in my State who do not have sufficient yield base histories for the five commodities announced in the iterim PIK rule in order to participate in PIK. Once again. my farmers. who are struggling just as much as those farmers who consistently grow the five PIK program commodities. receive precious little assistance from this Government solution. As a result. I am introducing legislation which will give the farmers of my district and the soybean farmers of this country a helping hand. If passed into law. it would accomplish several objectives. First. it would reduce production of soybeans. There is no significant surplus of soybeans. however. prices are so low now that a farmer cannot earn enough to cover production costs. not to mention covering any loan payments to creditors. Second. it will increase participation in the PIK program. Full and strong participation by Americas farmers is necessary if the program is to work at all. Third. it will enhance the objectives espoused by Secretary Block on January 11. 1983. which are: to reduce productionin corn. wheat. sorghum. rice. and cottonto reduce surplus stock holdings. and to avoid increased budget outlays that would otherwise be necessary under price support programs. In particular. my bill would further reduce the surplus of corn. Furthermore. It will help improve farm prices. which is at the heart of our agricultural economic programs. I invite you to examine this measure and encourage your support. At this point. I include my bill in its entirety in the RECORD: H.R. 1541 A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to revise rules establishing a special program of paymentinkind for acreage diversion for the 1983 crop of certain commodities to permit producers to divert soybean acreage from production and receive corn as paymentinkind Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That (a) the Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ""Secretary"")(1) shall not issue as a final rule the interim rule published in the Federal Register on January 12. 1983 (48 Fed. Reg. 14771479). which establishes a special program of paymentinkind for acreage diversion forthe 1983 crops of wheat. corn. grain sorghum. upland cotton. and rice. unless such final rule incorporates the provisions described in subsection (b). or (2) shall. if such interim rule is issued as a final rul"" before the date of the enactment of this Act. amend such final rule to incorporate such provisions. (b) The provisions referred to in subsection (a) shall provide for the following: (1) The Secretary shall enter into an agreement with any producer with respect to the 1983 crop of soybeans under which(A) such producer agrees(1) to divert from production and devote to conservation uses approved by the Secretary an acreage of cropland equal to not less than 10 percent nor more than 30 percent of the soybean acreage base for such producers farm. and (i) to plant an acreage to soybeans which does not exceed the difference between such soybean acreage base and such diverted acreage of croplatd. and (B) the Secretary agrees to pay to such producer a quantity of corn equal to the product of(1) 2. (it) such diverted acreage of cropland. and (iii) 80 percent of the average yield of soybeans on such farm. as determined by the Secretary. The soybean acreage base for such producers farm shall be equal to the number of acres planted to soybeans on such farm with respect to the 1982 crop of soybeans. (2) In lieu of an agreement under paragraph (1). the Secretary may. pursuant to a competitive bid process. enter into an agreement with such producer with respect to the 1983 crop of soybeans under which(A) such producer agrees(i) to divert from production and devote to such conservation uses an acreage of cropland equal to 100 percent of such soybean acreage base. and (il) to plant no acreage to soybeans. and (B) the Secretary agrees to pay to such producer a quantity of corn equal to the product ofit) 2. (ii) such diverted acreage of cropland. and (iii) the percentage of such average yield which such producer bid for purposes of such competitive bid process. (3) Except as provided in an agreement described in paragraph (1) or (2). no producer shall be readired to divert. setaside. or otherwise reduce. acreage planted to soybeans or to any other commodity as a condition of eligibility for entering into such an agreement. (4) Except when inconsistent with the provisions described in paragraphs (1). (2). and (3). the terms and conditions. procedures. and miscellaneous provisions applicable to contracts. and payments made pursuant to contracts. entered into before the date of the enactment of this Act under the rule described in subsection (a) shall be applicable with respect to agreements described in paragraphs (1) and (2).

980019135,Mr. Speaker. I cannot believe that my Democratic colleagues intend to cripple our efforts to rebuild Americas military strength. Surely they cannot have studied the disastrous provisions contained in the budget crafted by Chairman JONES and his committee. Their budget claims to provide a 4 percent real growth rate for defense spending. That Is lower than the 5 percent rate proposed by President Cartera rate that was itself judged too low by the American people. In fact. the reality of this budget is even worse. What will this budget really represent. both to American jobs and to our deterrent force? Nothing short of complete and unremitting disaster. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that every billion dollars cut from the defense budget costs at least 25.000 Jobs. Other studies put that figure closer to 35.000 jobs. In other words. the Democratic budget for 1984 will cause between 225.000 and 315.000 Americans to lose their jobs. If that were not enough. each billion dollar cut in defense spending will reduce the deficit by only $500 million because we will lose the revenues that would have been generated by that spending. The implications of this budget for our national security are even more ominous. The cuts will fall largely on the modernization and replacement of our weapons. On the average. these cuts will represent 33 percent of those programs. as a result. the committee budget will force the cancellation of the F15 and a reduction in the strength of our combat air wings. It will remove funding needed to continue production of the A6E. the F14. and other aircraft vitally important to our Navy. The Army will be able to procure only twothirds of the combat vehicles that it needs. and the Navy will be forced to cancel production on at least 25 ships. I am appalled by this budgets impact on our national defense. and on the future peace of the world. While the Soviets continue to build a vast military machine. the United States will be forced deeper and deeper into a position of permanent strategic inferiority. I urge the rejecLion of this blueprint for disaster.
980056552,Mr. Chairman. my amendment would add $80.000.000 to the authorization for the MCM1 mine countermeasure ship program to authorize four ships in fiscal year 1984. as requested in the Navys budget. rather than the three ships authorized by the committee. In other words. Mr. Chairman. my amendment would add one ship to the Navys fiscal year 1984 shipbuilding program making the total number of ships authorized 23. as requested by the President. The committee cut the MCM ship for essentially two reasons. One was related to the fact that we had information presented to us which indicated that certain technical and programmatic issues involving design and costs were unresolved. The committee believed that it had chosen a prudent course of action when it decided to slow down procurement because of the uncertainties still outstanding. The other reason related to the House budget resolution. In order to make reductions called for by the House. it was necessary to fVnd places where reductions might be made. The potential problem associated with the MCM ship led the committee logically to its conclusion to delete one of these ships. Since that time. however. several things have occurred which I believe merit reconsideration of the committees action. First. following a review of the Navys MCM ship program by the Secretary of Defense. Secretary Weinberger sent a memorandum to the Secretary of the Navy approving continuation of the MCM program. Subsequently. the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Shipbuilding and Logistics. the Hon. George Sawyer. rescinded a memorandum he had issued withholding award of the second ship pending resolution of the construction issues I mentioned earlier. On May 2. 1983. the Navy awarded the contract for the second MCM to Marionette Marine Corp. in Marinetta. Wis. As I understand the agreement. the ship will be about 7 feet longer in length and cost the Navy an additional .250.000. but that the total cost to the N vy will remain as originally budgeted. The lead ship of this class is currently under construction at Peterson Builders. Inc.. Sturgeon Bay. Wis. To summarise. in my opinion. the basic technical reason the committee cut the MCM ship from the fiscal year 1984 budget is no longer applicable. The related reason. to conform with House directed reductions in the Defense budget may still be applicable. but I am hopeful that the committee will favorably reconsider its action on the MCM ships based on the merits of the urgent need for such ships in the U.S. Navy. The Navy has only three active duty mine warfare ships (MSOs). They are over 30 years old. There are 18 MSOs in the Naval Reserve Fleet. 9 each in the Atlantic and Pacific Fleet. These ships are also over 30 years old. The United States faces a serious threat from mine warfare. Current U.S. mine countermeasure capability is inadequate. obsolete and declining in assets. The large inventory of existing Soviet mines poses a serious threat to U.S. ports and sealanes. The Navys MCM program is the only ongoing U.S. program that is capable of countering the threat. In my opinion. it is national a disgrace that the U.S. Navy had neglected to upgrade its surface ship mine warfare program. Perhaps there exists a ligitimate argument why other programs have deserved a higher priority in the Navys budgets. but I think the time has come to try to make up for a lack of foresight in establishing a better balance of naval forces. I believe that the distinguished chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee will agree with me that our mine countermeasure forces are sadly in need of improvement. And finally. I hope that the Congress will support authorization for the level of the Presidents budget request for this important mine warfare prugram. The threat. as I see. it. Mr. Chairman. is that the Soviet Union possesses a stockpile of mines 10 times larger than that which we have in our stockpile. The Soviets have more than 300 mine warfare ships and we have three. Soviet mine warfare personnel are held in high esteem by Soviet Naval commanders and by the Soviet people themselves. The United States can counter with three active duty minesweepers and 18 reserve minesweepers. the youngest of which is more than 30 years old.
980066730,"Mr. Speaker. I have had the privilege of traveling now with 11 truly dedicated Americans. who happen to be fine representatives of the congressional districts which they represent. I had the privilege of going to a troubled area of this world. Sometimes the unforeseen forces of circumstance often move in strange and awesome ways. At this period in time. in this the last fifth of this 20th century. the unforeseen forces of circumstance has dealt 5 million people in an already overtroubled little nation a very cruel blow. The people of El Salvador are already troubled with poverty. with sickaness. with hunger. with social problems. military problems. They do not need to be the focal point in the Western Hemisphere of whether or not democracy. as we know it and have known it for 207 years. is going to survive. Those brave little people in that struggling minuscule nation have been asked to fight for 225 million Americans our battle for freedom and democracy. And surely as Travis at the Alamo years ago drew a line in the ground with his sword and said. ""Let him who would fight cross over. but him who would live better fly."" The line is being drawn for all of America. be it Central. North or South. in El Salvador. You have heard described to you in far more eloquent terms than I could ever here tonight. tell you of the troubles that beseige these brave people in El Salvador. What we are trying to do is call to the attention of the American people the problems that we as Americans are going to face if we let our neighbors in Central America down. I could not better explain to you the refugee problem we are going to have. the disease. sickness. health. educational problems we dre going to have. employment problems we are going to have. I cannot better describe that to you than has been described by those who preceded me to this podium here tonight. I find it strange that my colleagues over on this side of the aisle impose upon the Government of El Salvador restriction after restriction to receive a few paltry hundred million dollars. In 1961. a Democrat President stood on those steps outside. You remember his inaugural address because you remember the part that said. ""Ask not what your country can do for you. but what you can do for your country."" You know what was said also by that President in that address on that very cold and bleak January morning. he said to the American people and to the world: Let every nation know. every nation. whether it wishes us ill or whether It wishes well that we. the American people. will pay any price. We will bear any burden. we will endure any hardship. we will oppose any foe and we will aid any friend in the defense of liberty and democracy at home and around this world. Has that price now become too expensive when it may be $2 or $300 million? Has it become too expensive when it includes 55 military advisers in our neighboring country of El Salvador? Have we the American people forgotten our heritage. our Continental Congress? Have we forgotten our struggle for democracy? Well. I can only tell you this. that our way of life as we know it. the love of all the great things of America that we hold so dear is now focused in Central America. And as was said by our colleague. it is a youcanpaymenow or paymelater situation. We. your Congress. can decide to aid El Salvador with a few hundred million dollars now in her struggle or we can pay later with hundreds of thousands of American lives when it becomes our struggle. I cannot emphasize enough to my colleagues here in this Congress and to any Ainericans who might be listening the need for this great Nation of ours. the greatest nation in the world. to help a struggling neighbor and an endeared friend. do what we can to see that democracy in Central America. and particulary in El Salvador lives on for generations to come. And as has been said by my colleague. the gentleman from Virginia. it is time the American people had the will and had the resolve not only to aid them through our churches but through our great government. and to say that we are drawing that line. that proverbial line. with our sword in the sand. and saying to Marxists and Communists around this world. ""Communism stops here. we the American people are going to see to.it that communism stops here in El Salvador."" Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues who have not been there to visit that troubled nation. and then you come back and see whether those brave people are not deserving of our help."
980070637,Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman. we have heard a lot of levity here this afternoon. That is mostly what the deuate has been about. One might ask. in the rural areas. who is going to wake up the rooster? Who is going to wake up the farmer? Who is going to make the orange Juice? Who is going to fry the eggs? One might also ask whether. if we really want to save energy. Daddy Sugar or Uncle Sam or the Federal Government has a way to do that. too. We could have a temperaturesaving thermometer. and on days in Washington. D.C.. when we have heat waves like today. we can just say that from March to November we will set the thermometer back 20. and instead of basking in the 97 temperature on the outside. it would be a balmy 77 such as we might find in Florida. That would be saying that we here in Washington have the answers to all the problems for all the country. all the diverse States that make up this Union. The issue that we are debating now is the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana . and that has nothing to do with daylight savings time. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana has a little something to do with what people from my part of the country have for 100 and some odd years called States rights. We have thought. and still think. in some parts of this country that the various legislatures in the respective States might justjust mightin some instances know what is best for their people. All my colleague. the gentleman from Indiana . is asking is that in this one instance. which has nothing to do with human rights or civil rightsand it has nothing to do with voting rightswe recognize that it has to do with whether the various legislatures in their various States know what is best for their people in regard to their agrarian interests. their industrial Interests. or their edicational interests. Or. once again. are we.. the selfappointed righteous leaders of this country assembled in this hallowed Hall. the great decisionmakers and the ones who know what is best for everybody from the Atlantic to the Pacific in our great Nation? So the issue we are debating right now. I would say to the gentleman from the land of the midnight Sun. is not daylight savings time. That comes after this amendment is either passed or defeated. The issue we are debating on this amendment is: Do the Governors of North Dakota and South Dakotaand. by the way. commenting on North Dakota. they say there ar more steers in North Dakota than people. and there is a lot of bull in New York. too. and we should remeniber thatdo the Governors of the respective States and their legislatures in session assembled have the right to decide what is best in the interest of farmers. children. Industrial workers. and others? I do not think there is any question. Mr. Chairman. that that is probably proper in this instance. So the gentleman from Indiana has not offered an amendment that has anything to do with daylight saving time. It goes to the very core of the foundation of this republic. Do the States or do their elected representatives have the right to decide what is best for their people when we are not dealing with the rights of anybody else. human rights. civil rights. voting rights. or any other kind of rights? I submit to the Members that they do. and it is only fair that we allow the various States to decide among themselves or by themselves whether or not they want to subject their people in their locales to an additional hour of darkness or sunlight. whatever the case may be. So. Mr. Chairman. I strongly urge that those Members who really think it is only fair that we put some government back in our Governors and our State legislatures pass the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana and give the States an opportunity to opt out of these two additional months of daylight saving time.
980119928,"Mr. Chairman. this is an amendment which would in effect add one minesweeper. one mine countermeasure ship to the two that the other body is attempting to add. When it came out of our authorization by the Armed Services Committee. this bill contained three mine countermeasure ships. It was reduced by the Appropriations Committee to two. Mr. Chairman. I want to Just take a minute. I realize that a minesweeper is not a romantic ship. It does not win wars. It does not really add significantly to our fleet of offensive weapons. but to me a minesweeper is probably one of the most defensive ships thatthe Navy could possibly have. Mr. Chairman. with the terrorism of today as witnessed in the terrible bombing in Lebanon over the weekend. It would be very easy for terrorists to mine our harbors and .nine our coastal waters. It would be very easy for unfriendly nations to mine our habors and mine our coastal waters by using commercial freighters to lay these mines. using submarines to lay these mines. Mr. Chairman. I think the most significant thing that I can say to my colleagues here in the House is that in our entire fleet. our ever dwindling fleet of naval vessels. we only have three minesweepers. One is stationed In Florida. the Fidelity. and it is used for training. one is in Charleston. S.C.. and one is located on the west coast. Mr. Chairman. we have been told by the Department of Defense and by the Navy that. ""Well. we have other m~thods of sweeping mines. We have helicopters. We have sleds."" Mr. Chairman. in order for helicopters and sleds to be effective. you must control the airspace in the area In which you are trying to sweep. We should witness. If nothing else from the Falkland Islands. the problems that the Argentines and the Brits had. because neither had adequate minesweeping facilities to be sure that t)hose ships would not have been mined as they came and went out of those waters in and around Argentina. I think it is vital to the defense of the fleet which we already have. and as I mentioned to my colleagues the ever dwindling fleet which we already have. to be able to move the fleet if and when the time arises. And. Mr. Chairman. not only under actual mining. but the threat of actual mining. we would paralyze. for a period of time. the entire U.S. Fleet that was located In U.S. ports If we were even threatened that those ports were mined. We would have no way whatsoever of moving that fleet. And I have said repeatedly that If you do not want to authorize and appropriate any more minesweepers. that Is all right. because every ship that we have in our fleet now can act as a minesweeper once. As it goes over a minefield. we will know where the mines are. we will have located them. and wve will have indeed swept them. we will have sent to the bottom of our coastal waters one of our own naval vessels because of our Inability and our lack of desirability in appropriating money to build any more minesweepers. I have been tireless in my efforts. I have been relentless in my efforts to urge this Congress to give us anl adequate number of minesweepers to clear our harbors and to clear our ports in the event they were mined by unfriendly nations or by terrorists. And time and time again. we have moved to the left and moved to the left the number of minesweepers which we presently have. I say to my colleagues that ovecr the next 8year period we will have no longer any minesweepers in our fleet. If we do not modernize that fleet. beginning now. beginning today. with an adequate number of minesweepers. we will have no minesweeping capabilities. The ships that are assigned to the Naval Reserve Fleet now are more than 37 years old and there are 18 of them. We only have three active duty minesweepers to clear all of our home ports. the Straits of Hormuz if they were to be mined. and any other areas in this world. Mr. Chairman. where we might have to move our fleet. I think it is a pitiful shame that we have let what was once a very strong minesweeping force degenerate to such anl insignificant and incapable force of minesweeping. I can only urge this Congress. this committee here today. to amend the amendment of the gentleman from Florida SO as to include an additional $80 millionI know the chairman must be saying. ""When are they going to quite hitting me with these millions of dollars worth of figuires""-io build this much needed and long past due minesweeping."
980200219,Mr. Chairman. my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from Washington. for whom I have a great deal of respectand I do not use that phrase lightly. I really do nothas made all the major arguments for this amendment far more eloquently than I could ever make them. I think that was also echoed by my colleague. the gentlewoman from Ohio. who said that we need these types of protections to keep the President of the United States from dragging us into war. And I say to my friends. if we are sincere. if we are sincere in thinking that this Congress. as my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from Washington. has said. should at least allow 2 hours of debate in this House. the same consideration ought to be given this amendment as should be given to committing combat troops. And I think no argument stronger could be put forward. I think we could consider our troops that are now stationed in Korea and in Western Europe not as combat troops but as a safety patrol. as a group of soldiers who are there to protect our interests but who could not fire hostile fire upon any enemy. even though they are there now. unless the Congress of the United States OKd it. Mr. Chairman. I disagree with this amendment that was just adopted. and I disagree with my own amendment. I have heard. since this campaign was begun. about fairness. Boy. I have heard a lot about fairness on behalf of the Presidential candidates. Lest any of us accuse our President of not being fair. would we be any less fair than ourselves. those of us who point the accusing finger of unfairness at President Reagan. would we be any less fair to our allies anywhere else in the world than we have to our poor little fledgling allies in Central Amerlea? Is there a man or a woman or a gentleman or a gentlewoman in this Chamber who would not vote to do the same thingfor Israel. for Saudi Arabia. for Korea. for Western Europe? Would we treat them any differently. those friends and allies and good buddies of ours. than we would poor little Jose Napoleon Duarte down in El Salvador?
980201358,"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairm.. I had the pleasure of seeing a newly elected President of a democracy come to Washington. and it must have been very impressive for this humble man from humble beginnings and background to come to this awesome city and visit this tremendous big building that stands for freedom and democracy throughout the world. It must have been a very awesome feeling for that man to come all the way from El Salvador and visit this Congress and appear before committees of Congress of which he has read. I am sure. in his native tongue and in his newspapers. all ebout the great Congress of the United States and how they have always been true to their allies and been supportive and helpful to struggling democracies all over the world. One of my colleagues. Mr. Chairman. asked that newly elected President. who is as proud. I am sure. as any man of his country could ever be: ""Mr. President. tell us this: If in fact aid to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters is cut off by some of the more liberal element of our Congress. what than will you and your struggling little democracy do?"" The President looked at the ground and then looked rather hesitatingly at the questioner. and he said. ""You asked me a very difficult question."" He said. ""I would have to reply this way: that if Nicaragua then stepped up its flow of arms into my country. I then would probably have to confront the Nicaraguan Armed Forces myself with my small army. a poorly trained and not very skilled fighting people."" He said. ""Then I wonder what you and your Congress would do because you would have a direct conflict between two nations in Central America. I wonder what then you would do when you compare the military might of Nicaragua with that of my struggling little country of El Salvador."" Well. Mr. Chairman. under this arrendment I tell you what we would do: Absolutely nothing. All of the economic aid which we have sent to Presidentelect Duartes country and all of the military aid which we are going to send to that country would be down the drain because under this amendment. unless my good friends over here and my good colleagues over here were to meet conveniently. as it were. if we were not on a junket in August to China or to T&Jvan. wherever it might be. if it were convenient for us to assemblk here in this building. which I an sure must have been awesomely ber Ltiful to that President of that new uemocracy. we could not act. If we were conveniently able to come back here from a recess or from a Junket or from a trip around the world and vote to stop the slaughter of thousands of Salvadorans. allies of ours. by outside forces. then perhaps we could take action after weeks and weeks and weeks of debate as to whether or not we ought to help an ally with combat troops. Some of those reasons. Mr. Chairman. are the reasons I am opposed to this amendment. I think the Foley amendment which was adopted last night. in the words of my colleague. the gentleman from Illinois. was absolutely stupid. And if that needs to be taken down. I am sorry. I think his words were dumb. I think it was a dumb amendment. hastily acted on by a Congress which was not thinking clearly last night. For those reasons. Mr. Chairman. I am opposed to the Campbell amendmcnt. and I urge my colleagues to vote against it."
980201570,Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the last word and I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. r know the gentleman from New York to be a terrific advocate of religious rights and certainly a big supporter of the first amendment of the Constitution. Mr. Chairman. there are some of us who believe we have almost disarmed our Armed Forces and now we want to undress them. You know. one of the great things about service in the military of the United States. and I think in any. is the pride we take in our units. the pride we take in our uniform. the pride we take in being able to be representative of a country where we as a nation have always been a multiplicity of people who have been melted into one pot and all call ourselves Americans. I really see a dangerous precedent. I would say to the gentleman from New York who as I say. is a great advocate of religious freedom. in putting into legislation the right for our armed services to wear religious headgears of their choosing even if it were not in any way obtrusive to the uniform of our Nation. I can see young women who may be in our Armed Forces. who may be nuns or something. wearing headgear of a religious order. I can just see this opening a door that we really do not need to open in the uniformed services of our country and I would not want to deny anyone the right to practice openly or covertly their religious beliefs and I certainly will not want to cause them from wearing any type of religious regalia that would indicate outwardly the pride that they have in their religion and their beliefs but I really think. Mr. Chairman. that for this Congress to write into law that our military services. while on duty. can wear religious headgear of their choosing if it is not obtrusive. I would ask rhetorically maybe. would a man who is on deck. on watch. the deck of a ship at night. or during the day would he be permitted to wear religious headgear of his choosing. when obviously a yarmulke would be hidden by a combat helmet. I suppose. But what about the little overseas cap that the service personnel wear at home and abroad? Would it not be uniform. the fact that everything about the military services tends to be uniform that I really think it is asking an awful lot to permit. to write into law the permission where we could grant permission to our members of the Armed Forces to wear religious headgear. I do not know whether the gentleman from Texas was tongueincheek asking about a war bonnet. I assume that he was. But I can see it expanding to these types of things in the years ahead. I really think that when you go into the Armed Forces of the United States or of any country. it is discipline. it is uniformity. and surely it is sacrifice. But I do not think that any member of any religious order to be true to his faith or true to his God or true to his beliefs has to outwardly wear during duty hours headgear. even though it might be unobtrusive. For that reason. Mr. Chairman. I am very sorry to have to look as though I am antiSemitic. antiIndian or antianything. because I do not advocate the wearing. while wearing a military uniform. of a religious headgear. I really do not think it is in order for the Congress of the United States to write into law permission for members of its armed services to wear religious headgear while on active duty. For that reason. Mr. Chairman. I am opposed to the amendment and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.
980230751,"Mr. Speaker. I wish to express my appreciation to the ranking member. the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding these few minutes to me in regard to this rule. Mr. Speaker. this is a closed rule. one that I time and time again have voted against and many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have also. I realize that it is the 59th minute of the 11th hour as far as our national conventions are concerned and that time is upon us. But. Mr. Speaker. I Lhink it is terribly unfair for the major political parties of this country to come to the Congress of the United States and ask us to contribute additional funds to those already contributed for the operation of their conventions this summer. It is a bad precedent for this Congress to set. Any major city in this June 2.9. 1.984 II7.157 country wkishing to hav- a major convent lon could feel that this is a precedent Ih at would allow them I.ooome to t his Cogriess and ask for funds for that convention. especially if there were going to be any questions of security of any kind Involved. It Is no wonder. Mr. Speaker. that we. the Congress of the United States. canniot operate fiscally responsible or with any type (if fiscal restraint at all when we even have deficits for our naLional partle. conventions. We have an openi cleckbook you might say to run these coniventions. We come back lime and time again and the Congress balls out the political parties and gives 1.than additional funds. I want. my colleagues to know. Mr. Speaker. that. I think this i about $2 millon more for each political party. True. it is a paltry sum compared to those awesoile deficits which we. an a Congress. permit this country to operate under. but I just Utink it is terribly unfair for the Rules Committee to present us with a closed rule. as short as the time is. a rule that allows no mutiendnents. no points of order. I think it is very improper for te major political parties of this country to come to the Congress and ask for additional funds to operate their political conventions. which Is really a party matter and It is a bad precedent to be set by this Congress. I urge a ""no"" vote against the rule."

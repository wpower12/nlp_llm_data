980003644,Mr. Speaker. McKean County. Pa.. is sometimes referred to as the coldest spot in the free world. It should. therefore. come as no surprise that with McKean County in the district I represent. I am extremely concerned about the steep increases in natural gas prices. Mr. Speaker. our Founding Fathers believed that Members of the House of Representatives should be elected every 2 years. They reached this conclusion because they believed that the House of Representatives should be responsive to the will of the people. I believe we are about to test the responsiveness of this body to the will of the people. It is indeed impossible to explain to constituents why gas prices have shot upward even though supplies of gas have increased while demand has slipped due to conservation efforts and the recession. The only reason I can give is that legislation passed by Congress in 1978 has defied the principles of supply and demand. That is an honest. straightforward answer. But it is not the sort of responsive answer that I want to give to constituents facing the hardship of a 25percent increase in their gas bill. I just received petitions more than an inch thick from constituents concerned about natural gas prices. I do not want to tell these people why their gas bills have shot through the roof. I want to tell them what Congress is going to do to correct the situation. As a member of the NortheastMidwest Congressional Coalition. I strongly support H.R. 873. the Temporary Natural Gas Market Correction Act of 1983. This bill requires natural gas pipeline companies to adjust the volume and mix of gas within their systems to provide the lowest price gas possible to their distribution companies. It also gives pipeline companies the contractual authority to refuse high priced gas if less expensive gas is available under current contracts. Admittedly. H.R. 873 only attempts to address the shortterm problem of severe price increases. But I think it is much better for Congress to attack this problem immediately and not hide behind statements that natural gas pricing is hopelessly complex and we cannot do anything about it right away. Sure. it is complex and we will have to deal with the longterm problems of natural gas pricing through lengthy debate. And I do stand ready to take part in reaching longterm policies to address this crucial energy issue. But in the meantime. we must do something now to protect consumers hit hard by these price increases. and I urge my colleagues to join me in pushing for passage of this legislation.e
980009070,I thank my chairman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. while the bill we have before us today represents an improvementalbeit a modest oneover the socalled jobs bill we considered during the lameduck session it still leaves a great deal to be desired. Last years $5.4 billion bill contained a huge $1 billion emergency makework jobs provision. It was my experience as Chief Counsel of the Economic Development Administration that such efforts have been tried and failed. The cost per job was too high. a new bureaucracy needed to be created. and the program was fully implemented only long after the recession had ended. There are some provisions of this bill that are worthy of supportindeed the supplement of $5 billion for unemployment compensation benefits for those who have exhausted their sole means of support short of public welfare assistancecries out of our support. I am also pleased to see $200 million included for the economic development administrations traditional programs. Because of the failure of EDA to obligate funds for projects which are ready to go to construction. there are a great many of such projects in the pipeline which could be gotten underway immediately. But as reported from committee H.R. 1718 contains many. many offensive aspects. I am particularly offended by the public works components in the bill. I am a member of the Republican Jobs Task Force which drew up a number of standards on principles by which to judge any jobs proposal. Those six basic principles are: First. The utilization of existing programs and projects to best serve the immediate employment needs of the Nation. Second. The adherence to the basic spending limitations recommended by the administration in order to minimize any adverse impact on current deficit projections and interest rates. Third. The selection of public works projects that will enhance national productivity or directly address the problems of a neglected national infrastructure in those areas where these problems are the most severe. Fourth. The selection of public works projects that are the most labor intensive. Fifth. The selection of projects. with the exception of those meeting the criteria of No. 3. located in urban and rural areas of high unemployment. and Sixth. The special consideration of the employment needs of women and youth in the implementation of programs and projects funded under emergency jobs legislation. The public works portions of this bill fall to satisfy almost all of these principles. Too many of these projects will not get underway until too late. They will help balloon the deficit because substantial amounts of new money are authorized. There is no effort made to insure that the most labor intensive projects are funded. But by far the most egregiously offensive aspect is the blatant pork barrel approach. The Republican Jobs Task Force recommended that public works projects should be targeted on neglected Infrastructures in areas of highest unemployment. The only areas that are targeted in this bill are the congressional districts of members of the Appropriations Committee. In the designation of specific projects for highway demonstrations. for mass transit. for Amtrak. and rumor has it. for flood protection there is no consideration given as to the unemployment rates in those areas. Are these really the areas that are really the most distressed and deserving of our largess. We do not know but I doubt. There Is also no evidence that these projects are the most needed when compared with competing projects from other areas. That is why I believe that we must correct this critical defect in this bill by passing the amendment that will be offered by Mr. EDGAR. This amendment will Insure not only that the money is equitably distributed but that it Is distributed to areas of greatest needthose with the highest unemployment. If we are going to have a jobs billlet us at least put the money where the jobs are desperately needed.
980081162,"Mr. Speaker. I am especially pleased and privileged today to take this special order so that my colleagues and I may pay tribute to General E. C.. known as ""Shy"" Meyer. who recently retired as the U.S. Army Chief of Staff. General Meyers long and very distinguished career began in the Army in 1951. He was graduated from West Point in that year. and served as an infantry officer during the conflict in Korea. He won his second Silver Star for bravery in Vietnam. and returning stateside. displayed his brilliance as a strategic planner at the Brookings Institution. In addition. he has served as Commanding General of the 3d Infantry Division (Mechanized. in Europe. and as Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the Pentagon. At age 50. General Meyer at that time was one of the Armys youngest senior generals. He was chosen to succeed Gen. Bernard Rogers as the Armys Chief of Staff in the year 1979. General Meyers tenure as Army Chief of Staff. I think. has coincided with a significant and positive shift in Americas perceptions of its defense requirements. I believe that much of the credit for this shift must go to General Meyer for his emphasis on the fundamentals of a viable Army that our Nation needs to meet the challenges of the decades ahead. I would emphasize particularly his emphasis on the need to develop a global strategy before deciding what weapons systems we need to implement that strategy. He recognized the need not only to make the case with the Congress and the people of this country that there was a need for a global strategy. which then would be implemented by the appropriate weapons systems. So I think to his credit. he put great emphasis on the importance of developing a coherent and viable strategy worldwide. and into that strategy he then was able to make the determination of the kind of organization needed to implement the strategy. the kind of training of the men and women of the Army needed to implement that strategy. the kind of logistic support and the kind of mobilization. not to mention the specific weapons systems that- were needed in order to implement that strategy. I think this represented a major change in military thinking in this country. It goes without saying. I believe. that General Meyer has raised the standards of excellence of the U.S. Army. and rekindled its esprit de corps. Yet the most important legacy. and I think challenge. which I think he leaves for us to uphold is his very strong belief that there must be a clear link between the people of this country and its Army. or to quote General Meyer himself. ""Soldiers should not go off to war without having the Nation behind them."" and I think this is an enormously important point. We cannot have an effective military operation. we can certainly not have an effective Army. unless the people are willing to support that Army. It has been my very good fortune that ""Shy"" Meyer was born and raised in St. Marys. Pa.. which I have the honor to represent in Congress. I have to say that I have enjoyed immensely and have profited immensely from my association with him during my tenure in this body. and I have seen first hand his commitment and his dedication as an individual to the individuals. to the men and women of the Army that he has commanded. and to the Nation that he has served. I would like to share just one reminiscence of my acquaintance with General Meyer. Shortly after he was named Army Chief of Staff. I sent him a congratulatory letter wishing him well in his new assignment. and inquiring if he had an opportunity to spend any time in his home town of St. Marys. He was quick to respond with a reply and informed me that he had been back to St. Marys for a brief visit. I have to say that the General is an avid hunter. and the visit to his home town included a day of deer hunting. In his letter to me. he indicated that the Nations military preparedness was in a frightful state because the Army Chief of Staff had missed an easy shot at a buck. and he said he did not stand very well for the marksmanship of the U.S. Army. . His nickname. ""Shy"" Meyer. I think is a misnomer because I never found him to be the least bit shy about bringing to my attention and to the attention of my collegues in the Congress the needs that he felt so strongly about for the U.S. Army. He was always most eloquent and most articulate in presenting those needs and in backing up those needs. So I think that shyness was not the hallmark of his tenure as the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. On behalf of the Borough of St. Marys from which he comes. from the Nation. and from myself. I think I would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to an outstanding general and to a great man who has served his country well. At this time. Mr. Speaker. I would yield to my colleagues. the gentleman from Pennsylvania ."
980095281,"Mr. Chairman. we are approaching the end of the debate period on this very important bill and we have heard a lot of discussion about water rights. and unemployment issues. take or pay contracts. environmental concerns. and all of these are going to be debated at length. I am sure. under the 5minute rule. But for me. the issue really comes down to this. and the reason that I support the coal slurry legislation Is because I think on the issue of fairness it is abundantly clear that this Is legislation that has been delayed too long and really d~serves to see the light of day. I think it is intrinsically unfair. Mr. Chairman. for one mode of transportation. the railroads. which have a near monopoly on the transportation of coal in this country. to arbitrarily block. and let us make no mistake about it. it is solely the railroads that .have blocked the development of coal slurry pipelines In this country. It Is intrinsically unfair for them to exercise the club which they have to prevent the development of a competitive mode of transportation. Competition. after all. in the marketplace in this country has been the driving force behind the development of this country in so many other fields. It allows the entrepreneurs of our society to flourish by developing and marketing new products and services. But in the coal transportation market there Is not much competition because. quite frankly. most of our Nations coal production Is transported by railroads. Trucks. sure. for the short hauls. while barges are useful in some areas where convenient water systems are available. But for the last 20 years the Congress has debated the merits of the fourth alternative. coal slurry pipelines. and has reached no resolution solely because of the opposition of railroads in this body. Since the 19th century railroads have enjoyed this near monoply and they had the right of eminent domain when they were developed and they have used that ownership to thwart the construction of coal slurry pipelines. The railroad industry argues that. coal slurry pipelines will result In massive unemployment as their historic markets are captured by a cheaper mode of transportation. It Is interesting to me that the only time we have really come Into competition. that is where railroads have been In direct competition with coal slurry pipelines. it was the coal slurry pipeline that was shut down. So I do not really feel that it Is a valid argument to suggest. that in every event railroads are going to suffer as a result of the competition of coal slurry pipelines. No. Mr. Chairman. it seems to me that in every other area of endeavor in this country we permit. we encourage competition. There is no reason for any difference in the method of transportation of coal and. therefore. Mr. Chairman. I would most strongly urge a favorable vote on coal slurry pipeline by the House. Mr. Chairman. competition in the marketplace has been the driving force behind our Nations No. 1 position In the world economy. It allows the entrepreneurs of our society to flourish by developing and marketing new products and services. In the coal transportation market. there is not much compietition because most of our Nations coal production is transported by railroads. Trucks are used for short hauls while barges are advantageous where a convenient water system is available. For the last 20 years. Congress has debated the merits of a fourth alternative. coal slurry pipelines. Since the 19th century. railroads have enjoyed the right of eminent domain and they have used their ownership of rightsofway to thwart the construction of -coal slurry pipelines. The railroad industry argues that coal slurry pipelines will result in massive unemployment as their historic markets are captured by a cheaper mode of transportation. Yet. several studies predict greater domestic and International coal consumption. The increased demand for coal cannot be met by our railroads alone. We must provide for modern means of transportifig coal In order to meet future demand. This capacity cannot be built overnight without overcoming the .legal monopoly that only railroads enjoy by restoring fair play in the marketplace. Furthermore. the Interstate Cornmerce Commission must under this bill. make a determination during the certification process ""on the extent to which the proposed pipeline or extension would have an economic impact on any other common carrier or would affect the type or level of transportation services of any other common carrier."" In other words. this provision is an Important requirement In determining whether or not the proposed pipeline or extension is or will be required by the present or future pilbllc convenience and necessity before the right of eminent domain Is granted to coal slurry pipelines at the expense of railroad Interests."
980128593,I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Chairman. I rise today to speak in support of the small. familyowned daiy farm whose concerns I do not believe have been addressed completely either in the compromise bill and certainly not in the Conable substitute. Mr. Chairman. for the past 3 years. Congress has grappled with the dairy pricesupport program. We are now faced with a steadily mounting dairy surplus and urgentlyI submit urgentlyneed to enact legislation which will bring milk production back Intoo balance with consumption. assure consumers of continued dependable supplies of milk and achieve substantial budget savings. I support much of what Is embodied in H.R. 4196. especially the program offering dairy farmers strong Individual incentives to reduce production. I firmly believe that the top priority of any dairy legislation must be to reduce the nearly 20 billion pounds of dairy surplus aind the enormous costs to the Government of purchasing and storing that surplus. something in the neighborhood of $17 per hundredweight. However. I have to say that after witnessing firsthand this weekend the continuing debacle of our present $1 per hundredweight dairy assessment. I must disagree with the provision in H.R. 4196 that makes mandatory another 50 cents per hundredweight assessment. My concern Is that the present assessment program. which became effective last April. has not been effective in reducing milk production. If anything. the assessment Is forcing many dairy farm families to make increases in their milk production to offset cashflow lossesthereby. increasing our dairy surplus. I am especially concerned about small dairy farmers who have not been able to Increase production and who are currently operating on a razorthin margin. It is these small dairy farmers who have and will suffer the brunt of any assessment. but these small dairy farmers did not create the surplus nightmare. When the opportunity arises. I plan to Introduce an amendment to K.R. 4196 which would make the 50 cents per hundredweight assessment only applicable to those farmers who increase dairy production as determined by their marketing history. I am convinced that the 50 cents per hundredweight assessment should be used as a penalty to make It finanrially unattractive to overproduce milk. Otherwise. I am afraid we only succeed in reducing milk production by forcing small dairy farmers out of business and. again I must emphasize. they did not create the surplus nightmare. I urge my colleagues to listen carefully to debate on this important legislation and to support measures which are fair and equitable.
980184803,"I thank the gentleman from Alaska for yielding this time to me. Mr. Speaker. as the elected Representative of the four counties that Include the only national forest In Pennsylvannia. I have a particular interest in Federal legislation affecting my constituents. The boundaries of the Allegheny National Forest include 750.000 acres of natural black cherry. oak. ash. and other commercial hardwoods that are used in fine furniture. both domestically and abroad. Oil and gas wells on the forest produce highviscosity. lowsulfur crude oil that is primarily refined Into lubricants for the motoring public. Deerherds abound. with wild turkey. bear and elk species making a comeback. The Kinzua Dam. which hold back the Allegheny Reservoir. acts as a flood control project north of Pittsburgh. These benefits are shared by many who wish to pass this legacy and heritage on to future generations. I wish to thank the gentleman from Ohio for his patience while this lengthy process took place. You have been most helpful in clarifying and assuring me over the concerns raised by the people of Pennsylvania over the intent of the legislation. Moreover. the entire Pennsylvania delegation has cosponsored H.R. 5076 and both the senior and junior Members. of the other body have introduced companion legislation that is identical to H.R. 5076. The expeditious treatment by the House Interior Committee enhances the likelihood of enactment into law in the short time period that remains in the 98th Congress. Let me also take this opportunity to express my appreciation to my colleagues from the Pennsylvania delegation who serve on the Interior Committee. The gentleman from Pennsylvania was especially helpful In coordinating the views and positions of major environmental groups. I realize that for both Members. this bill falls short of their desires for larger wilderness acreage designations. If I had a free hand in drafting the bill. it would contain smaller areas. No one who has worked closely on the bill is entirely pleased with its results. the test of any good compromise. I have studied this issue for 6 years and I can tell you that this bill is. neither a complete victory nor defeat for one special interest. The proposal is fair. feasible. and realistic. The Pennsylvania Wilderness Act provides for two landuse designations of various areas in the Allegheny Na. tional Forest. based upon the surveys of potential wilderness areas in the roadless area review and evaluation II (RARE II). The act designates seven islands on the Allegheny River as the Allegheny Islands Wilderness (363 acres) and a much larger plateau section of northern hardwoods called the Hickory Creek Wilderness Area (9.337 acres). The bill also creates an Allegheny National Recreation Area (23.100 acres) which is comprised for areas identified. and generally depicted in RARE II. as Cornplanter. Tracy Ridge and Allegheny Front. The northern part of the Allegheny Reservoir in the Allegheny National Forest is also Included in the National Recreation Area. Special provisions have been drafted into the legislation to deal with the problem of oil. gas and mineral (OGM) rights beneath RARE II areas by private owners. The problem of ownership by split estates is not unique to the Allegheny National Forest. many national forest were first established in the Eastern United States by the acquisition of only surface rights by the Federal Government. Because wilderness. by its very definition. is an area ""substantially untouched by mankind."" there should be reasonable assurances that a wilderness designation will protect these values now anc( in the foreseeable future. One of the major misconceptions about the Pennsylvania Wilderness Act is that the bill would open forest areas to oil and gas drilling for the first time. Private individuals and firms own around 98 percent of the subsurface mineral rights in the Allegheny National Forest. It Is their inherent fifth amendment right that ""No person shall . . . be deprived of life. liberty. or property. without due process of law. nor shall private property be taken for public use. without just compensation."" The Federal Government cannot block oil and gas development by private concerns throughout most of the Allegheny National Forest. Few people realize that oil and gas drilling has taken place throughout the region. and including the Allegheny National Forest. for over 125 years. The first oil well in the world was discovered just a few miles from the forest boundary. Some of these wells have produced oil and gas for 50 years or more. Under this bill. the Secretary of Agriculture would be empowered to exercise stricter control over oil and gas operations in the designated areas. The new rules and regulatory authority could result in higher costs in the exploration of oil and gas resources. However. the Secretary could not impose such onerous requirements that oil and gas development is economically infeasible and therefore. a violation of the fifth amendment rights of private subsurface mineral holdings. The bill authorizes a modest sum. $2 million. to acquire the OGM rights beneath Hickory Creek. All subsurface rights beneath the Allegheny Islands are already owned by the Federal Government. Consolidating the split ownership of both the surface and subsurface rights will greatly alleviate the burdens upon the Forest Service in administering Hickory Creek in accordance with the objectives and purpose of the Wilderness Act. Other RARE II areas have been touted for wilderness designation in the past. However. sufficient revenues are not available to purchase OGM rights with the consent of the owners. This legislation proposes an alternative land use designation for three areas surveyed under RARE II and part of the Allegheny Reservoir by the establishment of an Allegheny National Recreation Area. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to formulate management plans for the Allegheny National Recreation Area that maximize recreation opportunities and protect fish. wildlife. and water quality values. At the same time. oil and gas exploration and development may take place in a manner that is consistent with the preservation of recreational values. The committee report addresses two concerns that were brought to my attention by my constituents. The first concern Involves timber management and recovery on wilderness areas and NRAs. It is my understanding that the Wilderness Act permits timber recovery in the case of insects. disease. and forest fires. NRA designation permits even broader forestry practices in that current statutory laws and regulations governing recoverable resources apply to timber management. The second concern is trapping. The bill permits trapping in wilderness areas and the Allegheny National Recreation Area when in accordance with State fish and wildlife rules and regulations. Many wilderness bills have not been enacted into law in this Congress because the two bodies have differed over the release language prov!lon. The Pentsylvania Wilderness Act. as introduced. did not address this particular question but left its resolution to the respective committees of the House and Senate. The legislation. as introduced. was sufficiently perfected to meet the concerns of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without further delay over the release language question. Prompt passage of the Pennsylvania Wilderness Act is necessary if the longterm management of the Allegheny National Forest is to continue without serious ramifications. because of delays over congressional inaction. This bill was amended in committee to include ""soft release"" language that gives greater certainty over when the Forest Service and the Congress can consider future areas for wilderness designation. I reluctantly accept the committees decision because coherent and comprehensive forest management planning requires a degree of certainty today. and in order to avoid serious and undesirable consequences in the future. The only other alternative was the status quoand that is unacceptable. Enactment of H.R. 5076 will provide this critical certainty and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill."
980188054,I thank the gentleman from Missouri very much for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I would just like to carry on with detailing some of the events. some of the acts of terrorism that have occurred. I think the point we are making here is that this is not some recent or limited activity. This has been going on over a long period of time. I think. Mr. Speaker. I would just once like to have those who have opposed the administrations policies in El Salvador to tell us exactly what they would do and how things could be better for the people of El Salvador in specific terms rather than in generalized rhetoric. As we have heard from the previous speakers. my colleagues who spoke earlier. bombs and murder and terrorism are useful and frequent tools of the FMLM. I have documented evidence of additional acts of terrorism. more killings and bombings by the FMLN which I am going to read into the RECORD in just one moment. But the point. I think. that we are trying to make. Mr. Speaker. is that we have got to really try to bring a balance to the discussions of our debate over El Salvador. which is heated and emotional. The focus I think is too often on the problems which the current government. and never mind what current government. never mind the realities of the existing situation. but substituting one government that must answer to us. or that does answer to us. for another that listens only to the Soviet Union is certainly not going to help the United States. And. more importantly. It is certainly not going to help the average citizen in El Salvador. Mr. Speaker. I deal a lot with economic development in this body and I am very sensitive to the direct connection that exists between the quality and extent of our infrastructure. highways. bridges. power stations. et cetera. and the ability of a society to have economic growth. to create jobs and grow. There is a very direct linkage between the quality of that infrastructure and the ability to have economic growth. And one of the greatest tragedies tbitt I have perceived in El Salvador Is that we are destroying the economic infrastructure that makes any kind of economic growth possible in that country. We have seen a sustained. systematic campaign to make it impossible for economic growth to take place. And it just seems to me that it is very deliberate. and those that say that the problem in Central America. and specifically in El Salvador. is not a military problem but is one of poverty. that is true. Poverty is a very real factor that the Communist MarxistsLeninists are counting on to bring themselves to power. And they are making It almost impossible for any other kind of regime to succeed. So I think that from my point of view the most really reprehensible thing they are doing there is to destroy the ability of that country to grow. But let me just mention that perhaps one of the best examples of that was on February 6 of 1981 when a high powered bomb explosion destroyed the Delfrio Bridge and damaged the national electric power station and left the entire eastern part of El Salvador without i.wer. and that was reported in ACAN. Panama City. on February 6. 1981. And this. as you have heard other speakers say. was not an isolated incident. They have made a point of targeting those power stations and infrastructure that would make it impossible for growth to take place. On November 3. 1981. an international fair manager was killed by Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front members as he was traveling in downtown San Salvador toward the fairgrounds. That is reported by Radio Cadena YSKL. San Salvador on November 3. 1980. On October 10. 1980. the secretary of the executive committee of the party. Melvin Rigoberto Orellana was assassinated by terrorists identified as belonging to the Parabundo Marti Popular Liberation Front. And on July 3. 1980. the Peoples Revolutionary Army claimed support for the murder of members of the Nationalist Conciliation Party. Nationalist Democratic Organization. and the local commanders in Morazan and San Miguel. again reported by Radio Cadena Central. in San Salvador on Then on June 23. 1980. 215 persons were threatened with death. This was threatened by the ultra leftist armed forces of National Resistance. who released a list of threatened which included three former presidents of El Salvador: Fidel Sanchez Hernandez. Arturo Armando Molina. and Carlos Humberto Romero. as well as junta members Napoleon Durate and Antonia Morales Erlich. and on April 14. 1980. the guerrillas occupied Soyanpango. near San Salvador in clashes with the army troops at the time Mayor Jose Estrada Mayorga was caught in the crossfire and killed. On April 1. 1980. the Quatemalan Ambassador. Carlos Lemus Gallardo. was attacked in front of the Salvadoran high school. and the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers claimed responsibility as reported again by the French Press Agency on February 14. 1980. leftwing militants took over the office of the Agriculture and Livestock Development Bank. 600 employees were taken hostage by the Salvadoran Christian Yeasants Federation and the Farmworkers Union. both belonging to the Peoples Revolutionary Party. as reported in ACAN in Panama City. On November 28. Mr. Speaker. Jose Guzman. former mayor of San Martin. was machinegunned to death by Farabundo Marti Popular Liberation Forces as he was driving toward San Salvador with his 13yearold son. who was slightly injured. Mr. Speaker. this is a litany of terror. or horror. of murder that is too long. far too long. but I think it is extremely important that we present this litany. that we detail these events which. as the gentleman from Missouri has pointed out. have taken place over not 6 months. 1 year. but over a 5year period. And I think that it is incumbent upon us to attempt to redress the balance here. that this is a situation where we have seen systematic. deliberate. ongoing acts of terrorism to try to disrupt and overturn the Government in El Salvador. So I would just like to add my commendation to the gentleman from Missouri for bringing this special order in order that we may put Into the RECORD some of these events which are so tragic.
980192620,"I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Speaker. I would ask my colleagues to suspend disbelief for a moment and pretend that I am ""Mr. Rogers."" and that this is Mr. Rogers neighborhood and that I am about to give you that word for the day. Boys and girls. the word for the day is ""infrastructure."" Infrastructure is not a word like charge. or excelsior. or. heaven knows. commandante. or deficit. It is not a word that really gets the visceral juices flowing. In fact. it is a word that tends to make peoples eyes glaze over. It is really a word that has given new meaning to the concept of boredom. I give speeches. I would tell my colleagues. on infrastructure all the time. and I can tell you that people get bored almost immediately when you start talking about infrastructure. You mentioned infrastructure once. and half your audience gets up for coffee. leaves the room for coffee. Mertion it twice. and their eyes roll up in their heads and a majority fall off their chairs. So it is not the sort of an issue that really is going to galvanize this body. I suspect. But I think there is a need to humanize infrastructure. What are we really talking about? I think the objective here is to put it into personal terms. So let me. tell you that what we are really talking about is about you breaking an axle when you hit a pothole going over the 14th Street Bridge. It is about you trying to take a bath and finding sewage backed up in your bathtub. It is about the mayor of any one of 50 percent of the communities in this country. let us take Paducah. Ky.. that has a hot prospect for a new industry to come Into that town. into Paducah. and is told that he cannot have them come. in because he is at capacity as far as his waste water treatment system is concerned. It is about the facts. my colleagues. that all of our public facilitiesbridges. highways. ports. port facilities. sewage facilities. water systemsare all wearing out faster than weand by ""we"" I mean Federal. State. local. and indeed private sectorare replacing or repairing those facilities. And it is about this bill. Mr. Speaker. This bill is a modest start toward identifying the magnitude of the problem that we are facyd with and beginning to sort out the responsibility for how to address this enormous problem. I would soon use all of my time. Mr. Speaker. If I were to thank all of the people who have worked toward this day. but I have to single out a special few. Probably the genesis for today rose from a book called ""American Ruins"" by Pat Choate and Susan Walters. who really first identified what we are talking about and issued a clarion call for a Federal capital budget. My chairman. the gentleman from Minnesota"
980207744,Mr. Chairman. although teenagers comprise only a small percentage of the driving population. the increasing number of alcoholrelated deaths that teenaged drivers are Involved in Is horrifying. During this season of proms and graduation celebrations. I feel that it is necessary and appropriate to focus attention on this problem that impacts our teenagers not only on the highways. but in our homes. schools. and workplaces. Indeed. alcohol abuse threatens the very quality of life in this country. Clearly. a bold new initiative is needed to form public policy on alcohol abuse in America. A first step toward this goal can be found in legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague and chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee. Mr. HOWARD. This legislation. of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. encourages States to adopt a minimum drinking age of 21 by using Federal highway funds as leverage. 5 percent of a States annual highway apportionment for fiscal year 1986 will be withheld from States which do not adopt the age 21 drinking age requirement. 10 percent of the apportionment in fiscal year 1987 will be withheld if that State still fails to comply. Enactment of this legislation will not only reduce the number of deaths resulting from drunk driving. it will demonstrate to young people that alcohol is a potentially dangerous drug that is neither glamorous nor heal1thy. More important. such a policy will serve as a catalyst for all sectors of the communityfamilies. schools. churches. media. businessesto get involved in the development of a strategy to prevent alcoholism and alcoholrelated problems. This strategy should consider the pervasive influence of advertising in our daily lives. the important role of education. and the importance of the Federal Government in guiding policy on this issue. Mr. Chairman. it is time for the Federal Government to take some responsibility for remedying the problem of drunk driving and the larger problem of alcohol abuse. the Howard bill is a logical and reasonable start.*
980272751,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding and would like to add my commendations to the gentleman from Washington for bringing this special order in honor of a good friend of all of us. JOEL. PRITCHARD. Mr. Speaker. I have gotten to know JOEL- well over the last 6 years. and like all of my colleagues. I consider him a very close friend because he has been a good friend to people on both sides of the aisle. I think I have probably gotten to know him best through our mutual membership in the House Wednesday Group. where he has been a very active. vigorous and. contributing Member throughout his career here. in fact. he has served as chairman of the Wednesday Group for a period of time when the group was at its most active. When I assumed the chairmanship of the House Wednesday Group I went to JoEt. for advice and suggestions on how one should try to leadk this organzation. and JOELs advice was excellent. I thought. He said. ""You. are dealing with about 32 egomaniacs. You do not lead them. You Just arrange the parties and stand back or you will be stampeded and trampled to death."" I found that to be excellent advice. and I found that every. bit of advice he has given.me over the years has been very valid. He is still involved and will be involved in the affairs of this country. He is presently working as head of a task force whicitr the Wednesday October 5.-1984 Group has organized to look at issues for 1985. look at priorities that we are going to be dealing with in the next year and the years ahead. As chairman of that effort. he has been working tirelessly with Members of the House as well as with outside specialists and experts to come up with an agenda of public policy issues for the 1980s and beyond. I always think of JOEL primarily as a builder of bridges. He is truly a man of the House in the best sense of that word. in that he has consistently abhorred deadlocks. and has tried to build bridges to find understanding. to clear up confusion and misunderstanding. and to bring people together. He has worked across the aisle in that respect to try and find people of like minds to build consensus and to move this House forward. if only by inches. He recognized the fact that there needs to be a spirit of good will if we are going to get anything acconiplished here. and to the extent that we have the kinds of impasses and polarizations. I think that JOEL has worked to break them down. to build the kind of bridges we need to pass effective legislation. JOEL is a man of courage. he is a man of strength. and really of uncommon skill as a legislator. but as to many have indicated here. his primary attributes are as a friend to us all. I will miss his always wise counsel. and it has never failed me. his great sense of humor which has come through sometimes when the night seemed darkest. The leavening of his wit has been a relief for us all. and his incurable optimism about this place and the fact that it can really be made to work. I will miss him. and I want to wish JOEL and Damaris the very best. I know they are going to have a very active. productive and fulfilling life. and I am sure they will be contributing to our endeavors in the years ahead. I thank the gentleman again for this opportunity."

980004765,Mr. President. that most of Americas new jobs are created by small businesses is a wellknown and oftcited fact. Less wellknown. however. is the Small Business Administrations role in this process. Over the past several years the SBA has achieved a preeminent role among those Federal agencies involved in promoting local economic development. Section 503 of the Small Business Investment Company Act was designed to make the SBA an active partner with State and local governments and the private sector in making longterm capital available for small business expansion and job creation. It is a major reason for this newfound preeminence. The 503 loan program. enacted in July 1980. can play an important role in revitalizing local communities across the Nation. Under section 503. banks are encouraged to make longterm loans available to small businesses under favorable terms. Without Federal guarantee programs such as 503. banks are often relictant to make such loans to small companies. Section 503 authorizes the SBA to guarantee debentures issued by certified development companies (CDCs) to finance the acquisition of land. plant. and equipment for small business expansion. The creation of a substantial number of new jobs is a requirement before any such loan can be made. SBA guarantees up to 40 percent of the project costs. Ten percent comes from the small business itself. And the remaining 50 percent comes from a private sector. thirdparty lender. such as a bank. Maturities on these loans can be for up to 25 years. SBA began certifying CDCs in late 1980. At the end of fiscal 1982. 284 had been so certified. Ten of these are in my own State of New York. A majority of these development companies are just getting off the ground. but 133 of them had made a loan by the end of fiscal 1982 and 87 of them had made more than 1 loan. All told. 660 loans had been made. 32 of them in New York State. The 40 percent of the project costs put up by the CDCs for these 660 loans totaled $115.1 million. Given the 28.846 documented jobs created as a result of these loans. the average SBA investment per job was only $3.990. Furthermore. this average investment per job has been steadily dropping since the inception of the 503 program. The vast majority of the Jobs created are in the manufacturing and wholesale/retail industries. In New York State. $6.08 million in loans had been guaranteed by the SBA by the end of the fiscal 1982. 1.422 jobs had been created. The average SBA investment per job was $4.668. but this figure is being brought down rapidly. The 1115 jobs created in fiscal 1982 required an average SBA guarantee of only $3.223 per job. The 305 Jobs created during the last quarter of fiscal 1982 required an average investment by the SBA of only $3.045. Every quarter since the creation of the 503 program. more and more jobs are being created and the Federal commitment per job declines. Section 503 is a classic example of a Federal jobs program that works. and works well. However. all is not perfect with the 503 program. The program is new. Manyboth inside and outside of Governmentare unfamiliar with it. the regulations governing the program still need finetuning. and the turnaround time on loan applications is still too slow. Nevertheless. I have been assured that the SBA is making a concerted effort to work out these bureaucratic entanglements. and I am confident that things will soon be running much more smoothly. There is one problem with the program. however. that is in desperate need of legislative action. This is the fact that SBA. in complete and total contradiction of clearly expressed congressional intent. has refused to guarantee or participate in 503 loans for projects in which industrial development bond financing is used. This action has been taken as part of the administrations overall policy of discouraging the use of smallissue industrial development bonds (IDBs). Since coming to the Senate. I have been one of the most vocal supporters of IDBs. Although I had not yet begun my service when the conference report on Public Law 96302 was adopted. I totally agree with what it said about the 503 loan program: SDA should not disapprove the guarantee of any debenture. or any loan made with the proceeds of a debenture issue. solely because the proceeds would be used in a project whose other sources of financing include. or are collateralized by. taxexempt industrial revenue or development bonds. This seems pretty clear to me. yet the SBA had refused to participate in any such project. A 1965 OMB circular. No. A70. which states that it is not Government policy to provide a guarantee of a taxexempt issue. has been cited as the reason for this intransigence. Never mind that under the section 503 loan program. the Government guarantees only the CDC portion of the project costs and provides no guarantee to any portion financed or collateralized by an IDB. Never mind that a 1980 expression of congressional intent should clearly supercede an outdated bureaucratic memorandum. Never mind that our economy desperately needs the new Jobs that would result from more 503 projects. The SBA still refuses to participate in such loans and. as a result. over 60 percent of the loan guarantee authority provided by Congress for the 503 program has gone unused. At a September 28. 1982. hearing before the Senate Small Business Committee. which I chaired. the SBA policy was universally condemned by all of the private sector witnesses. The point was made repeatedly that we are running a good programa potentially excellent programat less than half speed because the SBA has refused. thus far. to honor clearly expressed congressional intent. Loans which should be made. are not being made. Loan authority is going unused. And. most importantly. new jobs which could be created. are not being created The legislation I am introducing today. therefore. comes in direct response to this widely perceived need for congressional action. The bill requires that the SBA process section 503 loan applications without regard to whether or not other parts of the financing package include. or are collateralized by. industrial development bonds. This bill simply raises existing conference report language to the status of legislation. No other solution has worked. Negotiations over the issue have broken down. Thus. the Congress must act. The 503 loan program must be allowed to achieve its full potential. The majority of the loan authority granted by Congress for this program must not continue to go unused. Mr. President. I urge the adoption of this legislation and I ask that the full text of the bill I am today introducing be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.
980025675,"Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation which would designate the 59.1mile section of the Long Island Expressway (LIE) between the Clearview Expressway and Riverhead in New York part of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Currently. the Long Island Expressway carries heavier volumes of traffic than most other sections of the Interstate System. The LIE has an average daily traffic volume of 150.000 vehicles at the New York City/Nassau County line and 120.000 vehicles at the Nassau County/Suffolk County line. The volumes on the LIE are about three times higher than the urban interstate nationwide average of 44.288. The LIE is a critical transportation and economic link between Long Island through New York City to the other States for some 2.6 million people in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Some 90 percent of all raw materials brought to Long Island manufacturers are brought by truck. while more than 90 percent of finished goods sent out of Long Island and distributed nationwide are transported by the same mode. Almost all of this activity occurs on the LIE. The primary justification in 1956 of building an Interstate System was the need for a highway system for national defense. Two of the largest defense contractors in the NationGrumman and Republicare located on Long .Island. Therefore. Federal Interstate funds should be allocated to maintain the LIE as it serves several important defense industries. Mr. President. early this year. the Presidenit signed into law the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA). I supported this measure and was intimately involved in drafting certain titles of this landmark piece of legislation which will help us address this Nations deteriorating infrastructure. I compliment my good friend from Vermont. Senator STAFFORD. for the excellent work which he and his staff did in formulating the Federal aid highway title of STAA. STAA provides that some $21a billion annually be allocated to the ""4R"" program for interstate resurfacing. restoration. rehabilitation. and reconstruction. Because Long Island does not have any interstate highway. however. it will not share in the ""4R"" program. It is my understanding that Nassau and Suffolk Counties. which comprise Long Island. are the only counties with populations over 1 million people. respectively. without access to an interstate highway. I believe that It is time to rectify this inequity. Mr. President. I will work closely with the chairman of the authorizing committee to make the LIE Interstate now.* By Mr. BOSCHWITZ (for himself. Mr. BOREN. Mr. BURDICK."
980076697,Mr. President. I rise today in support .of legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island. Mr. CHAFEE. The purpose of the bill is to increase the investment capital available to new businesses. As a member of the Emall Business Committee. I am conce -ned about the difficulty new firms have attracting capital. Without the opportunity to raise funds. growing enterprises have their innovative ideas stifled. The measure introduced today will help alleviate this problem. It will mandate a 10percent capital gains tax rate on income generated from initial investments in the stock of new conpanies. The same individual has to hold the investment for at least 5 years. The capital raised from the issuance of stock must be utilized for working capital purposes. This legislation will create a major incentive for individuals to make longterm investments in new companies. A lower capital gains tax rate will provide a flood of venture capital into growing young firms. In this way. jobs will be created from the capital liarnessed to finance new ideas. This legislation will broaden an existing avenue of finance available to new enterprisesventure capital. Small firms will have to rely less on commercial banks for funding. This is the best manner in which to assist small firms and protect existing jobs. It has become vogue in Washington to discuss industrial policy. I believe that this debate should focus more on new businesses with Innovative ideas. For this reason. I have introduced the Small Business Capital Formation Tax Act of 1983. S. 1043. which now has 15 cosponsors. Like the legislation introduced today. it provides tax incentives for investment in small enterprises. This is critical to the future health of our economy. To the extent that jobs are created through increased investment. the tax base is expanded. Without a consensus in Congress to reduce spending. the only way to mitigate the impact of the budget deficit is through savings and investment. If the individual savings rate can be improved. it will be easier to finance the budget deficit. This will avoid crowding out of private financing needs. In addition. if the savings rate can be improved. new taxes will be generated and the deficit reduced. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this legislation Introduced today.e By Mr. SIMPSON (for himself and Mr. WALLOP):
980090654,"Mr. President. I support Senate Joint Resolution 158. which addresses the gravest. most frightening event of the decade: The wanton massacre of 269 human beings by the Communist Government of the Soviet Union during the night of August 31September 1. 1983. This criminal action. perpetrated deliberately by Soviet Air Force fighter jets against an innocent. unarmed commercial Korean Air Lines passenger aircraft. will Join in Infamy the atrocities of our century committed by others who have demonstrated total and brutal disregard for the value of humnin life. The night of August 31. 1983. is a date the world will remember. On that date all rules of civilized human conduct were shattered. all hope that the -Soviets could abide by international law was lost. and all fears that true -evil could exist at the core of a modern r state were confirmed. The ignominy of e the deed is exceeded only. by the calbous and blatant lies of the U.S.S.R. immediately following the barbarous act and Is compounded by the feeble attempts of the Soviets to cast blame on the United States. It Is Incomprehensible to me how human beings could have performed such a cruel act against fellow human beings. It Is sickening to me to hear the futile protestations of Russian diplomats blaming the United States for their own perfidy. Mr. President. this terrible act by the Soviet Union has provided to the world a new definition of moral perversion and pseudodiplomatic duplicity. With a unique disregard for its proven culpability. the U.S.S.R. loudly proclaimed its innocenceand the guilt of most Western powersfor nearly a week. Only 5 days following the malicious downing of the Innocent airliner did they finally confess their crime. But even this grudging admission was qualified by absurd references to the responsibility of others and to unrelated activities 1.000 miles from the scene of their treacherous deed. And the reason. Mr. President? The rationale behind such a heinous act? The sole explanation for the slaughter of 269 Innocent civilians. Mr. President. is that. they were trespassing in Soviet airspace. The incontrovertable facts have been made public. Mr. President. They have been presented to a shocked Security Council of the United Nations. They have been detailed In the media of all countries outside the Soviet Union and its satellites. At the United Nations. a body which in the past has appeared to be more comfortable villifying the United States. nearly all the members of the Security Council sat in stunned silence while the American Ambassador. Jeanne J. Kirkpatrick. presented the irrefutable evidence: The recorded voices of the Russian pilots while tracking. identifying. and then destroying the civilian aircraft. ""The target is destroyed."" the Russian fighter pilot calmly reported after firing two missiles at the unarmed plane. sending 269 civilians to a horrible death. Confronted with this incontrovertable evidence. the Soviet representatives response was predictable: By sofliC convoluted rationale he blamed the United States. Mr. President. the calumny of this act by the Soviet Union is appalling and the subsequent attempts by the Russians to distort and obfuscate the facts surrounding the crime have served to sicken the wvorld. The Soviets have had the audacity to proclaim that the Korean airliner was deliberately off course and that this was the result of direction by the United States. The Soviets have also claimed that in sonme obscure manner the United States was using this passenger aircraft for intelligence purposes. Such allegations are absurd in the extreme. The Soviets knew at the time by visual inspection of the distinctive shape of the aircraft that it was a commercial passenger Boeing 747. They knew that the altitude of the aircraft was a routine commercial flight altitude. They knew that the aircraft was on a course parallel to established international routes. traveling In a straight line. action to be expected of a commercial International aircraft. They knew. despite their lies to the contrary. that the aircraft displayed both navigational and strobe lights. unique to commercial airliners. For the Russians to claim that they thought the aircraft was anything other than an innocent. unarmed. commercial passenger aircraft is absolutely ludicrous. What the Russians have found out over the past 10 days. Mr. President. is that there were 269 souls aboard the illfated flight. There were Korean. Chinese. Japanese. Canadian. British. Australian. and American civilians on the aircraft. including a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. In total. citizens of 13 countries were on board KAL flight 007. There were men. women. children. and infants on the flight. But they unwittingly trespassed. they were hunted. and they were. as the Soviet pilot reported. ""destroyed."" Two hundred sixtynine human beings. Mr. President. Their lives were snuffed out because the aircraft on which they were traveling inadvertantly crossed into a land of paranoia. a land of lies. a land of brutality. The world has learned again that the Soviets are indeed capable of descending to the unfathomable depths of abominable behavior. We have also learned much about the Soviets as a result of this dastardly action. Mr. President. We have learned that the Soviet Foreign Minister considers his countrys borders ""sacred""-obviously more sacred than human lives. We have learned that the Soviets. when confronted by the specific and damning evidence of their guilt. are capable of fanciful prevarication which. one must assume. even they do not believe. Mr. President. we have learned that the Soviets are capable of taking the most criminal. wanton act and compounding it by attempts to show that they are not responsible for the act. Throughout these past days. since the night of August 31. the U.S. Government has reacted with remarkable restraint. Rather than responding to this violence with more violence. we and our allies have effected strong. but measured actions designed to express our horror at this act and to elicit appropriate response from the Soviets. President Reagan. in his address to the Nation and the world on September 5. presented indisputable proof of the Soviet guilt and announced the intentions of the United States. Our representatives to the United Nations presented to that bodys Security Council the voices and the transcripts of the Russian pilots as they deliberately shot down the unarmed passenger jet. And our Secretary of State met with the Soviet Foreign Minister head on. for the specific purpose of demanding full Inquiry and publication of the facts of the terrible event. But the actions proposed and taken thus far have been necessarily limited in their scope. The United States Is but one of 13 directly injured nations and but one of scores of offended nations. We cannot act unilaterally. We cannot effectively curtail the transfer of high technology to the Soviets If our allies -continue in a businessasusual manner. There are. however. some actions which we can take: I have already Initiated a drive to raise funds for the families of the American citizens who were executed by the Soviet missile. This fundthe Soviet Massacre Victims Assistance Fundwill provide immediate financial support for those families who have sustained a sudden. terrible loss as a result of this brutal attack. As a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. popularly known as the Helsinki Commission. I have called for a special meeting of the U.S. commission members to Investigate and bring to light all pertinent facts regarding this gross violation of human rights by the Soviets. I believe that this bipartisan congressional group can do much to insure that the details of the horrible event are fully exposed. and can identify measures which we can take to prevent its recurrence. Also. as a member of the Banking Committee I have Initiated serious study of measures which would place stringent controls and limitations on Soviet and other Warsaw Pact nations credit dealings with the Wezt.. At present. those countries owe Western governments and private banks roughly $86.4 billion for loans of all sorts. Direct U.S. Government control of the debts to the United States. coupled with prohibitions on further loans and. comparable actions by our allies. could give us a potent weapon with wide flexibility in dealing with the Soviet Union. Those actions which we have taken. and those which have been taken by other countries of the world. were met first with total denials. and now with fantastic allegations of United States involvement in the Soviet crime. It Is only fortunate. Mr. President. that the world is not as stupid as the Soviets appear to think we are. The crude lies and improbable explanations offered by the Soviets have been rejected by the world as transparent fabrications. Their insulting rhetoric. in which the United States is condemned as responsible for a Soviet barbaric attack. has been almost universally dismissedeven by many countries virtually controlled by the Soviet Union. One need only observe the unnatural. nearly total silence on the part of those who are usually the apologists for the Soviet Union. both in this country and abroad. to realize how abysmally their efforts to shift the blame have failed. And their paranoiatinged :ationaliza. tion for shooting down t1 unarmed commercial aircraft has evoked horrifled reaction worldwide. Mr. President. at this point I would like to enter into the RECORD an editorial which appeared in the September 2. 1983. editions of the New York Post. Entitled ""Murder in the Skies* a Lesson in Outrage."" it succinctly summarizes the initial reaction to the civilized world on hearing of this terrible event. The resolution before us today. Mr. President. expresses our horror and concern to the world in the wake of this tragic crime. We must speakout. we must join the other world powers. in the total and absolute condemnation of this terrible massacre by the Soviet Union. To do any less would be a dereliction of our duty. and an Ignominous comment on this horrible. deliberate act of barbarism. The editorial follows: (From the New York Post. Sept. 2 19831 MURDER IN THE SlFus: A LEBBON IN OUTRAGE The barbaric. inhuman and totally inexcusable Soviet action in shooting down the Korean Air Lines jumbo Jet with a loss of 269 people puts a clear perspective on how we should see or relations with the Soviet Union. The interception was calculated and the decision to fire on the airline was nothing less than an act of international mass murder in the skies. It is no excuse that the Russians are paranold about air space near their military bases. They are paranbid about their entire territory and paranoid. too. even about the territory of countries they have seized. The Korean plane may well have strayed off course. So what? So do many aircraft. So do Soviet. planes operating out of Cuban bases along our Eastern Seaboard. They are not shot down. They are escorted awayas are Cuban airliners which violate U.S. airspace over New York on flights to Canada. This was no accident. This was a deliberate act committed after ample opportunity was available for consultation with the highest Soviet authorities. The northern Pacific route Into and out of Korea and Japan is highly traveled. Pan Am. Japan Air Lines. Northwest Orient and many other carriers besides Korean Air Lines fly it daily. Nor could there have been any possibility that the eight Soviet Jet fighters which followed the KAL plane could have mistaken it for a hostile aircraft. They were on to it for two and a half hours. Plenty of time to have established that it was not an ""enemy"" bomber. The Soviet SU15 which finally shot It clown had It within visual observation. Indeed. the Soviet pilot Identified it as a 747 passenger airliner in his radio communicaLions with his base when he asked for authority to fire. Theire are extensive Internally agreed procedures for identifying foreign aircraft which intrude air defense -zones. The Intercepting aircraft is required to fly up to a position in front of the foreign plane and rock its wings. In addition. It flashes its navigation and landiag lights at Irregular Intervalsmeaning. ""You have been intercepted. follow me."" ."
980096379,Mr. President. I support S. 1301. a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to allow a tax credit for expenses incurred In the care of elderly family members. Put simply. this legislation Is necessary for both humanitarian and fiscal reasons. Institutionalized care for the elderly is a burden on family members and a drain on Government sponsored assistance programs. It is estimated. however. that up to 40 percent of our 1.3 million nursing home residents could live at home. In all too many instances. families are forced to institutionalize their elderly relatives because of financial reasons. This bill would provide tax credits for a portion of -expenses incurred in support of services that the chronically Ill elderly and their families require. Such services will include home health aide services. adult day care. respite care. nursing care. and medical or healthrelated supplies and equipment. This assistance will not only provide much needed emotional and financial relief for the family. it will also save money for the Government. One of the highest expenses In medicare Is institutionalized care. Nationwide. such care costs close to $20.000 annually per patient. I believe the savings medicare costs will far exceed the revenue loss.from these tax credits. S. 1301 is designed to target the greatest relief to those families most in need. The credit available will be determined ona sliding scale based on annual income. Families who have incomes under $10.000 can claim a tax credit for 30 percent of allowable expenses up to a maximum credit of $1.050. Families with adjusted gross incomes In excess of $50.000 will be Ineligible for the credit. as will the elderly whose income exceeds $15.000. Only billable services can qualify for the credit. This responsible legislation will especially assist those families whose elderly relation has a disease that is not covered by medicare or medicaid. S. 1301. for example. would help the family of an Alzheimers disease sufferer. who may be physically healthy. but mentally debilitated to the point of requiring constant care. It is this disease and many like It that makes S. 1301 so Important to the fastest.growIng group in our country. the elderly.*
980142118,Mr. Presidint. I say that the conferees knew what they were doing and did the right thing and afforded the State of Florida and its people along the west coast and beautiful gulf coast the protection to which they are entitled. 18 of the 19 Floridian Congressmen were In favor of this. The two Senators were in favor of this. and the Governor is In favor of this. As to the amendment by my distinguished colleague today. the Senator from Louisiana knows what it does. It creates a 50mile buffer. It adds 40 miles additionally between the 26th and 28th parallel and strips down the rest of the coast. strips it down to 10 miles. We are talking about mj. 1percent differential in the total area between Senator JOHNSTONs amendment and that agreed upon by the conference. That is what we are talking about. I think the people of Florida have a right to say where they wish to have the buffer. and that the place they desire to have it Is down along the coast. starting from the Apalachicola down to Naples. Additionally. the 10.3 miles was not given to Florida. No one gave that to the people of the State of Florida. That came from the Spanish deeds. The same thing happens In Texas. It is the product of a Supreme Court decision. So we did not give them 10.3 miles. The fact of the matter is the original agreement on this floor envisioned that 30mile buffer strip. 20 miles added to the basic 10 miles down along that coast. I think we knew exactly what we are doing. I think it was environmentally the sound thing to do. The senior . Senator from Florida touched on It. Let us do the environmental studies and ascertain whatever they can tell us. We should not say what a wonderful thing we did when certain lands were exempted from drilling. To get the Interior Department these days to admit these were environmentally sound lands. they must have been ecologically important. so did not do anything magnificent by doing that. I would hope that we would continue to honor the conference report because It really makes the most sense.
980160038,"Mr. President. I rise today as a cosponsor of 8. 9303. a bill introduced by my distinguished colleague. the junior Senator from Pennsylvania. This measure would repeal 10 U.S.C. 9803. commonly known as the Maybank amendment. This amendment. adopted In 1954. exempts the Department of Defense from a Pederal policy which permits Government agencies to pay a small premium on contracts awarded to firms located in labor surplus areas. This policy is intended to relieve economic dislocation. In 1980. the NortheastMidwest Senate Coalition. of whioh I am a member. led a successful effort to establish a test. program under which the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) would annually target $4 billion in nonstrategic purchases to firms located in high unemployment areas. Preliminary results show that this test program is having the desired result. Of the 86.970 contracts eligible for award under the program. valued at $8.1 billion. 10.888 were awarded to firms in high unemployment areas during the period from February 1981. through December 1988. A price differential was paid on under 8 percent of these contracts. At an insignificant. marginal cost to the Department of $1.8 million. 11.488 Jobs were created In high unemployment areas. As an unintended benefit. competition for DLA contracts increased from 40 percent to 80 percent. This. by itself. should work to hold down the cost of all procurements. In addition to repealing the Maybank amendment. this bill provides that the Secretary of Defense shall establish a program tc. allow payment of a price differential of not more than 9.6 percent on contracts with an aggregate value of not less than $13 billion in each fiscal year. beginning in fiscal year 1986. This price differential will be payable to allow firms in labor surplus areas to win contracts for nonstrategic purchases. The President would be required to provide Congress with an annual report on the implementation and results of this program.

Freddie Durr. a delicatessen owner whose little deli is located 300 yards from my house. closed up his place of business at about 11:15. after working 14 hours. He got into his van to go home. and there waiting in the back was an assailant with a tire wrench. He clubbed him to death. and took the days receipts. He was someone who had been arrested approximately 10 times. received about 10 years in prison. for possession of drugs. assault. a whole long list of crimes. The story of Freddie Durr is repeated time and time again. But we say. you know. ""We have time. We have another process. Slow down."" Mr. President. right here in the Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletinprisoners in 1983more than 30 States are under Federal Court orders or consent decrees to cap the number of prisoners they can keep in their prisons and jails. It is absolute nonsense to say that we do not have a need for more prison space in this Nation. The statement that current building efforts are falling behind. that they cannot find contractors. has never been substantiated. The fact of the matter is this is OMB speaking. This is not the Justice Department that says. ""Dont do this"". it is OMB. You cannot find a better use for this money. to see to it that the criminal justice system becomes more than a sham. more than a revolving door. And that is what we have. People have lost faith in the process. They say.. ""It doesnt work. it has broken down."" And they are right. And when the Federation of New York State Judges. and its president. Justice Murphy. says: ""Send the violent prisoners who have been convicted to prison. Dont worry about prison space because that is the function. of the legislator."" they are right. That is the function of legislators on the State and. yes. my friends. on the Federal level. as well. Mr. President. I do not believe the yeas and nays have been ordered. At this time. I ask for the yeas and nays."
980207477,"Mr. President. I rise today to cosponsor a joint resolution introduced by my distinguished colleague. the Senator from Ohio. that will designate the week of October 14 through October 20. 1984. as ""Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Week."" Myasthenla gravis. first diagnosed in the 1600s is a neuromuscular disease. although it is not a disease of either the muscle or the nerve. This disease results in a eficiency in the substance which acts _ a conductor between nerve and muscle. The major symptom of this disease is chronic fatigue. The victim experiences periods of extreme weakness. It can strike anyone at any age. An estimated 100.000 to 200.000 people now are diagnosed to have myasthenia gravis with up to another 100.000 undiagnosed cases. Unfortunately. the biggest problem with myasthenia gravis is that it is little known. Doctors often misdiagnose the disease as brain damage. emotional disturbances. or diseases of the lungs. limbs. or heart. depending on whether these parts of the body are affected by myasthenia gravis. A better understanding and more research into the cause and cure of myastinia gravis is necessary to conquer this tragic disease. Myasthenla Gravis Awareness Week will provide an mipotrtant first stepi toward the goal of iner1v.vtsld public awareness.

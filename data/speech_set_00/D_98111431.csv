980001303,"Mr. President. during the last months of the 97th Congress. public works. a much Inaligned and too often obscure corner of public policy. came back into vogue. It seems to have taken the shock of record unemployment to bring to the fore the national economic dependency on public works. Highways. roads. bridges. mass transit. water supply. and sewer systems are the underpinnings of efficient commercial and industrial activity. Yet. by all accounts these facilities are falling apart faster than we are fixing them. Some of us for quite some time have been alarmed by the precipitous decline In public investment over the last decade. According to statistics gathered by the Department of Commerce. public works investment by all levels of government declined from 4.1 percent of the gross national product in 1965 to 2.3 percent in 1977a 44percent decline. But few have been aware that such a decline has been taking place. And at a time when the need for repairing. rehabilitating. or replacing our existing public works could play a vital role in creating employment for both skilled construction workers and unskilled laborers. we have not recognized means of mobilizing the Federal Government to put an emergency public works program in place. It is not necessarily for lack of funds that we find ourselves In this predicament. We in the Federal Government seem to lack the willpower and the budgetary tools to accurately measure public investment in a way that informs us of the adequacy of present levels. Getting our facts straight is the first step toward solving the problem of ""disinvestment"". the wearing out of capital through inadequate maintenance and rehabilitation. It is for this reason. Mr. President. that my colleagues and I once again introduce the Rebuilding of America Act. The bill would lead to the development of a national investment plan. setting priorities to guide Federal expenditures for public improvements over the next two decades. The national investment plan would be predicated on the facts and findings contained in a national inventory of public improvements. On September 17. 1982. I introduced the Rebuilding of America Act (S. 2926 in the 97th Congress) with six of my colleagues. During the lameduck session. I again introduced this legislation but this time. as S. 3061. it was part of a larger effort to address both national needs in public improvements and the immediate necessity to put Americans back to work. S. 3061 was Introduced on December 1. 1982. with 16 colleagues and several days later was incorporated into the Senate Democratic jobs proposal offered to the highway gas tax legislation. H.R. In spite of the passage of the highway bill which authorized the expenditure of an additional $27.5 billion on highways. roads. bridges and mass transit over the next 5 years. I am still persuaded that a concentrated effort to conduct an inventory. establish investment priorities. and develop the principles of capital budgeting would be an extremely useful enterprise. Most important. we should build the capability in the Federal agencies to handle this information. this is not the work for outside consultants. Other articles and statements. Including my introductory remarks on September 17. 1982. enumerate the approximate bounds of the socalled infrastructure problem. I shall not repeat those facts here. However. it is worth repeating that there can be no doubt that this problem is public in nature. national in scope and appropri. ately attended to by the Federal Government. The Federal Governement is now responsible for fully onehalf of all public works investment in the United States through grants and direct investment. A 1980 Commerce Department study ""Public Works Investment in the United States."" made several interesting observations with regard to the regional allocation of Federal funds for public works: The Western and Southern regions of the U.S. received over threefourths of all direct Federal public works investment in 1972 and 1977. On a per capita basis. the Mountain region received $97 per capita in 1977 and the New England region received $3 per capita. From the Federal perspective. public works projects fall into three basic categories: first. federally owned. second. federally assisted but owned by a State or local government. and third. totally nonFederal projects. Most public works projects in the Northeastern region of the United States fall into the third category. Cities and States in the Northeast traditionally have built their canals. highways. and water systems without assistance from the Federal Government. Clearly. the Federal programs through which about $25 billion is spent each year are not meeting the needs of a significant portion of our population. Those areas are instead struggling to meet their own needs. and in most cases. they are failing to do so. It is not the purpose of this legislation to preempt State and local prerogatives in the matter of roads and water systems. but rather to help focus and coordinate Federal assistance. Since the first introduction of this legislation. a number of individuals have questioned the need for a commission to conduct the required work. Having just served on the Presidents Commission on Social Security. I am well aware of the advantages and. disadvantages of such an extrainstitutional arrangement. But in the end. the Commission succeeded where other established institutions failed in producing an agreed upon sot of facts on which to base sound public policy for both a short term and long term financing problem. Such is my expectation for the National Commission on the Rebuilding of America. I nonetheless remain open to other approaches. and indeed anticipate the introduction of additional legislation in the near future. We have an opportunity to reshape the Federal involvement in public works for the next several decades. It is time we leave 19th century solutions behind us. I shall once again request that hearings on this legislation be scheduled at the earliest opportunity in the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I ask that a summary of the bill followed by the bill itself be printed in the RECORD."
980002381,"Mr. President. I rise today with Senator PACKWOOD to propose legislation to eliminate the sunset provision of the law introduced last year by myself and Senator PACKWOOD. that permits all taxpayers to deduct their charitable contributions whether or not they itemize their other deductions. Under the legislation we introduced last year. taxpayers who do not itemize their other deductions can deduct their charitable contributions. This was responsible legislation. approved by an overwhelming majority of the Congress. Under this law. taxpayers can deduct 25 percent of their charitable contributions of up to $100. in the 1982 and 1983 tax years. from that point the amount and percentage rises at a gradual rate. In 1984. noniteinizing taxpayers can deduct 25 percent of their contributions of up to 300. in the 1985 tax year. the percentage rises to 50 percent and the upper limit is eliminated. Finally. in the 1986 tax year. nonitemizers can deduct all of their charitable contributions. without limitjust as can those taxpayers who do itemize. This is fine and good. It is equitable. and it responds to a need recognized by both parties: the need to support our charities in the most effective way possible. But Congress attached a sunset provision to this legislation last year. Having risen to 100 percent of all contributions in the 1986 tax year. the provision is entirely eliminated in the 1987 Jax year. Our current legislation would delete this sunset provision. The legislation introduced today by Senator PACKWOOD and myself would establish. as a permanent part of the Nations tax law. the right of taxpayers who do not itemize to deduct their charitable contributions. All the considerations favoring the original legislation argue against the sunset provision. and consequently for the bill we offer today. And these considerations were recognized by members of both political parties. The 1980 Republican platform stated that. ""we support permitting taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions from their Federal income tax whether they itemize or not."" This was reiterated in a telegram that Ronald Reagan sent the National Conference of Catholic Charities on September 18. 1980. in which he stated: We support permitting taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions from their Federal income tax whether they itemize or not. Mr. President. this provision was not political. It reflected the widening appreciation by the American people of the unique and vital role played by private. nonprofit organizations and the importance of devising public policies that succor and sustain them and the charitable impulse that undergirds them. It also reflected a mounting wariness toward Government monopoly and toward the enrichment of the public sector as the private is diminished. This appreciation. and this wariness. will not suddenly disappear in 1987. the time when under the current sunset provision the legislation Senator PACKWOOD and I introduced last year. with the support of the Republican platform and Mr. Reagan. would lapse. This is not a small. technical tax matter. It is an issue that speaks to major currents in American history. the basic relations and balance between the public and private sectors of our society. Return for a moment to a period of extraordinary intellectual ferment. just before the great crises of our century: The World Wars. the Depression. the rise of totalitarianism. Social and political thought was deadlocked in a conflict between two powerful schools. On one hand stood the classical liberals. who asserted the sovereignty of the individual. and looked with skepticism upon most forms of collective human enterprise. On the other hand. emerging from continental traditions both of socialism and conservative absolutism. stood the statists. They feared that such individualism would lead to the disintegration of societyreducing humanity. in Durkheims powerful phrase. to ""a dust of individuals."" In response to this dichotomy. a third tendency began to develop. a tendency that owed much of its strength to the AngloAmerican experience. It was called pluralism. While it is not properly regarded as a school of political thought. its exponents stood more to the democratic left than to the right. Among them were English figures such as R. H. Tawney. C. D. H. Cole. and the young Harold Laski. The pluralists challenged both the absolute sovereignty of the individual and the sovereignty of the corporate state. They argued that between the individual and the state were to be found a great array of social and economic entities. They believed that in the strength of these voluntary. private associationschurch. family. club. trade union. commercial associationlay much of the strength of democratic society. Such ideas had considerable resonance here. For as deTocqueville observed a century and a half ago: In no country in the world has the principle of association been more successfully used. or more unsparingly applied to a multitude of different objects. than in America. One ought not be smug about this. for voluntarism as it developed on this continent traces its roots to the other side of the Atlantic. In Britain especially private charity had assumed vast proportions by the mid19th century. As Prof. Calvin Woodard of the University of Virginia notes. In 1871 appropriations for the entire Royal Navy totaled 9 million pounds. while the collections and disbursements of the London charities came to 8 million pounds. On these shores. the pluralist temper influenced the thoughts of Theodore Roosevelt and the progressive movement. And it can be heard distinctly in this passage from a speech that Woodrow Wilson delivered a few weeks before his election in If I did not believe that monopoly could be restrained and destroyed. I would not believe that liberty could be recovered in the United States. and I know that the processes of liberty are the processes of life. Wilson was indulging in a bit of uncharacteristic hyperbole. for liberty did not need to be ""recovered"" in the United States. It had never vanished. It is important to recall. however. that the monopoly of which he spoke was private sector monopoly. business monopoly. As I said at Skidmore College in May 1978: The public life of Wilsons time was much absorbed with fear and detestation of private monopoly. and great chunks of political and social energy were consumed in devising strategies for controlling it. While this was not an easy undertaking at the time. the means were at least conceptually at hand. For the public sector itselfalong with Dublic regulationoffered a clear alternative to the private sector and one obviously responsive to public policy. Whereas it is Impossible to enact a statute to create a private institution. it is a relatively simple matter to establish public ones and to restrain the activities of private counterparts. In the process. the public sector became powerfully associated with social progress and with liberalism generally perceived. Then came the cataclysms of our centurywars and economic crises which appeared to require a centralization of public authority and an expansion of public services far beyond anything previously envisioned. In that context. the pluralists ideas seemed cautious. deliberate. almost effete. Those seeking to meet social needs that individualism could not provide for turned more and more to the public sector. to the state. and away from the realm of private. voluntary associations. To be certain. the results were salutary for the society. The result is an Irreplaceable set of common provisions for the needy. the aged. and the sick. But we are reaching a point at which it begins to be necessary to consider policies which will maintain a sound balance between our private and public spheres. As I further remarked at Skidmore. recalling Wilsons injunction against monopoly: With its continuing expansion. the public sector commences to displace the private. and to display some of the qualities of an enterprise that desires monopoly control. Today. we begin to glimpse some questionable side effects of our mounting reliance upon Government. We see it. I believe. in such diverse phenomena as the unsteady condition of the family and the erosion of private education. We also see it in the faltering pace of our economic productivity and the cool impersonality that touches so many Government agencies. And if some in political life still do not see it. or will not see it. it appears that the public sees it. and is beginning to act upon that perception. Is this a movement of selfishness. miserliness. or public lapse into what has been described as ""degraded hedonism""? I think not. More likely. we are witnessing a generalized discontcnt with the vastness. waste. and unaccountability that now characterize much of the Government. Here then. is the larger argument for the incentives to private giving that our proposal would make permanent. But let it not be thought that our proposal embodies a simplistic reaction against Government or the political process. On the contrary. I believe that our politics and Government would be strengthened by renewed vigor in the voluntary sector. The relative decline of that sector has been accompanied. not by a rise in the prestige and competency of Government. but by the reverse. I am prepared to believe that the two can prosper alongside one another. Indeed. neither can serve us well without the other. DeTocqueville understood this. as he did so many things: A government can no more be competent to keep alive and to renew the circulation of opinions and feelings amongst a great people than to manage all the speculations of productive industry. No sooner does a government attempt to go beyond its political sphere and to enter upon this new track. than it exercises. even unintentionally. an insupportable tyranny. for a government can only dictate strict rules. the opinions which it favors are rigidly enforced. and it is never easy to discriminate between its advice and its commands . . . governments therefore should not be the only active powers: associations ought in democratic nations. to stand in lieu of those private individuals whom the equality of conditions has swept away. We seek in this legislation to reestablish in a permanent way the fundamental principle that underlay the charitable deduction when it was written into the Internal Revenue Code in 1917. This is the principle that money given by an individual to charitable purposes is money that should not be taxed. The principle is clear enough. What has been less well understood is its gradual erosion as the zero bracket amount has been increased and as taxpayers have found it advantageous not to itemize. The effects have been felt by individuals. whose economic incentive to give to charity has been eroding. And the effects have been felt by charitable organizations whose donated income has been eroding. Charitable giving. as a percentage of personal income. declined from 1.99 percent in 1970 to 1.90 percent in 1979. As each onehundredth of 1 percent of personal income is equal to approximately $200 million. this decline means that total charitable giving in 1979 was some $1.8 billion less than it would have been if the levels of giving of just 9 years earlier had been maintained. Last year. our legislation restored the charitable deductions original character. and again made that deduction available to all taxpayers. This year. our legislation will make this restoration permanent. This could result in a tax reduction for millions of low- and middleincome families. and in increased charitable giving that would significantly exceed the attendant revenue loss to the Federal Treasury. Martin Feldstein. one of this Nations most distinguished economists and now the Presidents Chief Economic Adviser. has estimated that if this deduction had been available in 1975. charitable contributions would have been $3.8 billion greater than they in fact were. at a cost to the Federal Treasury of about $3.2 billion. The fundamental rationale for our legislation is familiar to every American as a basic principle of federalism: That the National Government should assume only those responsibilities that cannot satisfactorily be carried out by the States. by the localities. and by the myriad private structures and organizations. both formal and informal. that compromise this society. Structures that include the family itself. the neighborhood. the church. and the many private nonprofit agencies to be found in every community in this land. This issue is familiar to Americans as an aspect of federalism. Consider the interpretation offered by Jacques Maritain. this centurys foremost Thomist. in ""Man and the State."" published in 1951. Maritain refers to a ""process of perversion"" which occurswhen the State mistakes itself for a whole. for the whole. of the political society. and consequently takes upon itself the exercise of the functions and the performance of the tasks which normally pertain to the body politic and its various organs. Then we have what has been labelled the paternalist State: the State not only supervising from the political point of view of the common good (which is normal). but directly organizing. controlling. or managing. to the extent which it judges the interests of public welfare to demand. all formseconomic. commercial. industrial. cultural. or dealing with scientific research as well as with relief and securityof the body politics life. The ""Paternalist State"" has obvious manifestations. as when Government commences to engage in activities previously handled by nongovernmental organizations and begins to provide services formerly provided by the private sector. Many of these activities and services are not only proper but essential to the satisfactory functioning of a just social order. One cannot. for example. readily imagine cash assistance to the poor. the unemployed. the elderly. and the disabled being provided as a matter of right other than by the state. There is a more subtle manifestation of the absorption of the private sector by the public that is all the more worrisome because it is less noted. I refer to the gradual submersion of private organizations that occurs as they become dependent on the state. Consider the consequences. Independence is eroded. Autonomy is undermined. Sovereignty diminished. The actions of the state become more important. The decisions of the state become more determinative. The ability to pursue objectives that the state does not sharein ways cannot share. perhaps should not shareis curbed. The purpose of the ""above the line deduction"" is to redress the balance a little. It may not reverse the powerful historic trends but it will slow them. It will restore a little more independence to the voluntary sector. It will add a bit to the ability of the ordinary working man or woman to determine how. and on what. some of his or her money is spent. It will in some small measure retard the process that has been described as the slow but steady conquest of the private sector by the public. It will enhance the ability of voluntary organizations to fill some of the void created by the constraints on Government activity that contemporary economic conditions dictate. and that contemporary political trends increasingly I demand. t It will enhance the abilities of reli- t gious charities. of the ASPCA. of the c Audubon Society. of universities. mu- c seums. and thousands of private non- e profit institutions and organizations to s enhance the lives of millions of individuals. I believe this is worth doing. Having said all thishaving made c the case last year and won the support of CongressCongress having passed the essential provision last year permitting nonitemizing taxpayers to deduct their charitable contributions. can we continue to permit a 1987 sunset provision to hang over this legislation? Now is the time to assure our charities that the Congress will not of a sudden withdraw the lifeline extended last year. Let us proceed expeditiously on this matter. in recognition of the basic principles of our history and political culture.* By Mr. COHEN (for himself. Mr."
980012848,"Mr. President. I rise today to Introduce a bill to address one of the most unfair and unwise provisions of Federal tax law. I refer to the tax treatment under section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of charitable contributions of artists. Under current law. an art collector who donates a painting to a museum can deduct the paintings market value. But when an artist donates a painting. he can deduct only the cost of the materialsthe paint and the canvas. The same rule applies to a composer who donates a score. and to the writer who donates a manuscript. poem or other composition. In these cases. the artist can deduct only the value of his pen. ink. and paper. This has been the law since 1969. It is.unfair. because the artist has given the museum greater value than he is given credit for. It is unwise. be. cause it leaves artists precious little incentive to donate their works to public collections. Daniel Boorstin. the Librarian of Congress. testified before the Finance Committee on Octbber 22. 1979 that before this provision took effect. the Library received some 200.000 original manuscripts from writers each year. Since 1969. the Library has received only one major gift of selfcreated materials from a living author. Boorstin said: The consequence of the reduced level of acquisitions will have a disastrous effect on scholarship. on the study and appreciation of American civilization. Authors are now selling their works on the open market. dispersing them among numerous public collectors. Dr. Boorstin continued: Thus. the material ceases to be available for research in public Institutions. Even more alarming. these materials are usually stored where they suffer rapid deterioration and are subject to risks of fire. flood and theft. They are lost forever. One response would be to permit artists to deduct the market value of their gifts. This is a simple answer. but it is far from the best remedy. Such was the law before 1969. when Congress amended it for good reason: It was being abused. Donald Lubick. Assistant Secretary In the Carter administration discussed the problem in Senate testimony 4 years ago. Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1069. a taxpayer. including an artist. who contributed appreciated property to charity was entitied to a charitable deduction based on fair market value even though the appreciation was never subject to tax. In many cases. this enabled an Individual to obtain a benefit through a charitable contribution that would exceed the aftertax proceeds from a sale. According to Mr. Lubick. artists in high tax brackets were betteroff giving away their works than selling them. For example. assume an individual in a marginal tax bracket of 70 percent owns property worth $100 that has a negligible cost. If the property were sold. the Individual would owe $70 in tax and would retain $30. If the property were given to charity. the charitable deduction would reduce the donors taxes by $70. The artist earned $70 if he gave away the painting. as against only $30 if he sold it. Of course. this would not pose quite the problem it once did. The 1981 tax bill lowered the marginal tax rate to 50 percent. reducing the discrepancy. But there were many other problems. and a catalog of them can be found in Bittker and Stone. ""Federal Income. Estate and Gift Taxation at pages 197 and 198. The point is that we should not just restore the pre1969 law. Then what is the answer? Let me phrase the question a little different. ly: What is the correct principle? I propose that we permit the artist to claim a tax deduction for only what his donation costs him. When an artist in the 40percent tax bracket donates a painting to a museum. he forfeits the opportunity to earn 60 percent of the market value. That is all he would be able to retain after taxes. were he instead to sell the painting. His deduction. therefore. should be 60 percent. The cost to each artist is a function of his tax bracket. It is one minus the marginal tax rate. My bill has the tables. to which an artist would simply look to determine his ""applicable rate."" Mr. President. this bill applies to contributions of ""literary. musical or artistic compositions"" to section 501(c)(3) organizations or to Government agencies. The artist must obtain a written statement from the donee declaring that the artwork has artistic significance and will be used by the donee in connection with its exempt function. For example. a university could use a donated sculpture for teaching purposes. but not to decorate the chancellors office. This legislation would not change the rules for politicians who donate their official papets. Politicians do not get tax deductions now. nor would they in the future. The bill I am introducing today is a big improvement over existing law. It is worthy of enactment. and I urge my colleagues to support its speedy enactment. I ask unanimous consent. Mr. President. that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD."
980042594,Mr. President. I rise today to support the confirmation of William D. Ruckelshaus to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Mr. Ruckelshaus is a man of great integrity who comes to this job with an outstanding record of public service. When the President first announced the selection of Mr. Ruckelshaus to be the EPA Administrator. I commented that such an appointment would represent a return to the original purposes of the Agency. As the first Administrator of the EPA. Mr. Ruckelshaus surely knows well the history of environmental protection in this country. As such I look forward to a return under his leadership to bipartisan support for protection of our Nations environment. In his 2 days of testimony before the Committee on Environment and Public Works. of which I am a member. Mr. Ruckelshaus was open and forthcoming. He is most knowledgeable of the issues at hand. in particular the need to move ahead with the implementation of the Superfund program to clean up dangerous hazardous waste sites located throughout the country. His understanding of the seriousness of the acid rain issue also brings with it a measure of hope. But the tasks ahead will not be easy. Mr. Ruckleshaus will be taking over an Agency that has suffered major cuts in its resources and manpower over the last 2 yearsonequarter of its budget having been taken away since 1981. The EPA. as he describes it. is a crippled organization. Mr. Ruckelshaus. however. has reassured us that he will seek out the best people to manage the Agency. Now only two out of nine top positions at the EPA are filled on a permanent basis. Mr. Ruckelshaus has also made it quite clear that he will make it a high priority to review the existing EPA budget to assess where additional people and resources are needed. These are commitments that I welcome and ones that I feel are made in a sincere manner. Most important. Mr. Ruckelshaus is a person who I believe will enforce the laws that he is charged with administering. He could not have said this more precisely when on May 4. he addressed the Committee on Environment and Public Works: The environmental laws of this country were passed by Congress and were meant to be taken seriously by the administering authorities. I do take the congressional charge seriously and if Im confirmed EPA will take that charge seriously. Mr. Ruckelshaus has told us that he is excited by the challenge of running the EPA. I can think of no better qualified person for the job. The EPA is truly an Agency that needs the energies of Bill Ruckelshaus. I support his confirmation and wish him well.*
980078032,"I say to the Senator that is far the greater probability. Because the Soviets. up until now. have known that our doctrine. our deployment. our deepest conviction is never to strike first. So. whatever their computers would say. they know enough about their computers. and own methods. that they are probably inclined to discount the first report that an attack has been launched. They would say. ""Well. that is not what the Americans do. That is not their tactics. That is not their strategy."" Now. however. they would say. ""Oh. no. these are new Americans. These are Americans who. unaccountably to us. tinder a new administration that talked about war fighting. that talked about third strikes. put these most powerful weapons in exactly the place where they could only use them to launch a firststrike."" May I make this further point: The great Irony is that. at just the moment the Soviets seem to be beginning to see the wisdom of what Sakharov saidthat the most undestabilizing thing on Earth is that big silobased missilewe would go to this same deployment. The Soviets have begun testing of a small. mobile missile. We call it the PL5. for Plesetsk. We sense It is what the Midgetman is. The greatest irony and the one that could make you weep Is that there Is emerging in the world the notion that perhaps first of all we will count warheads in arms negotiations. That Is what we are going to countwarheads. That Is what explodes. Silos can hurt you if you fall into one. but if you do. It is your own fault. But it is warheads that explode. We are just beginning to get an ideait is coming out of the time that 8.000 warheads on either side is enough. it is about what either side hasthat if we could count the intermediate range Pershings and SS20s. go up another 1.500. and you are at 9.500. That is enough. Well. is it the end of arms? No. Is it the end of the arms race? Yes. just possibly. At just that moment when they see mobility as a force of stability. when they see their silos in the same way we have always seen them. the way Dr. Sakharov describes themjust when they are beginning to talk about levelJuly 2S. 1983 ing off we seem to have changed the way we view stategic policies. I mean 8.000 is enough. We have not got more. There are not that many targets. You know. this is one of the limiting factors of the use of warheads: How many real targets do you have?"
980148632,"Mr. President. as a cosponsor of S. 1762. I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of This important legislation is the culmination of nearly 20 years of hard work at mouernizing the Federal criminal code. It includes muchneeded reforms in Federal bail and sentencing procedures. the use of the insanity defense. the creation of a new Office of Justice Assistance to provide financial assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies. and increased penalties for drug trafficking. labor racketeering. and the use of a firearm in a Federal crime of violence. to name a few. I am most pleased that 8. 1762 includes many of the same provisions embodied in the Violent Crime and Drug Enforcement Act of 1982 . which I cosponsored in the last Congress and. I might add. passed the Senate by a vote of 95 to 1 on September 30. 1982. Another measure similar to that legislation was approved later in thJe session by both the House and Senate. only to be pocketvetoed by President Reagan following the adjournment of the 97th Congress. S. 1762. like its .predecessor S. 1 in the previous Congress. provides a more comprehensive approach to the problems of combating the scourge of illicit drug activities and violent crime in this country. My personal involvement with the task of fighting drug trafficking goes back to 1969. when. as Assistant to the President for Urban Affairs. I negotiated with the Governments of Turkey and France to reduce the flow of heroin into the United States. Ths effort succeeded. but the flow then shifted from Europe to Mexico and. currently. Pakistan. Our vigilance against drugs must continue. as an element of our foreign policy and of our domestic initiatives. S. 1762 will facilitate this effort. Bail reform will reduce the opportunities for pretrial flight by suspected drug offenders. while improved sentencing guidelines will standardize and. in many cases. toughen the penalties received by these criminals. I also applaud the reform of forfeiture laws. changes which can strike at the heart of racketeering and the illicit drug industry. For years. law enforcement agents have recognized that the threat of prison terms and fines do not deter crime lords. well insulated from the streets. from engaging in activities that net them millions of dollars in illegal profits. S. 1762 would permit the courts. in many cases. to mandate forfeiture of any and all illegally obtained assets. Establish the prospect of losing everything. and much of the profit motive which drives drug lords and organized crime bosses will be eliminated. This legislation also contains provislo isaddressing the problems of child pornography. crimes against the family members of Pederal officials. counterfeiting. the receipt of stolen property. and dozens of other serious crimes. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act also takes an important. though not complete. step toward addressing the problem of copkiller bullets. It would become a crime. one punishable by a mandatory. minimum 5year prison sentence. to use or carry handguns loaded with armorpiercing ammunition during the commission of a crime of violence. These are bullets with but one special characteristic: The ability to penetrate 18 layers of kevlar. the material used in ""bulletproof"" police vests. I welcome this tough statute. but I would caution this body that this provision goes into effect only after a policeman already has been shot. or at the very least placed in serious jeopardy. I am gratified that my distinguished colleague from Nevada. Senator LAXALT. has agreed to hold prompt hearings on my bill. 8. 555. which ban the sale. manufacture. importation. and use of these bullets. This proposed ban ias the public support of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. the Fraternal Order of Police. the International Union of Police Associations. as well as dozens of other national and State law enforcement organizations. Only in this way can we give our law enforcement officers the protection they need and deserve. I am quite pleased. nevertheless. at the shape this bill has taken. and I would urge all of my colleagues to lend their fullest support of it."
980154797,Mr. President. I rise today on a matter of large import for the fairness and efficiency of the tax system. This is the proliferation of tax shelters. the near epidemic of investments designed to enable taxpayers to reduce their taxable incomes by more than the amounts they invest. Shelters take the form of investmentsand who among us does not want to encourage investment? But these are not economic investments in a true sense. Here. investment occurs. not with the expectation of economic profit. but rather with the assurance of tax deductions. credits. and losses. The goal is not to produce a profit. but to reduce the tax liability on ones income from other sources. According to Joseph A. Pechman. Senior Fellow at the Brookings.Institution. in Federal Tax Policy (1983): Tax shelters permit individuals to reduce drastically or even to wipe out tax liabilities on large incomes by taking advantage of preferential provisions in the tax law. I have no argument here with tax incentives designed to promote economically and socially desirable activities. I must and will oppose tax avoidance schemes designed solely for tax advantages. I am concerned about tax loopholes which merely allow the most wealthy among us to avoid bearing their fair share of the tax burden. thereby increasing the burden on the middle and lower income Americans. I rise then. Mr. President to introduce legislation. the Tax Shelter Reform Act of 1984. to address this problem. This is not a minor. nor idle. matter. Taxsheltering schemes are increasing greatly. both in number and volume. According to a report in U.S. News & World Report of June 13. 1983. Robert A. Stranger & Co.. an investment adviser firm. has estimated that total investments in taxshelter partnerships. the primary vehicles for these transactions. increased more than 100 percent from 1980 to 1983. from $5.7 billion to $12 billion. and will reach $14 billion this year. The Stranger firm also estimated that 750.000 individuals invested in tax shelters in 1982. and the numbers are rising. These shelters generally are investments designed to take advantage of a loophole. In which the investors return mainly is based. not on economic profit. but on tax savings with respect to income from other sources. The total cost to the Treasury. to ordinary taxpayers. are large. but hard to estimate with precision. Last year. the Internal Revenue Service examtied 95.000 taxshelter returns. involving more than $1.7 billion in disputed tax deductions and credits. At this rate. the current IRS backlog of 350.000 questionable returns with tax shelters represents more than $6.5 billion in foregone or potential revenues. As these represent only the most questionable tax sheltersabout 10 percent of all sheltering activities. according to estimates by Stranger & Co.total costs to the Treasury could reach $65 billion. Mr. President. permit me to explain how these schemes provide a wealthy taxpayer with overly generous tax benefits. Most arrangements are quite a bit more complex. but a basic understanding of tax shelters is necessary in order to combat them. A classic tax shelter could involve. for example. a machine leased to a farmer. The investor contributes. say. $10.000 in cash. and the tax shelter promoter arranges a $105.000 loan. Of the $115.000. the promoter takes $15.000 and $100.000 is used to buy the machine. The machine investment qualifies for the investment tax credit (ITC) of 10 percent of the entire $100.000 cost. so the Investor can subtract $10.000 from his tax liability for that. credit. At this point. our investor has invested $10.000 and received a $10.000 tax credit from the U.S. Treasury. But the investor is also entitled to additional tax breaks. in the form of depreciation deductions. because the machine can be written off or depreciated over 5 years. The accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) provides for a 15percent tax deduction. based on the machines total cost. in the first year. In addition to the $10.000 tax rredit. therefore. the investor would claim a deduction of almost $15.000 in the first year. For an investor in the 50percent tax bracket. this deduction is worth nearly $7.500 in tax avoidance. Finally. the taxpayer can deduct any payments for interest on the $100.000 loan. This last deduction usually offsets the tax liability on any income derived by the investor from leasing the machine to the farmers. Thus. the investor who puts up $10.000 has gained immediately tax benefits of $17.500. Our investor. moreover. continues to collect tax savings in succeeding years without any addtional investment. In year 2. the interest deduction continues to offset the tax liability for the leasing income. while the depreciation deduction rises to 22 percent. This means the tax shelter investor can claim a new deduction of almost $22.000. equivalent to a tax credit of almost $11.000 if he. like the typical tax shelter invester. is in the 50percent bracket. This return of almost $2 In tax reductions for every dollar invested. Just in the first year. and about $28.000 in tax savings over 2 years for a $10.000 investment. is not unusual. Under more complex arrangements. the investor can generate even greater tax savings. The investors depreciation deductions continue for 3 more years. moreover. and if he ever sells the property any gain will be taxed at preferential longterm capital gains rates. For the promoter and purchaser of a tax shelter. the object of investment matters littlereal estate. equipment leasing. oil and gas exploration. industrial research and development projects. These are the foci of tax shelters. because these are the kinds of investments for which Congress has provided the greatest number and breadth of tax incentives. Tax shelter schemes have proliferated despite passage of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and its provisions curtailing shelters. According to a Washington Post report of November 6. 1983: Congress and the Internal Revenue Service have taken a series of steps to tighten up regulation of tax shelters. but to no avail. The market in taxbased limited partnerships continues to come up with new ways to skirt the edge of the law. Other analysts agree. For example. a Wall Street Journal article of February 15. 1984. reported that many legitimate partnership syndicators feel that many partnerships being sold today make little or no economic sense. apart from their tax deductions. Efforts by the IRS and the U.S. Tax Court to stem abusive taxsheltering activities have been hindered by the sheer volume of cases. At the close of 1982. 300.000 tax returns with taxshelter arrangements were In the exarnination process at the IRS. 1 year later. the Service had completed examinations of 95.000 returns with tax shelters. but the backlog had reached 350.000 returns. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation. 20.000 cases involving tax shelters. representing asserted tax deficiencies of $1.4 billion. are pending now before the Tax Court. The proliferation of taxsheltering activity not only costs the Treasury great sums and strains the capacity of the IRS and the U.S. Tax Court. it also threatens our essentially voluntary system of tax collection. The IRS audits roughly 1.5 percent of all returns filed. As 98.5 percent of all returns are not audited. we must rely on most taxpayers to report correctly their income tax liabilities. So far this has worked because Americans are honest and because Americans believe that the. Tax Code is essentially fair. The proliferation of tax shelters. designed almost exclusively to reduce the tax liability for wealthy investors. undermines these vital beliefs. A recent study by the Joint Tax Committee emphasized this point. stating: A major concern Is that the highly visible marketing of tax shelters. and the accompanying belief that the Internal Revenue Service cannot deal with them. may erode taxpayers confidence in the fairness and effectiveness of the tax system. Sociological research supports the proposition that taxpayers are more likely to comply with the tax laws when they perceive the system to be fair or when the costs of noncompliance are perceived as relatively high and relatively certain. The widespread use of tax shel. ters deprives the system of its claim to fairness and retards the administrative and Judicial processes to the point that penalties seem neither certain nor costly. In the present era of immense budget deficits. we can no longer tolerate tax expenditures with little or no economic justification. nor can we tolerate a tax system which permits the most wealthy among us to escape their fair tax liabilities. This bill would represent an important advance against. abusive taxsheltering activities. A sectionbysection analysis of my proposal and the bill follows. and I urge my colleagues to support this effort.
980242303,"Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation to clarify a provision of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. to ensure that. as Congress intended. the Teachers Federal Credit Union in Farmingville. NY. can proceed with its plans to sell and lease back its headquarters building under the law applicable prior to that act. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 changed the rules for this type of saleleaseback transaction. With the approval of the National Credit Union Administration. the Teachers Federal Credit Union has been plannti g Just such a transaction since 1982. My bill would ensure that this sale/leaseback could proceed as it was planned. rather than under the new rules inserted into the Tax Code by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The Senate version. of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 specifically exempted this particular transaotion from the new leasing restrictions of the bill. The Teachers Federal Credit Union project was mentioned by name. The House bill did not include such an exception. and when the House and Senate conferees met to reconcile their differences. there was agreement to provide broad transitional relief for transactions that already had been planned. The House did not accept language specifically naming the projects to be excepted from the new sale/leaseback rules. General language was drafted to cover a large number of planned saleleaseback projects. It does seem that the conferees did intend to exempt the Teachers Federal Credit Union. but they may have invdvertently failed to do so for technical reasons in the drafting of the act. Section 31(g)(4) of the act provides a broad exception for virtually all saleleaseback projects approved by Feder rl. State. or local governments prior to 1984. This section states that the new leasing rules do not apply if. first. on or before November 1. 1983 there was significant official governmental action with respect to the projects. and second. the taxexempt entity entered into the lease pursant to a written binding contract agreed to prior to January 1. 1985. The Teachers Federal Credit Unions planned sale/leaseback clearly met these two tests. Unfortunately. this exception does not apply to the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof. For certain purposes. Federal credit vnions have been treated as instrumentalities of the United States. Therefore. even though Teachers Federal Credit Union is a wholly independent financial institution. there is concern that it may not qualify under the broad exception of section 31(g)(4). despite the fact that the transaction had been planned since 1982. The National Credit Union Administration approved the proposed sale/leaseback in 1982. and the conference report language on section 31(g)(4) interpreted that section to ensure that ""the approval of financing arrangements by a regulatory agency"" like the National Credit Union Administration would be sufficient to satisfy the socalled significant governmental action requirement discussed above. It does appear to me that the conferees did intend to exempt the Teachers Federal Credit Unions sale/leaseback transaction. but the drafters of the relevant section were unaware that Federal credit unions sometimes have been viewed as Federal instrumentalities. The ambiguity surrounding the exception. as now drafted. has cast doubt on the completion of Teachers Federal Credit Unions saleleaseback. Accordingly. I am introducing this legislation to clarify this ambiguity in section 31(g)(4). and make it absolutely clear that. for purposes of that section. Federal credit unions are not deemed to be instrumentalities of the United States. The Teachers Federal Credit Union will be able to proceed with its planned sale/leaseback. with no unnecessary uncertainty. This is a simple technical correction. and I urge its prompt passage. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the RECORD."
980263097,I thank the Chair. Mr. President. what this represents. I fear. is yet another example of a curious insensitivity on the part of some regions of the Nation to the efforts that we have been making in this body. I for certain know that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico came to me when I first arrived in the Senate and spoke of this matter. We agreed that the Federal water program had become so heavily biased in favor of some regions of the country to the exclusion of other regions that for practical purposes no water resources legislation was passing anymore. The last major water resources bill that passed this body. Mr. President. was in 1970. 14 years ago. A small bill was passed in 1976. But the whole administration of Mr. Carter chme and went without a water resources Lill. as the first administration of Mr. Reagan may do. One of the reasons is that we have never been willing to undertake a national water policy which by definition would include the whole of the Nation as against the practices of the past which have excluded so many regions. To give some detail. Mr. President. during the period 1956 to 1980. the four major Federal water agencies spent 36 percent of their construction money in the West and 40 percent in the South. and they spent 6 percent in the Northeast. In those 25 years. Mr. President. the State of Montana received over $1.200 for every man. woman. and child. And how much was spent for each New Yorker. Mr. President? $36. It is not just a question of an imbalanced expenditure. It is expenditure on the wrong things. One can ask. Is our corner of the continent so well endowed with water that we do not need water resource development? I think not. To be sure. it rains more in New York than in Utah. but natuie is upredictable. The water does not always come at the right time or in the right place. The great tradition of internal improvements that began in the 1820s in our country was extended to water resource development. and has made the desert bloom in the most unlikely places. But the problems of the great urban centers of the Nation. the vulnerability to drought and the deteriorating water delivery systems. have been ignored. The city of New York. which is spending 10 percent of its capital budget on a new water tunnel. a project that is absolutely essential. has not received a penny of Federal funds for the rehabilitation of its water supply system. There needs to be some equity. There needs to be some acknowledgement that other persons and regions have rights and responsibilities. Menbers of the Senate are responsible for seeing that these rights are recognized. and that there be some equity. Mr. DOMENICI and I 7 years ago introduced a measure in this regard. We proposed to end the chaotic. system under which we now operate. to let each State receive a fair share of funding for the priority water problems in that State. There has been no action. Instead. we find in the last week of the Congress reports that a giant oil company and a half dozen corporate farmers in a particular valleyin this case in Fresno County. and Pleasant Valley is the particular locationare going to get themselves huge Federal subsidies for water. Do you know what they will do with that. Mr. President? Do you know what those subsidies will do? It is a rather interesting point. I ask my colleagues particularly from this side of the aisle to consider what they will do. They will get this Federal subsidy for water. It will be paid for by persons who pay taxes in this country. particularly in our region of the country. They will get this subsidy. They will considerably Increase their profits. and that will enable them to considerably increase their contributions to political action committees that denounce Federal subsidies. They will go on and on about wasteful Federal programs introduced by profligate eastern liberals of the sort that have led the country into bankruptcy deficits and doom while they grab. grab. suck. suck. grab. grab. suck. suck. and forever $100 million in profitsbecause the profits get up that large- a tithe is paid to the political organizations that denounce the very system which has created these rewards. Mr. President. we get weary of this. and ought to be. If the Federal Government cannot charge the real value of this resource. then elementary market economics says that the resource will be misused. It is not only misused. but then in turn some portion of the consequence is directed to a distortion of Federal policy. to the implication that if you are an oil company. it is not a subsidy. If you are an urban. unemployed family. then it is. Economic incentives may never be given to the lowincome persons. but may with abandon be provided to the corporate farmer and the corporation. Mr. President. may I just say that Mr. Ward Sinclair very properly points .out that this is our water tooour water. too. It is the Nations water. The Bureau of Reclamation is not something one would ever regret. Theodore Roosevelt of New York proposed it. But there comes a time when sharing is in order. There comes a time when there is something perverse about a system which provides vast uneconomic returns to some Individuals in the society from Government which they in part will divert to denouncing such activities for others who are considerably. vastly more in need. Mr. President. I will close with this simple thought. We are not going to get a national water policy as the Senator from New Mexico and I had hoped until it is established once and for all that this kind of special interest raiding of a resource will not work. If it is thought by any that this is going to get through the Congress in this last week when everyone will le busy with other matters. halfdazed with fatigue by the time we get to Thursday night. to Friday. I would like to sugges that I will try to reserve some small measure of energy to be on hand when the effort is made to insure that it does not succeed. Mr. President. I thank you for your thoughtful and courteous attention as always. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
980275822,"Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation on a matter of grave concern. the longterm welfare dependency of families headed by teenage mothers. My measure is designed to provide assistance and services to help these young mothers remain in school or find employment. The legislation would support a package of particular serviceschild care. employment training. job placement. and academic and vocational educationthat are the essential components of any effort to avert longterm welfare dependency and encourage greater selfsufficiency in teenage parents. The problems of teenage pregnancy have reached shocking proportions. In 1981. nearly half of all births to women under 20 were out of wedlocka 58percent increase since 1970. when 31.5 percent of all births to teenagers were out of wedlock. In two decades. the number of outofwedlock births to teenage mothers increased 2.5 timesfrom less than 100.000 births in 1960 to more than 250.000 in 1979. We can no longer avoid recognizing the serious health. social. and economic consequences associated with child birth at a young age. We long have been aware of the health risks affecting both teenage mothers and their children. Maternal mortality rates among teenage mothers. especially among mothers under the age of 15. are higher than those among women who b r children in their twenties: In 1977f8. the maternal death rate among mothers under age 15 was 18 per 100.000 live birthsfully 21/2 times that of mothers aged 20 to 24. Low infant birth weight. which we know to be strongly associated with infant mortality occurs most often in the babies of teen mothers. as they are less likely than others to receive early prenatal care. Teen mothers aged 15 or younger are fully twice as likely to give birth to lowweight babies. than are mothers aged 20 to 24. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 1980. only about half of teem mothers between the ages of 15 and 19 received any prenatal care in the first 3 inonths of their pregnancies. All the more distressing. just onethird of mothers who gave birth at under the age of 15 received any prenatal care during the critical first trimester of their pregnancies. There also is evidence that a mothers age at the time of her childs birth is related to the childs physical and cognitive development. A child born to a teen mother is at much greater risk of a whole range of problems. than ii a child whose mother is 20 or older. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has examined the social. emotional. and Intellectual development of children born to teenage mothers. The Institute found that children born to parents age 18 and younger scored lower on standardized tests of cognitive development. than did children born to parents ages 18 and 19. These children also were more likely to be living in singleparent homes in high school. and score lower on academic aptitude tests in their teens. As expected. serious economic consequences are associated with early child bearing. Most teen mothers fail to finish high school. and consequently face bleak job prospects and increase their prospects of finding themselves on welfare. In a 1981 New York City survey. fully 90 percent of all young mothers aged 15 to 17 were unemployed 9 months after delivering their first child. Without jobs. 66 percent found themselves on public assistance. Although five of six teenage mothers surveyed said they wanted to return to school or get a job. nearly half could not do so because child care services were not available. The income for those teen mothers who did find jobs was but half what women who give birth in their twenties and after earn. And consider this: the proportion of teen mothers on public assistance in this survey66 percentis fully twice the level of all new mothers. New York City is not alone. Dr. Wendy Baldwin. Chief of Demographic and Behavioral Sciences at the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development in testimony before the Select Committee on Children. Youth. and Families. on July 20. 1983. reports that nationally: Women who become mothers while adolescents exhibit reduced educational and occupational attainment. lower income. and increased welfare dependency relative to their peers. Dr. Baldwin made special mention of the lasting effects of early child bearing. stating: The effect of adolescent childbearing on education is especially important since it affects occupation and earnings. A decade after high school women who became mothers early were more likely to be working than their classmates but in jobs of lower pay and prestige and with less job satisfaction. Several studies have shown that the effect of an early age a first birth on occupational attainment is a function of reduced education. and. to a lessor extent. of increased family size. Dr. Baldwin makes one final point worthy of our notice today. Women who begin bearing children as teenagers are more likely to find themselves dependent on welfare for a protracted period of time. Teen parents often are prevented from achieving their educational and career goals and. as a consequence. are more reliant on public assistance. Today. more than 60 percent of all women on AFDC were teenagers when they had their first child. In 1975. $8.55 billion in Federal spending for AFDC. medicaid. for food stamps. and foster care went to teenage mothers and their children. This is an enormous sumalthough I would caution my colleagues from inferring that this total sum would have been saved had these mothers postponed their first birth. soike would require public assistance in any case. It is quite clear that adolescent parents are not only more likely to require welfare. but also are more likely to be dependent on welfare for a longterm. than are more mature parents. This is a recent finding by Mary Jo Bane and David Ellwood. of Harvard University. In ""The Dynamics of Welfare Dependency: The Routes to SelfSufficiency."" Bane and Ellwood examines the characteristics of those on welfare for long periods of time. They found There are dramatic differences in the length of AFDC spells among different groups of recipients. Women who become a female head by having a child. nonwhites. high school dropouts. mothers with many children. and those without previous earnings all have longer spells of AFDC. They also found that threefourths of all spells on AFDC began when a woman became head of the family. while only 12 percent began when a woman with children lost her job. Obviously we must continue to provide forms of public assistanceAFDC. medicaid. food stamps. and foster care servicesto poor adolescent mothers and their children. But the pervasive and longterm character of the consequences of early childbirth are deeply disturbing. Longterm welfare dependency among adolescent mothers Is dimming the future of thousands of young Americans. The legislation I am introducing today. Mr. President. would alleviate this situation and reduce the longterm welfare dependency of so many families headed by teenage mothers. It is my belief. my hope. that the services supported by this measure would enable thousands of adolescent parents to achieve real selfsufficiency. My legislation would provide Federal grants to help the States offer the services poor young mothers need to complete their educations and be prepared for employment. States applying for these funds would ckentify those areas with a high incidence of teenage pregnancy. and funds would be targeted to lowincome areas. States would be directed to better coordinate the administration of Federal funds currently directed to teenage mothersfunds from social services block grant. the Job Training and Partnership Act. the Work Incentive Program. the maternal and child care block grant. In their applications for these funds. States would have to produce a plan to focus a specified core of services to enable teen mothers to achieve selfsufficiency: day care services. so teen mothers can attend school or work. and employment training and job placement services. so teen mothers can gain the skills to support their children. This measure is not intended to replace existing Federal initiatives. but to complement them. Existing programssuch as the adolescent and family life demonstration project and title X of the Public Health Service Actare important efforts in discouraging teenage sexual activity and providing family planning services discouraging repeated pregnancies. Indeed. in those areas with greater increases in the proportions of young people enrolled in family planning clinics. adolescent birth rates have fallen. The family planning program is an important feature of our efforts to lessen the problems associated with teenage pregnancies. This session is nearly over. the 98th Congress is about to adjourn sine die. Yet. I invite my colleagues to join in this discussion. of how best. to stem the alarming trend of longterm welfare dependency among these teenage parents. Any success in reducing the period of time a family remains in AFDC will bring dual benefits: increased selfreliance for the teenage parent. and decreased costs for public assistance programs. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation appear in the RECORD."

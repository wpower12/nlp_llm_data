980006859,Mr. Speaker. the President has announced his plan for the deregulation of natural gas. In the name of marketplace forces. the President is prepared to place all natural gas consumers. homeowners and businesses alike at the mercy of any industry lacking the necessary ingredientcompetition. The net effect of this proposal is that the President fulfills a campaign promise made to the major oil companies to deregulate. These companies hold upward of 80 percent of the old gas. This is gas that was explored for. drilled and sold at a controlled price which was sufficient to profit these companies at that time. There is no economic justification to allow these prices to increase today. especially when we consider that gas prices are already too high and current supplies are abundant. By allowing old gas to increase in price. we remove the last. albeit. threadbare cushion for the consumer. All of our constituents who burn natural gas to heat their homes know that there is no price comparison. no transfer from one fuel source or company to another. no ability to respond to escalating prices in a normal fashion. There is no benefit to the consumer under the Presidents plan. Estimates of costs to consumers under this plan have been placed as high as $60 billion. While I think that figure will be amended as we get a better handle on the effects of the Presidents plan. it Is clear that we have provided no relief for our citizens. Changes are necessary in the NGPA. but not the type that would tilt the marketplace further from the consumer and business user. While there appears to be no economic justification for increasiig prices perhaps we should attempt to understand the Presidents basic reasons for sending this proposal forward. It appears that he believes the current oil price decrease is due in part to his actions upon taking office to deregulate oil prices. Whether or not the facts support that claim is debatable. but the assumption that what worked for oil will work for natural gas is plain wrong. With considerably shorter contract periods and a diverse means of transporting the fuel. one can make the case that there is greater potential for allowing a consumer to shop for price in oil. However. natural gas is a monopoly industry from the time a contract is signed between a supplier and a pipeline company. From that time forward. costs are passed on with no regard for what the market will accept until the consumer who is consuming less gas today pays 30 percent more than last year. This monopoly arrangement is not. altered at all by the Presidents proposal. rather it is aided by removing Federal controls. There can be no restraint or downward pressure on natural gas prices In an industry that allows noncompetitive practices such as takeorpay contracts. The administrations proposal is to limit takeorpay contracts to volumes of 70 percent at the discretion of the pipeline and supplier. The discretion to renegotiate currently exists and there has been little success. The administration also provides for a floating gas cap to cover price increases as a substitute to current fraud and abuse language that exists in NGPA. While we can cheer the administrations attempts at some form of consumer protection. we should be aware that all of these items cease to exist by January 1. 1986. Since no one believes that we will pass this bill tomorrow. the degree of consumer protection decreases as time marches on.
980038796,"Madam Speaker. May 814 has been designated ""U.S. Small Business Week"" for 1983. It is most appropriate for this Nation to set aside a week each year to honor those private entrepreneurs who are on the frontlines of economic battle daily in the pursuit of earning a living and providing employment to millions of Americans. Those owners of small businesses are todays true pioneers who are willing to take the risks. the long hours. and the headaches that can go along with running a small business. They also. however. reap the rewards of seeing something built of their own creation for which they can claim responsibility. There is little that can compare to the thrill of seeing ones own business expand and develop new products and services. The last year has not been an easy one for any business. With historically high interest rates. a weak national economy. and consumer timidity. times have been difficult for most businesses. The job that has been done by small business is nothing short of amazing. Compared to larger businesses. small businesses have coped with the ravages of the recession rather well. According to the Presidents report. ""The State of Small Business."" they were better able to withstand the recession than larger concerns. Although small companies have fared comparatively well with regard to employment and income. they have not done well in avoiding bankruptcies which are at a very high level. There are today almost 500 firms filing bankruptcy per week. ""The State of Small Business"" reports this is due to the continued high interest rates and the length of the recession. Given the fact that 500 dreams are being broken on a weekly basis. we. in Congress. must do what we can to improve the business climate in the United States so that small businesses can prosper and hire some of the Nations unemployed. As chairman of a Small Business Subcommittee. I am aware of the difficulties facing our business community and I am working to do what I can to provide the necessary and appropriate help. Perhaps the most important obstacle to overcome for most small businesses is access to capital. Although the prime rate has dropped to a nominal rate of 10.5 percent. that is still quite high in real terms. Further. the rates paid by numerous businesses certainly exceed the oftenquoted prime rate. In order to provide stable and affordable interest rates. we must adopt prudent fiscal policies in Congress and I intend to continue to oppose wasteful spending. In addition. however. I am supporting a new instrument for providing necessary capital to small business known as the ""Small Business Participating Debenture."" This hybrid of debt and equity could provide critical funds for Americas expanding businesses. It is also essential to maintain one method of financing small businessthe industrial revenue bond. IRBs have enabled some businesses to expand which otherwise might have stagnated. At this time of tight money. we should do what we can to preserve those programs which have been effective. such as industrial revenue bonds. In fact. a Congressional Budget Office study in 1981 showed that IRBs have been used overwhelmingly by small business. Those of us in Congress who champion small business also. have a responsibility to examine proposed legislation for its potential regulatory impact. Last year. we enacted the Regulatory Flexibility Act which requires Federal agencies to consider the impact of their proposed regulations on small business prior to promulgating new rules. Clearly. regulations have a greater effect on small business because the cost of compliance is spread over a smaller revenue base. Small business is less likely to have a fulltime law department. The cost of unnecessary regulation falls on the consumer. If this small business week serves to remind Congress of the contributions made by our small entrepreneurs. it will have served a useful purpose. For it is important for all lawmakers to constantly consider what the impact of their actions will be on the small business community. Madam Speaker. I appreciate having this opportunity to say how much small business means to me. We have a very active and hardworking group of business people in Cincinnati.who ask only that they be given a fair chance to survive in the business world. Lam very pleased that we have set aside this week to say to them that we appreciate their work and will consider their needs throughout the year.e @ Mr. SNYDER. Madam Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to rise in recognition of the vitality and the importance of small business in our Nations economy and to salute the Kentucky Small Businessman of the YearMr. John C. Mousera man who personifies the promise and the potential of small business as well as he exemplifies the dynamism and drive that makes small business such a driving force in our economy. In 1969. John C. Mouser purchased a small Key Market in Crestwood. Ky. When he bought it. the store had a weekly sales volume of $4.900. His net profit after the first year was $926.66. Despite intense competition from chain food stores. Mr. Mouser gradually and continually increased the customer base of his store by paying careful attention to personal service. In 1976. with the help of a Small Business Administration guaranteed loan. he moved to a new location. where he now has a sales volume of $63.400 weekly. In 1978. he purchased a second store in Middletown. Ky.. and boosted the sales there from $12.000 to $30.000 per week. In 1979. Mr. Mouser added a third store in Campbellsburg. Ky. Thirteen yeaui later after John Mouser entered the supermarket business. his operation had grown to three storesemploying 61 people with a sales volume of $143.000 weekly. By putting his own future and his own talents on the lineby bucking the odds and persevering through intense conpetition and rough timesJohn C. Mouser proved that free enterprise still works and that small business is still the driving force in the free enterprise system. I congratulate John C. Mouser for the honor of being recognized as the Kentucky Businessperson of the Year. He is a very fitting representative of the multitude of outstanding small businessmen and women of the State of Kentucky and of the Fourth Congressional District.."
980056222,Mr. Chairman. I strongly oppose the amendment before us to prohibit multiyear procurement for the B1B bomber. I am convinced that this modernized version of the B1 bomber is one of the most effective additions to our national defense system. Furthermore. multiyear procurement for the B1B saves money. and greatly benefits our Nations efforts to effectively modernize the bomber leg of our strategic triad. Opponents of multiyear procurement for the B1B argue that the Air Force has understated program costs for the B1B bomber program should not go into multiyear procurement until costs stabilize. However. the situation is quite different. The accusations being made by opponents of multlyear procurement for the B1B are based. almost solely. on a GAO report dated April 13. However. it may be wide to note that this GAO report was based not on GAO cost assessments. but rather on reported findings of other Air Force cost estimates. In fact. most of the cost estimates used in the report are outdated and have no relationship to the approved B1B program. The GAO report is flawed for many reasons. Primarily. it is based on cost analyses from the fall of 1981. before the B1B program was enacted. and in all cases the worst case assumptions in its estimates. Furthermore. the cost analyses on which the GAO report was based assumed that the B1B program was a new program and was completed before a firm BlB configuration was established by the Secretary of Defense. It totally ignored the B1A bomber program. In addition to grossly misrepresenting the actual B1B program costs. the GAO report claims the program does not meet the procurement criteria for multlyear contracts. However. there is evidence to refute this claim. Both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force have certified that multlyear procurement of the BlB will save the Government $1.2 billion and will materially enhance national security through the acquisition of a highly flexible multirole strategic bomber. Further more the B1B design is stable. and satisfies all operational requirements. It is considered the top priority of the Air Force in its modernization of U.S. strategic forces. There is absolutely no evidence to support allegations that the B1B program cost estimates understate the true program cqsts. All indicators to date demonstrate that the B1B is within its programed budget and may in fact be executed for less than the original estimate. Moreover. production of the bomber is actually ahead of schedule. The B1B program is off to a fast start. progressing rapidly and ahead of all current program goals. Based on the best available information. I believe that multiyear procurement of the BlB is a very positive. and fully warranted step in the process of modernizing our strategic bomber force. I urge you to support multlyear procurement of the B1B bomber as the most effective means of continuing the program that has produced Americas first strategic bomber in over a generation.e
980066171,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama. and I would like to concentrate on two principal reasons for this. One is the injection into the Waxman bill this year of coverage of fixedsitethat means theme parks. the big parksamusement parks which this Congress took out of the bill 2 years ago after complete hearings and deliberation. and we decided that this Consumer Product Safety Commission did not have jurisdiction over fixedsite amusement parks because they did not have the expertise and because fixedsite amusement parks were not products in the sense of the products which they are used to inspecting and regulating. We came to that conclusion. And before the ink was dry on that law. before this industry which has a good record. has had a chance to establish selfregulation. we are back here amending it and saying now we want to cover the fixedsite amusement parks. Second. I am for it principally because of the very unwise language in this amendment. which has already been mentioned. which does not set an authorized level. as most of the precedents cited by the gentleman from California do. This is not a question of authorizing so many people for the Coast Guard or authorizing so many people for the FTC. This says there shall be a minimum of employees whether they need them or not. That is bad law and we should not pass it under any circumstances. The only one that I can find. of all of the precedents that have been offered which did establish a floor. a minimum. was one for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. and it followed with the language saying that the Secretary could disregard that language if he so chose. So there is not any precedent for it. and we should not get into it. But I am concerned because the amusement park amendment in the Waxman bill will be counterproductive. I am afraid it will in fact be an unsafe amendment. Two years ago we decided amusement parks could regulate themselvesthey had a pretty good recordand that it would be better than turning it over to the CPSC which did not have qualified people. There is a basic question to answer: Is there any record to indicate that fixedsite parks deserve regulation? There are over 500 parks that would be affected by this amendment. over 175 million visitors and 1 billion rides. Now. those are a lot of numbers. Keep in mind 1 billion rides per year. Yet according to CPSCs own estimates. there were 11.000andsomeodd injuries on all carnival rides. fixed site and carnivals. Of those. there were only 438 estimated serious enough to require hospitalization. In subcommittee we found out some amazing things about CPSCs estimate. The gentleman from Oregon. who is rising now. offered that amendment. and the people from CPSC came in and told us about it and we talked to them about it. They take the number of actual injuries reported of 71 emergency rooms. and then they multiply it by the 5.000 to 6.000 hospitals there are in the country. That has no regard to where these theme parks are located. So the statistics are bogus. .to say the least. But even if you take the estimates of CPSC to be true and accurate. that is. 438 hospitalized injuries from 1 billion rides. there is absolutely no way of determining. by CPSCs own admission. how many are due to mechanical failure. preventable. or carelessness by the passengers. nonpreventable. If CPSC had jurisdication. by their own admission. they cannot tell the Congress that they could have prevented a single death or injury. They cannot tell us that. Therefore. let us look at the work of CPSC with regard to carnival rides. CPSC has had throughout this period of time jurisdiction- over carnival parks. Under questioning. Commissioner Zagoria. who has been pushing coverage for fixedsite amusement parks. could not tell us now many injuries were due to carnival rides. which they have jurisdiction of now. or how many were due to fixedsite amusment parks.
980066173,"Mr. Chairman. let us take the words of Mr. Zagoria himself. He could not tell us anything when he appeared at our markup. He could not give us the answers to any of these questions. But he did appear before a group back in 1979. and here is what he said. This is the Commissioner of the CPSC. He said: So you can readily understand we feel we are spread very thin. I should also add in talking about the 140 investigators * * * that all of these are generalists. None of them. to my knowledge. has been trained or is experienced in inspecting such equipment as amusement parks. None of them are trained in inspecting amusement parks. He went on to say: Our best role at the Federal level might be one of acting as a coordinator and resource for State agencies. I will go along with that. For the reasons I have outlined. we are probably well advised to refer to the individual States in the direct regulation of amusement rides. I think. in the interest of the riders. that is what the CPSC should do. They do not have any expertise. The first suggestion. he said. is ""to provide States with opportunities for exchanging information and establishing of communications."" . Here is what Commissioner Zagoria of the CPSC said: The Commission might help organize and sponsor training of State inspectors. They might. A third is that the Commission could serve as a clearinghouse for information on unsafe rides. They could not do any harm doing that. And. finallyThe Commission could provide help by way of engineering testing or similar technical assistance. They might. They admit they do not have any expertise. but they might do that. So finally. my colleagues. I would say that the CPSC has had experience with carnivals. It has not been able to tell us anything about it. We are confronted with an interesting issue here. The assumption is that if there is a problem. we need Federal regulation to solve it. I do not think that the record. and I just talked about the record. supports the fact that we need Federal regulation in this area. The burden of proof should fall to the agency. It has not sustained that burden of proof. This Industry. the amusement park industry. is a very safe one. with a good record compiled of selfregulation. and for this reason. and because of the very unfortunate language on putting a floor underneath the personnel. I would support the Shelby amendment."
980089066,Mr. Chairman. I will not take the full 5 minutes. by any means. but I do rise to congratulate the gentleman from California on working out an amendment here which has the general support. I believe. bipartisan support. of the Members of Congress. I know it has taken a great deal of effort and consultation in arriving at it. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the bipartisan amendments to H.R. 2230. the Civil Rights Commission Act of 1983. In my view this is a major step forward in our efforts to restore the independence of the Civil Rights Commission from the executive branch of Government. That historic independence has been threatened ever since President Reagan attempted to oust three members of the Commission without cause. Following the Presidents action earlier this year. I and many other Members responded by offering a legislative solution to make the Commission truly independent. Thirty House Members cosponsored my bill to provide for firing for cause only and to fix terms for Commissioners. In addition. my legislation would attempt to retain the seats of the sitting members of the Commission. This amendment serves to provide some insulation from political pressures for the Commissioners by making clear that the President cannot remove them except for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Thus. the Commissioners do not have to shy away from taking a difficult or controversial stand on an issue for fear of losing their positions and can feel free to call them as they see them. After all. that is the very purpose of this institution. to serve as the American conscience on matters dealing with civil rights. People serving on such an entity should not have to look over their shoulders to make sure that their jobs are not in jeopardy every time they speak their minds. Independence for the Commission has never been a partisan issue. Its been supported by every President since Eisenhower and has not been threatened seriously before this administration. That is why I am particularly pleased that this amendment is offered as a bipartisan effort to provide some measure of protection for incumbent Commissioners from arbitrary firing. By reducing the extension of the Commissions charter to 5 years from 15 years in the original bill. the author of the amendment guarantees that there will be a thorough review of this issue following enactment of this years authorization. We will then have the opportunity to consider other possible formulations for setting
980109972,"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I wish the gentleman from Massachusetts were still here. Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition to the amendment to H.R 3958. the water resource development appropriations for fiscal year 1984. offered by Mr. EDGAR of Pennsylvania. I believe that this supplemental water appropriations bill Is a good one and I commend Mr. WHITTEN. Mr. BEVILL. and the other members of the Appropriations Committee and the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee for their diligent work on this bill and their prompt manner in getting this important legislation to the floor. The funding of new construction starts for water projects has essentially been at a standstill for the past 4 years. This problem is compounded by the lack of authorization of new projects in the past 7 years. many of which are urgently needed. The committee has recognized the importance of infrastructure Improvements to the overall wellbeing of this Nation. and this bill represents a major effort to address the need to Initiate a variety of new water projects. both authorized and unauthorized. without bypassing the authorization process. The bill specifically states that ""Initiation of construction for these projects is subject. were appropriate. to enactment of needed authorizing legislation."". Moreover. the funding In this bill Is based on the assumptions in H.R. 3078. the omnibus water authorization bill recently passed by the Public Works Committee. I believe that the Edgar amendment Is unwise. and would unnecessarily delay the initial construction of water projects essential to the vitality of the entire Nation. I urge Members to oppose this nearsighted amendment. Water Is our Nations most precious and valuable resource. Because water Is a national asset. and benefits all States and Jurisdictions. the Federal Government historically and continues to assume much of the responsibility for financing water resource development. The existink national water resource Infrastructure In America Is the most impressive in the history of man. This vast system has one central purposeto serve the publics needs. It provides efficient and economical transport of goods. and makes possible residential and industrial development to provide homes and jobs for American people. Unfortunately much of this Infrastructure is In a serious state of decay with a rising rate of obsolescence. Water resource development in the United States is a continuing process that requires our constant vigilance. I believe It Is essentialthat new projects be constructed in order that our Nations natural resources be developed and preserved for the benefit of future generations. When water projects are completed. they make enormous contributions to America. The benefits derived from completed projects. in many instances. vastly exceed those contemplated during project development. However. for our Nation to enjoy these benefits. we must allow construction to begin. Virtually all of the projects Included In this supplemental appropriations bill both authorized and unauthorized. will continue to provide increasing benefits in years to come. I cannot stress forcefully enough the necessity of authorizing and appropriating for these important projects. so that construction can begin. One of the unauthorized projects in this bill. which the Edgar amendment attempts to delete. Is the Qallipolis lock and dam modification on the Ohio River. This project. which is of particular interest to me because of its importance to my district and the Ohio Valley region as a whole. has a benef It to cost ratio of 13 to 1. The Gallipolis project modification is an absolute necessity. affecting the welfare of not only the Ohio Valley region. but much of the mideontinent and northeast quadrant of the United States. It has been designated by the Corp of Engineers as one of the .two .most critical bottlenecks on the inland water system. Prompt action in implementing the Gallipolis project Is of critical Importance to the economic growth and prosperity of the Ohio Valley region and the Nation as a whole. In addition. this bill contains fundIng for other projects in the Ohio Valley that are essential to the Inland waterways system. Improvements to locks 7 and 8 on the Monongahela. the second lock at lock and dam 20 on the Mississippi. and the William Baker Oliver Lock in Alabama. are critical to the health of our region. All of these projects have been Included in H.R. 3678. the Water Resources Conservation. Development. and Infrastructure Improvement and Rehabilitation Act of 1983. the omnibus authorization bill introduced by Congressman ROE and passed unanimously by the full Public Works Committee. H.R. 3958. the water development appropriations for fiscal year 1984 provides funding to initiate construction of new water resource development projects and to continue planning and engineering on projects nearing readiness to begin consideration. The projects funded in this bill are an Integral part of the overall national water resource development program. This bill represents the best vehicle for early construction starts for new water projects. and does not violate the authorization process. I am confident that the construction of the 43 projects In this bill will create an overall growth in the Nations economy. It would be a tragic mistake to accept the Edgar amendment and delete funding for half of these vital projects. I wholeheartedly support the passage of the water resource development appropriations for fiscal year 1984."
980117696,Mr. Speaker. it is well known that the use of computers by business has expanded rapidly over the last decade. As the cost and size of computers has gone down. their use by small business has multiplied. Along with the increased use of information systems has come thle increased abuse of the new technology for criminal purposes. In fact. estimates of the annual loss in the private sector have now reached $1 billion. and that cost will expand as the use of computers by business continues to grow. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to computer crimes for a number of reasons. They often lack the resources. or do not recognize the need for implementing computer secuirity safeguards. Small concerns often cannot afford to hire expensive secuirity consultants. In addition. they lack thle inhouse expertise to investigate computer crimes. Management may also lack the skills to properly oversee a companys computer operations. thereby giving the computer programer or operator a virtual free hand. After a computer crime is committed. the small business person may not be able to rely on the criminal justice system fer help. Law enforcement agencies at all levels are unprepared to meet thle challenge of the computer crime problemn. Thle judicial system is equally unprepared for this challenge. Many computer crimes never even come to the attention of thle police. Crimes involving computers are often among the most difficult to detect. so many of these incidents go undiscovered. Clearly. there is a need to increase the awareness of small businesses to the threat of computer crime. and to let them know what they can do to prevent it. H.R. 3075. the Small Business Computer Crime Prevention Act. addresses those needs. The bill calls for the creation of a computer crime and security task force. whose members will be appointed from both the public and private sectors by the SBA Administrator. The task force will be charged with studying the small business computer crime problem. and presenting sound.. practical guidelines on computer security to the small businessesman. The task force will be required to report in a timely manner. within 18 months of the date of enactment of this bill. In addition. H.R. 3075 calls for SBAspons:.red regional forums on computer security. as well as a computer security resource center within SEA. H.R. 3075 enjoys bipartisan support. and was approved unanimously by the Small Business Committee. and I urge its adoption.
980208393,"Mr. Speaker. I rise for the purpose of expressing my strong support for efforts to assist the steel industry in obtaining import relief from a flood of foreign steel that is threatening to cause the ""liquidation"" of the industry. The steel industry. in order to be competitive in todays international markets. must have the capital so necessary for modernization. Yet the increasing influx of foreign steel at predatory rates is making recovery and capital investment impossible. For the first quarter of 1984. 6.5 million tons of steel were imported. amounting to 25.4 percent of domestic consumption. That is an alltime record for any 3month period. It is clear that the remedies of U.S. trade laws on dumping or countervailing cases are not adequate to the task of stemming this surge of imports. We need to take a far broader solution in order to assure our industry a level playing field. When our domestic producers win a dumping or countervailing duties case against one nation. the business often just moves to another foreign competitor. This problem is illustrated by what happened when the U.S. industry won a case against Brazilian steel plate. The Brazilians simply shifted their steel exports to other products. and other nations sold plate to U.S. consumers. Brazil has tripled its exports to the United States since the case was won. A coordinated. Worldwide approach to steel trade is essential to avoid this phenomenon of shifting. We cannot simply continue to utilize antiquated laws on a piecemeal basis to put our finger in the foreign trade dikethe leak will simply show up somewhere else. That is why I am supporting two efforts for an international solution to the unfair trade problem. The first is a petition filed by Bethlehem Steel and the United Steelworkers with the International Trade Commission for relief under section 201 of the Trade Act. of 1974. and the second is H.R. 5081. the Fair Trade in Steel Act of 1984. Both of these measures would provide the necessary comprehensive solution to the rapidly increasing imports of steel. The 201 petition and the Fair Trade in Steel Act would limit imports to 15 percent of apparent consumption for the next 5 years. This import limit would enable the industry to modernize and Improve its international competitive position. It would put our domestic industry on a more level playing field than it. is currently. This comprehensive approach will eliminate the excessive cost and frustration of filing numerous dumping or countervailing duties c.-ses against a host of countries. It is time we stood up for our basic industries. Let us get behind these efforts.o"
980219630,Madam Chairman. I am proud to join my colleagues. Mr. GoRE. Mr. WAXMAN. and Mr. SKEEN. in cosponsoring the National Organ Transplant Act. a vitally needed piece of legislation that will develop a naI lonal policy on organ transplants. It is indeed unfortunate that it takes a tragedy such as the death of a young husband. father. child or loved one to bring home to us the gans and shortcomings of our national health pollcles. However. once aware of the need for action. we are consciencebound to pursue it. I personally became involved in this matter when one of my constituents. Joseph Montgomery of Westwood in Cincinnati. found himself helpless when his health insurance would not cover the expense of a needed heart transplant. nor could he raise the required $60.000 deposit to be placed on the organ waiting list of a Pittsburgh hospital. I am sorry to report that time ran out for Joseph Montgomery. due to his financial restrictions. he could not obtain a heart transplant and he died. His tragedy is heightened by the realization that we had the technology for a successful heart transplant that might have saved his life. Congress must decide national policy that heart and liver transplants have advanced beyond the experimental stage. so that there should not be the slightest hesitation for all public and private carriers to cover payment for these lifesaving procedures. This bill is an excellent beginning. We live in an organized society. therefore we create institutions and establish policies to deal with human problems. such as the need for an organ transplant. on a level that individuals cannot possibly manage individually. The National Organ Transplant Act also establishes a National Center for Organ Transplantation within the Department of Health and Human Services. The bill authorizes a program of grants for the development and expansion of local organ procurement organizations throughout the Nation. and creates a U.S. transplantation network to match donated organs with potential recipients. These are steps we can take immediately in the development of a comprehensive policy on transplants. We have the capacity. but do we have the will? I think when we look at the tragic death of Joseph Montgomery and millions of other Americans who will be facing a similar fate. we can understand the urgency and necessity of developing a national organ transplantation policy today. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

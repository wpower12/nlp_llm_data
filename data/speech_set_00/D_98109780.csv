980033942,Mr. Chairman. the committees proposed budget for the EPA operating program. in real dollars. would put the EPA budget below where it was in 1974. It would put grants to the States. in real dollars. below where they were in 1974. It would give the Agency fewer staff than it had in 1974. It would permit the Agency to do less research than it did in 1974. What has happened in the last decade that permits us to reduce the size of EPA? Well. to start with. wp have passed extensive new legislation. requiring the EPA to do a whole host of things. Since 1974. we passed the Safe Drinking Water Act. requiring EPA to undertake the complex and difficult task of setting standards to assure Americans that their drinking water is safe. We passed the Toxic Substances Control Act. It requires EPA to assess the safety of several thousand new substances created every year and to insure that the 50.000 synthetic chemicals now in use do not present a danger to the American public. We passed the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act that requires EPA to regulate the disposal of 90 billion pounds of hazardous wastes. each year. June . 1983 We strengthened the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. requiring EPA to deal with toxic water pollution and hazardous air pollutants. Finally. in 1980. we passed the Superfund law. None of the statutes for which EPA is responsible has been weakened since 1974. None of the hazards that EPA is required to regulate under those laws has disappeared since 1974. On the contrary. Mr. Chairman. since 1974 we have become much more aware of the hazards presented by hazardous wastes. toxic chemicals. air pollution. and water pollution. Time and time again in O&I hearings we heard of honest resource deficiences. No. EPA has not done the job. We should not be giving Mr. Ruckelshaus the EPA he left a decade ago. He cannot be expected to do todays job with yesterdays agency. Mr. Chairman. in light of what has happened to the EPA in the last 2 years. this may be too little and too late. Yet. I urge the Houde to adopt it as the first step in a new beginning.
980043113,"Mr. Speaker. I offered this resolution of contempt in committee because no person in this country should be above the lawparticularly a person who was in a posttion of high public trust in this administration. Ms. Lavelle has appeared before some congressional committees. but it is not acceptable to substitute her quick attempt to paint the public record in testimony before other committees for the systematic review of Superfund administration by the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce. The testimony we sought includes her perceptions and actions as a public servant charged with enormous responsibility to protect the public health and environment. Ms. Lavelle must be accountable for the judments she made about utilizing Superfund and for her influence on public policy. When our investigation is completed. we must be able to insure that any defects in the statute are identified. that misguided policies are abandoned. and that any misadministration or maladministration of the law will not be repeated. Ms. Lavelles refusal to testify obstructs this investigation. Ms. Lavelles testimony is important for a number of reasons. For example: Was it sheer naivete or something more sinister that caused her apparent disregard of conflict of interest laws? Would a change in agency procedures or policies. or a tightening of the law prevent a recurrence in the future? Was Ms. Lavelles insertion into scientific deliberations at EPA an attempt to rewrite established scientific positions which did not suit her political agenda? If so. what steps can be taken to safequard scientific findings from such assaults? Were Ms. Lavelles now famous ""social"" contacts with chemical and mining industry representatives unrelated to cleanup schedules. did they reflect misguided priorties. or were they errant policies? Did these contacts in any way undermine or influence regulation? Why did Ms. Lavelle attempt to foist on the Department of Interior responsibility for hazardous mining wastes even though that policy would result in disenfranchising thousands of victims and undermining cleanup activities? Was Ms. Lavelles tendency to be an ""announcements junkie"" well Intended. as some of her subordinates have suggested. or was she motivated by some kind of political zealotry unrelated to the need for environmental response? In retrospect. what recommendations would Ms. Lavelle propose regarding changes In law. policy. and procedures involving Superfund? What unmitigated hazards did Ms. Lavelle leave in her wake which must be put before the public. and the new Administrator. to insure that the public and the environment are fully protected? Who. if anyone. directed or influenced Ms. Lavelle. either in or out of Government. including the White House. in the policies she followed or the decisions she made? This body does not prosecute cases. but must marshall the facts to distinguish between the effects of political manipulation. of management inadequacies. and of the sufficiency of statutes and budgets. It is no secret that something went terribly wrong at the EPA. It is no faint obligation that we have as a Congress to correct it. Ms. Lavelle has no legal or consititutional basis to refuse to appear before the committees of this body and to provide testimony on her stewardship at the EPA. Just recently. she was quoted by a newspaper to the effect that she is willing to testify anywhere or anytime about her role at EPA. I would hope that this bodys vote today and its vigorous prosecution will cause her and her attorney to wish they had. I would also hope it will send a sharp signal to those tempted to follow her course of deflance and contempt."
980046291,"Mr. Chairman. our discussion on House Concurrent Resolution 113 is taking many forms. We talk about the military case. We talk about the political case. We talk about our national resolve and fortitude. And. we talk about peace and economic realities. The MX fails in all cases. Placing a new missile in vulnerable silos does not make sense. Let us listen to Secretary Weinberger: I dont think the Minuteman silos can be hardened enough on a permanent basis to warrant putting MX missiles in fixed and known silos * * We have reached the conclusion that there isnt any groundbased system that is survivable. And. let us listen to Chairman ADDABBo: Placing some 40 MX missiles in Minuteman silos was denied by the Senate in December 1981. by a 904 vote. If 40 was unacceptable. why would 100 change anything? There is no political case for the MX. We do little to show our national resolve to anyone by being foolish and illogical. The Soviets know what we have. what we can do. We have 9.000 strategic nuclear warheads in our stockpile. We have all the bargaining chips we need. We are now modernizing every element of our strategic deterrentfrom the D5 missile to the Stealth bomber. Building the MX does not lead to peace. Rather. it is a waste of money and a waste of a national effort. According to the Pentagonthe home of cost overruns that never endputting the MX in Minuteman silos will now cost over $20 billion. Under the bestcase instance. which the Department of Defpnse has not yet reached more. MX will be on line three years before the Trident D5 and Midgetman. Again. to quote Chairman ADDABBO: What s the cost effectiveness of at least $7.4 billion per year for an attractive target in a vulnerable silo? Listen to the other experts: Maxwell Taylor. former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: ""The MX fails to qualify as essential."" McGeorge Bundy. former National Security Adviser. Robert McNamara. former Secretary of Defense. Cyrus Vance. former Secretary of State: ""The MX is an unneeded duplication of programs."" Stansfield Turner. former Chief of Naval Operations and former director of the CIA: ""If the MX is deployed in fixed silos. the probability of nuclear war by miscalculation or accident increases."" We have heard from the experts. We have heard from the bishops. We have also heard from the American people. Last November 70 percent of the American people voting on this issue voted in favor of an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union for an immediate. verifiable freeze on the testing. production. and deployment of nuclear weapons. This body confirmed that feeling with our vote on the nuclear freeze resolution by a vote of 278149. Now. we must continue our work. More than 75 percent of my mail is against any funding for the MX. To quote from one line: ""Theres a pretty big group that wants to put a stop to this war toytheyre called taxpayers."" As we carry out our deliberations today. we do so in a nation where 20 million are left unemployed and our economy continues to hemorrhage due to deficits partially driven by defense spending. We are reminded of the words of a fivestar general. Dwight Eisenhower. who said spending of Americas wealth for rockets is the ""spending of the sweat of (Americas) laborers. the genius of its scientists. the hopes of its children."" May 24: 1983 CO. We should not underrate the substantial military strength of the Soviet or their global desires. However. wasting billions of precious dollars on a program of dubious value will not make us stronger or safer. or better able to deter the Soviets. In fact. experts believe it will do the oppositeand it will wreak further havoc on our economy. We have to make hard choices to get the most out of our tax dollars. MX Is a waste of those dollars."
980122682,Mr. Chairman. I would like to add my remarks to those of my distinguished colleagues in opposition to the amendment. The Judiciary Committee. In representing the views of the Justice Department In opposing section 11(d) have attempted to portray this provision as something unique. something which will uindermine some existing system of centralized litigation authority. It is understandable that the Justice Department would like to have total control over all governmental litigation. Of course. the first objective of any bureaucracy is to increase and protect Its turf. and the Department of Justice is no exception. The Issue here is not protection of bureaucratic turf but protection of the health and safety of Americans living on or near hazardous waste dump sites. In considering this provision. two important points should be kept in mind: First. legislation giving Federal agencies limited litigation authority Is not unique. According to a 1979 study by the Office of Management and Budget. there are over 20 statutes authorizing over 27 departments and agencies other than the Justice Department to initiate such litigation. These Include the Department of Energy Organization Act. the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. and three specific environmental laws already administered by EPAthe Federal Water Pollution Control Act. the Clean Air Act. and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Second. section 11(d) does not strip the Department of Justice of litigation authority. It merely provides a safety valve in the current system to protect. the public health and safety when the Department of Justice bureaucracy fails to act In a timely manner. So that Members further understand the real need for this. I would. like to remind my colleagues of the details of one recent case. the Mountain View Mobile Home Estates case in Globe. Ariz.. already referred to by the gentleman from Tennessee. In that case. about 130 residents were living directly on top of an asbestos dump site. Several Federal and State authorities warned of the sertous health risks created by direct con. tact with a known carcinogen. ..the Agency has determined that there may be an Imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment because of An actual or threatened release of hazardous substances from the site. Due to the nature and level of exposure to asbestos at the Mountain View Mobile Home Estates site. In Its re rerral. EPA requested that this referral be the subject of prompt action. There was no action taken in response to this request for over 7 months after the referral. Why? Because the attorney assigned to the Globe case was busy with other work and either did not have time or was simply unwilling to do the filing. Meanwhile. residents remained exposed to a known carcinogen. This inaction is unconsionable and can hardly be called a beneficial aspect of a centralized litigation systemnit is no isolated instance in fact. It is a too common pitfall. If we continue this system and. therefore. allow these kinds of cases to go unfiled. we will seriously jeopardize the health and safety of the American public. The amendment proposed by the gentleman from New Jersey Is an attempt to block a provision of H.R. 2867 which specifically addresses this problem. This provision gives EPA the ability to litigate cases on its own once the Justice Department has had ample time to prosecute. but has failed to do so. What can be more simple. proper. Just? EPA must have the authority to step In and take effective action when the Justice Department fails to. The people of this countrythe people in your districtcannot be expected to sit around. waiting for the attorneys over at Justice to clear their desks long enough to file a preliminary injunction. while good Americans live in hazardous waste and. are exposed to hazardous materials affecting their organs and blood. Americans deserve the quickest. most effective relief the system can provide. and that is what section 11(d) of H.R. 2867 does. I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment and. therefore. preserve the publics Interest.
980137523,Mr. Speaker. the most difficult. thankless yet most noble struggles in American history have been those to achieve simple equality. Tradilional discussions of those struggles have focused on the great numbers: 200.000 killed in our Civil War. 25 miliion blacks. 70 million Catholics. 120 million women. But as I began niy day this morning. as I washed my 21/-yearold daughters face and combed her hair and fixed her Checrios and tied her sneakers. I thought of her future. Without equal rights for women protected by our Constitution. she can and will be denied an equal education. She can and will be cheated of 41 cents of every dollar of her rightful comnpensation for a job well done. She can and wvill be discouraged from certain careers. iike sitting in this body. And she can and will be dispossessed of her rightful future. God gave her certain talents. certain intelligence. and God knows Amnerica needs the unfettered contributions of all Its children. Trhis amendment for equal rights will help secure it. Womens poverty is due to two causes that are basically femalewomen are disadvantaged in the labor market and women must often support and pay for child care for their children mostly if not totally on their own. Women often bear the economic as well as the emotional burden of rearing their child or children or caring for an older parent. Many poor women irust also deal with a social welfare system that was originally designed for men. a system which often exacerbates rather than reduces womens poverty. Th. equal rights amendment will stimulate ain examination of the disadvantaging impact of government welfare programs on poor women. it will stimulate the beginning of the process of creating a welfare system that will help reverse the feminization of poverty and help create new economic opportunities for women. The equal rights amendment wvill help strengthen prohibitions against discrimination in the market place. And in domestic relations law. under the equal rights amendment. laws and court orders will be based on the principle that each spouse contributes equally to the marriage. It will validate the view of mar-
980207739,Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to support Congressman HowARDS amendment. The statistics surrounding drunk driving are horrendous: One out of every two Americans will be involved in an alcoholrelated auto crash in his or her lifetime. The No. 1 cause of death for people under the age of 35 in America is drunk driving. Of the 25.000 Americans who die each year from alcoholrelated traffic accidents. over 10.000that is 40 percentare under the age of 21. When a drunk driver turns the ignition key. it is like loading a dangerous weapon. Thousands and thousands of innocent children and adults are slaughtered or maimed by someone who decided that he or she (and in 80 percent it is a he) could handle a car after drinking. Fortyfour percent of fatal alcoholrelated crashes at night are caused by people between age 16 and 24. Thousands of teenagers are crippled or suffer other serious injuries because of drunk drivers. It is time for Congress to face up to these statistics. As a Minnesota State senator. I authored two major laws that made Minnesota one of the toughest States in the Nation on drunk driving. As a result. there has been a 32percent decline in alcoholrelated deaths since 1981. When we lowered the voting age. I was not convinced a higher drinking age was a good idea. I felt we did not have the data showing it would make a difference. that parents were trying to shirk their responsibilities and magically resolve a complex social problem by simple legislation. There still is a lot of that wishful thinking around but it is just too plain from study after study. State after State: raising the age saves lives. Kids do not kill themselves and othersat least there are major reductions in drunk driving accidents involving young peoplewhen the age is a uniform 21. I consider myself fortunate as a 35yearold Anerican to get a second chance to save the lives of all the future victims of drunk drivers. I hope that todays vote is only the first of many as we consider the Presidential Commissions reconimendations. We will have succeeded in this area only when no person who has been drinking will drive. and we will accomplish that through real concern from family and friends. strictly enforced. publicly supported. tough drunk driving laws. and compassionate but honest treatment programs.

970043066,Mr. Chairman. if the gentleman from Montana will yield. and if I may complete my statement for the gentleman from New York . the first part of my amendment really addressed portions B and Cno funds will be used to promote. defend. or protect homosexuality. A homosexual could not seek legal aid if he was discriminated against based upon his sexual orientation by either a legal aid society or an outside employer. landowner. and so forth. It has been interpreted and written so that it would be interpreted to stop forced acceptance of open homosexual conduct. If an individual openly professes this conduct and is discriminated against. we do not want him to have legal aid in Iis defense to compel acceptance of his open conduct. If. on the other hand. he keeps his conduct to himself and does not bring it into issue. then he can walk into any legal aid society as a private individual and get help on a traffic ticket or assault case or even be hired by them. A homosexual who wants help on a traffic ticket can now be discriminated against. This sounds terrible but a crucial question must be asked. Who was responsible for bringing into issue the mans homosexuality? If the individual seeking help has done so. discrimination is consistent with our end. If the attorney from whom the help is sought InJects the issue based upon conclusive information. a consistent end is still arrived at. If the attorney injects the issue based upon mere suspicion and the person is discriminated against. his position is no worse than one which any of us might find ourselves in simply because another individual doesnt like the way we look. The long and the short of the matter is that those who openly profess and promote homosexual conduct do not deserve protection of that conduct under law. This is my intention. If they want to keep their conduct in their private lives and not bring it into issue publicly. they have the same rights as any other individual for protection under law whether it be help on a traffic ticket. a case of assault. robbery. or whatever. My amendment stops any public promotion of homosexual conduct. Defeating the promulgation of the regulations has the same effect. Any individual who brings into issue his homosexual conduct cannot receive protection under law. If they keep their conduct to themselves. they obviously have the same rights of any other individual in society.
970076409,"I thank the chairman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. I rise In bpposition to House Concurrent Resolution 153. a resolution authorizing a statue of Martin Luther King. Jr. to be placed In the U.S. Capitol. At best. Martin Luther Kings prior associations and activities are questionable. Until all Information is available. passage of this measure could prove an embarrass. ment to this Congress and the American people. Under court order in 1877. the FBIs surveillance records and tapes on Reverend King were sealed iri the Nationai Archives for 50 years or until the year 2027. The supporters of this resolution might want to ask themselves why this action was taken? Before acting prematurely. we should either request that the records be made available or delay consideration until the information is released. At tis point in time we should not authorize putting a statue of Martin Luther King. Jr.. In a place of honor In our Nations Capitol until all the facts are before us. Rev. Martin Luther King. Jr.. who professed nonviolence. In fact was wedded to violence. He sought out violence: lie courted and provoked violence against his followers and by his followers because he believed violence was necessary to the achievement of his ends. Reverend King said its much in an article he wrote for the Saturday Review of April 3. 1965. In this article he wrote: The goal of the demonstrations In Selma. as elsewhere. is to dramatize the existence of Injustice and to bring about the presence of Justice by methods of nonviolence. He continued by writing that that goal can be achieved when four things occur: 1. Nonviolent demonstrators go Into the streets to.- excerclse their constitutional rights. 2. Racists resist them by unleashing violence against them. 3. Americans of conscience in the name of decency demand federal Intervention and legislation. 4. The Administration. under mass pressure. initiates measures of Immediate intervention and remedial legislation. In other words. the demonstrations were a staged media event. a dramatization to attract the newspaper reporters and television cameramen and make a local event into a national Issue. But the second necessary ingredient for Reverend Kings scenario was violence. In communities where ad hoc gangs of thugs did not appear to attack demonstrators. night marchers were staged to lure out nightriders. And when all else failed to provoke violence. demonstrators led by Reverend King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference deliberately violated the laws by holding marches and parades without permits. violating court injunction and provoking police officers. In some areas such as Birmingham and Selma. Reverend King was successful in provoking the violence he felt was necessary for him to win his goals. During the Albany. Ga.. protests In 1962. where the law enforcement authorities avoided confrontation despite provocations. King generated little publicity. When he was eventually arrested leading an Illegal demcnstration In July. Reverend King refused to pay the fine so that he could remain in Jail as a socalled martyr. After a black man paid Reverend Kings fine and he had to leave jail. he called the event having been ""kicked out of jail."" In Birmingham. Reverend King welcorned truant students from high schools and even younger Into the demonstrations although they were In great danger. Let us remember what he said after the mnurder of four young girls attending Sunday school In a bomb explosion and after two teenaged boys were shot to death during the riot that followed. In the Nation of March 9. 1964. Reverend King wrote: The keys to victory In Birmingham were the refusal to be intimidated. the Indomitable spirit or Negroes to endure. their willingness to fill the jails. their ability to love their childrenand take them by the hand Into battle. to leave on that battlefield six murdered Negro children. to suffer the grief. and resist demoralization and provocation to violence. And so for Reverend King. ""six murdcred Negro children"" were ""keys to victory."" In other words. martyrs helped him achieve his ends and he saw this. and he deliberately continued to court violence. In his book. ""Why We Cant Wait."" Reverend King wrote: Looking back. it Is clear that the introduction of Birminghams children into the campaign was one of the wisest moves we made. But the New York Times editorially disagreed. stating thatThe presence of hundreds of children among the marchers made all these marches especially perilous adventures in brinksnianship. It Is also appropriate to question whether or not R~ev. Martin L. King. Jr.. really found racism repugnant In light of his support of discrimination in jobs and housing so long as the dis5crimination was in favor of blacks. In light of the formation in February 190. in Chicago of what Reverend King called a common front with the violenceoriented. virulently racist Nation of Islam (NOD) or Black Muslins. and In light of the statements of some of Reverend Kings closest aides such as Rev. James Bevel. During the 1963 Birmingham disorders. Reverend Bevel told students: We need an army of captains and sergeants and privates to fight the white men this summer. I want captains to march whole schools to jail after graduation. While Reverend King did not advocate race hatred. he did not bar alliances with racists and he did not keep them from his personal staff. In 1966 during the Chicago housing campaign. the association of Reverend King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference with violence was even more open. Whith Reverend Kings knowle Ige. his aide. Reverend Bevel. showed films of the violence during the Watts riots In Los Angeles to Chicago residents being recruited to participate In his equal housing campaign. Among those particularly singled out for contacts and for those film showings were the leaders and members of Chicagos notoriously violent criminal youth gangs. Reverend King told newsmen that the film showings had been intended ""to show the negative results of riot. Ing"" and to demonstrate that rioters who destroyed their own communities accomplished nothing. But that. Is not how the Chicago street gangs interpreted the films. Whenever the film showed a black rioter attacking a police officer. they cheered. And whenever law enforcement officers were shown. they hissed and booed. In fact. Reverend Bevels film shows for youth gang members were nothing other than audiovisual seminars In mayhem. One might have expected after the riot that Rev. Martin L. King. the noted advocate of nonviolence. would have broken all contact between SCLC and the gangs. but that Is not what happened. Instead Reverend King and SCLC excutive director Rev. Andrew J. Young met with the gang leaders for several hours. The gang leader.. pledged a truce and said they would ""try nonviolence."" The trace did not last till the end of that day. Five young men were shot and violence Increased to Include 2 deaths and 13 wounded so that a State curfew was Imposed 2 wveeks after the truce. As one of Rev. Martin L. King. Jr.s. critics. Dr. Joseph Harrison Jackson. then president of the National Baptist Convention. noted at the time: There Is a danger of using nonviolence in such a way that it will create violence. One of these ways is to teach the young contempt for the law. Reverend Kings ""nonviolent civil disobedience"" taught that any law an Individual personally and subjectively disagrees with or feels Is unjustly reatrictive can be arbitrarily broken at will. This Is not the lesson we should teach young Americans. but it Is the lesson we would teach them by making a hero of Rev. Martin L. King. Jr.. and by placing a statue of him in our Nations Capitol."
970082099,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from across the Potomac. I find It appalling that the District of Columbia. our Nations Capital. has abandoned the timehonored principle of choosing the best qualified candidates for available positions within the District. of Columbia Police Department and the District of Columbia Fire Department. No longer are police officers and fire department personnel selected and rewarded on the basis of their merit. but now they are chosen by chanceby luckin the form of a personnel lottery. Without question. police and fire protection are the most important and vital services that a government entity can provide. These are exceptionally difficult occupations. occupations that require a tremendous amount of skill and training and a high degree of professionalism. Therefore. those selected for these occupations should not be selected haphazardly. but should be selected using high standards and because they are the best personnel available. To make the choice In any other manner is to reduce the efficiency and the competency of these very fine departments. The selection of these key personnel by chance will result In greater danger for the residents of the District. greater danger for our constituents who are visiting the District. and much greater danger for their fellow police officers and firefighters who must risk their lives with less than the best support at their sides. The personnel lottery Is being advanced in the name of ""equal opportunity."" If there Is bias In the method or standards by which candidates are selected. then let us erradicate the problem. Equal opportunity means that all have the same opportunity to compete on an equal basis for available positions. and not having it handed to you on the basis of pure chance. The question becomes this: If you are faced with an emergency situation. would you want the person responding to your distress to be a person selected by merit and the basis of skill and ability or a person who happened to be lucky In a lottery? For that reason. I support .this amendment."
970101915,"Mr. Speaker. just last week I wrote a letter to a constituent reiterating my own position on the matter of banning handguns. or any guns for that matter. I stated In part to this constituent: There Is no logical way to blame our soaring rate of murder. armed robbery and aggravated assault on ""guns"" when It Is the ""liberal"" policy of releasing murderers. and even rewarding thenm in some instances. which is really responsible. This week. we shall find the National Coalition to Ban Handguns perpetrating their propaganda on the ""Hill"" and elsewhere on behalf of what they call ""National Handgun Awareness Week."" Although I missed it at the time. probably one of the best refutations to the ban the handgun crowd. is contained in the July 17. 1981. issue of Political Gun News. The editor and author of this publication. Morgan Norval. appropriately titles this outstanding article. ""The Cult of Nonsense."" Mr. Norval covers the subject from every aspect. and I call my colleagues special attention to the conduct of the U.S. Conference of Mayors handgun control project. as well as the reprehensible conduct of Atlanta. Ga.. officials requesting the names and addresses of all gun owners In the Atlanta area. The slayings of the black children In Atlanta was used as the excuse. despite the fact that only 1 of 28 deaths being attributed to the use of a firearm. Article by Morgan Norval follows: [From the Political Gun News. July 17. .19811 THE CULT or NONazSES Liberal antigun advocatesand most antigunners are unabashed liberalsbase their support of gun control In the form of gun bans on the premise that violent crime would be reduced If guns were outlawed. Yet when pressed on this assertion. the honest liberal will relunctantly admit that gun control would not prevent the determined crook from getting a firearm. Why. then. do they persist in attacking the gun. as they recently did in passing a handgun ban In Morton Grove. Ill? Why arent they directing their energies towards combating the individual brain controlling the trigger finger that sets of the gun? The rationale behind the liberal antigunDers thinking Is his adherence to an Ideology that is. In the final analysis. nothing more than a cult of nonsense. This cult. In simple terms. rejects the concept of individual free will. Man. according to the cult. is a passive product of his environment and not a rational thinking animal. External forces and pressures shape his destiny. Viewed in this light. It Is easy -to see why liberals attack the gun and not the person using the gun. Because it is the external stimulus of the environment that causes behavior (so they believe). corrective steps must Involve tinkering with or changing those environmental stimuli. In this process of tinkering or changing. the individual who Is supposed to be affected by the. action Is treated like a mere pawn on lifes chessboard. manipulated according to the whims of his socialengineering masters who are attempting to change his behavior. Changing his environment will. according to the theory. result in shifting the individuals behayior to that favored by the manipulators. This type of thinking Is not limited to the area of gun control. The liberals devotion to forced school busing and enforcement of racial. ethnic or sexual quotas In employment are two examples out of many that come to mind. In their approach to gun control. the liberal behavioralists solution attacks guilty and innocent alike. Instead of devoting their efforts to the apprehension and punishment of those using firearms for evil and violent purposeswhich would seem to be a rational. common sense approachthe liberals solution Is to abolish guns. They would treat like criminals the overwhelming number of lawabiding American gun owners because of the evil deeds of a min~iscule number of criminals. The fact that the armed criminal is not about to hand over his gun doesnt seem to bother the liberal antigunner. In fact all the antigunner will have accomplished is to eliminate some of the risk Involved in criminal activity: The unarmed potential victim will be at the mercy of his armed assailant. Forget for a moment the vacuity of -the liberals philosophy and examine their current rhetoric. Almost on cue. whenever there Is a shooting of a famous Individual. their clamor for more gun control risesof ten as not accompanied by such statements as that ours Is a sick society. etc. In view of their belief that man is the passive product of his environment. this is a logical statement. After all. if a man Is the product of his environment and he did an evil deed. there must have been something rotten about the environment that caused him to act as he did. This defect. then. must be rectified to prevent future evil acts. The massive flaw in this reasoning is the fact that not all those who share the same environment commidt evil deeds. In fact. only a tiny portion of them do. For example..less than 1 gun owner in 3.000 ever commits murder. Of those who do murder. over twothirds have prior arrest records for major felonies. Since many of these prior felonies were directed against relatives and friends. the high twothirds percentage Is probably understated. as friends and relatives are less likely to press charges. Also. police often dismiss these Incidents as ""family disputes."" It is Intriguing to note that In close to 00 percent of domestic homicides. the police had been to the home at least once before to stop violent assaults. In half of these cases. the police had been there at least five times. One can reasonably conclude that murderers are clearly violent people with violent pasts. Now. if the antigunners theory were correct. something would have to be wrong with the 2.999 out of 3.000 American gun owners who dont use their guns to murder people. Are these nonmurdering gun owners therefore psychotic? You would think so If. and only if. you accept the theoretical basis of the antigunners rationale: The dominant influence of environmental factors on a persons behavior. Of course. it is patent nonsense to even think that the 2.999 -out of 3.000 norunurdering gun owners are psychotic. Yet. if you I accept the antigunners cult of nonsense. what other conclusion could you reach? If we in the progun movement do not expose the liberal antigunners cult of non. sense for the senselessness that it is. then. as sure as night follows day. we can look forward to numerous handgun bans springing up throughout the nation. When that happens. It will be Just a matter ortime before our Second Amendment right to own f irearms disappears. ~ We In the progun movement must convince the vast majority of the people that our approach to the problem is the logical. rational approach. We. as progunners. view crime as the work of individuals making a free choice. Individuals commit criminal acts such as rape. robbery and murder because they choose to do so. Since man Is a rational animal. he should be made responsible for his choices. Recognizing this. it Is logical that the progunners efforts should focus on those who have chosen crime as a career. We progunners support efforts (swift. sure punishment. for example) to deter or remove dangerous Individuals from our midst. while rejecting policies such as licensing. registration and gun bans that punish the vast majority of lawabiding American gun owners. A human being. after all. Is the only creature on this planet that possesses a thinkIng. rational mind. This gives man the ability to pick and choose his actions. something other animals lack. The fact that most violent crime Is committed by repeat offenders shows that these people have no reluctance. at present. toward continuing a life of crime. They are. In fact. making conscious decisions to continue their careers of depredation. We must stress over and over that It Is the Individual criminal. not society. who should be held responsible for his criminal deeds. We must reject out of hand the liberal antigunners cult of nonsense. To sum up: The progun viewpoint treats each person as an Individual who is responsible for his acts. while the liberal antigunner treats the Individuals as a robot that responds to the whims of his societal environment. America owes Its greatness to the creative ingenuity of individual citizens exercising free choice and judgment. Americas present decline can be traced. to the overreliance of the past 40 to 50 years on the collectivist cult of nonsense. which Is epitomized by their thoughts on gun control."
970148996,"Mr. Speaker. ""de mortuis nil nisi bonum."" Of the dead. say nothing but good. I for one must dissent from that sentiment. The legislation that we are now considering would authorize a study. costing between $100.000 and $150.000. to create and dedicate a memorial to a man. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. For my colleagues who argue that this legislation commemorates a ""commitment to the eradication of physically disabling diseases."" I suggest that this bill is another in a growing number of bills before this body to commemorate the myth that F. D. R. saved our free enterprise system from going socialist and saved the world from a totalitarIan dictatorship. Nothing could be further from the truth. To separate the myth from the reality and to understand the effects of F. D. R.s Presidency. one must first consider the cause of the conditions which existed when he appeared on the Washington scene and the results that have flowed from the policies by which he altered the direction of our economy and the shape of the world. During the first century of our Nations exsistence we retained our system of free enterprise with only a few exceptions. Perhaps the greatest breach was the monopoly granted to the railroads. but by and large. we entered the 20th century..with a system of free enterprise which. with a sound gold standard. enabled our people to enjoy higher living standards. prosperity. and longer life spans than the world had ever known. Then in 1913. a most far reaching change was imposed on our economy and the financial structure of our nation. That change was the creation of the Federal Reserve System with limited powers to manipulate the Nations quantity of money and thus the value of the U.S. dollar and every contract expressed in dollars. With the advent of World War I. the originally limited powers were expandedand the system became a facility for financing the Governments war debts. It did this by roughly doubling the quantity of money in the economy. In bhort. by inflation. with all the undesirable results that accompany inflation. At the end of the war. the inflation was temporarily reversed and the ensuing deflation resulted in the readJustment recession of 192021. However. the Federal Reserve System soon resumed its inflation of the quantity of money. All such political expansions of money and credit always derange the economy. The introduction of the new dollars into the economy leads to a boom in those businesses that sell to the recipients of the new money. leaving less for those who have only their earnings and savings to spend. We were then on a form of the gold standard that placed a limit on the expansion of money and credit. All such inflations must end sooner or later. This inflation ended in 1928. When the quantity of money and bank credit stopped expanding. the former spenders of the newly created dollars were forced to reduce their spending. The stock market collapsed in 1929 and many bank loans were called. In a short period of time the Nations outstanding quantity of money was contracted by onethird. The situation called for a drop in wage rates and prices and a readjustment of the economy. This could have been accomplished with the least pain and in the shortest period of time with the help of freely fluctuating market prices. wage rates. and interest rates. Such market barometers and ther mometers direct businessmen to use all available capital. labor. and material goods to produce that mixture of goods and services which best meet the demands of consumers. Unfortunately. there was a largescale attempt to maintain 1929 prices and wage rates with only about twothirds the quantity of money that had supported the prices and wage rates of 1928 and 1929. Consequently. many businesses failed and millions lost their jobs. This was the situation when F. D. R. assumed the Presidency after campaigning against a profligate government. His very first act was to confiscate the gold of our citizens and unleash the inflation we are now having much difficulty in bringing to an end. In a very short period of time he persuaded Congress to create a series of Government agencies and programs. These not only blocked a market correction of the chaotic results of the inflation follies of the twenties. but it made matters infinitely worse with a resumption of inflation in an attempt to achieve the quantity of money that F. D. R. hoped would maintain the prices and wage rates that preceded the depression. The Supreme Court threw out two of F. D. R.s basic antifree market measures. the National Recovery Act (NRA) and the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) in 1935. It also held that neither F. D. R. nor Congress had the power to annul the ""Gold Clause"" promise. then a part of all U.S. Government securities. while letting F. D. R. off the hook by holding that the bondholders had not at that time. 1935. proven that they had suffered any loss. Undaunted. F. D. R. had Congress reenact key provisions of the unconstitutioral NRA and AAA. while also withdrawing the right of holders of Government securities to sue the Government and prove their losses as the purchasing power of the dollar started to fall. He then attempted to pack the Supreme Court. Congress refused to go along. but by 1937 he had a subservient Court which from that date on. in case after case. overturned the original and traditional constitutional limitations on an allpowerful central govenment. Rarely did a piece of New Deal legislation achieve its advertised goal. but all Involved a still greater concentration of power in the hands of the Federal Government. By 1939. his expanded powers and programs were in full effect. F. D. R. had also inflated the nations quantity of money by some 50 percent. surpassing the figures of 1928 and 1929. However. he failed to achieve the prosperity he sought evn with the Federal Reserve discount rate at only 1 percent. After the Wagner Actsection 7a of the NRAwas held to be Constitutional by a. 5 to 4 vote. unemployment soared. automobile production was cut almost in half. the iron and steel production index dropped drastically. and railroad freight loadings fell by almost onefourth. The Treasurys tax collection had almost tripled. while the public debt had been doubled and the newly imposed social security taxes were all spent before $1 in benefits had been paid. This was not a free market society and neither was it prosperity. Hitler soon brought temporary relief. When he attacked Poland. England and France went to the rescue. With many of their men in uniform. they had great needs in a hurry. They turned to the United States. Our neutrality Act then specified that all trade with nations at war must be on a cash and carry basis. So the gold of France and Great Britain put our people back to work and the wheels of industry hummed. It was too good to last. France fell in June 1940 and Britains money ran out. F. D. R. met this dilemma by breaking tradition and running for a third term. While promising the electorate again and again that our boys were not going to fight in any foreign wars. he secretly assured the British he would help them. but they would have to wait until after the election. In his first press conference after the election. he announced what later became known as lend lease. This aid to the warring nations and an expanded armament program kept the wheels of Industry spinning. with taxes. deficits and the public debt reaching new highs. while the Federal Reserve System speeded up its creation of dollars. that is inflation. F. D. R. while publicly proclaiming neutrality before the 1940 election. had ordered our Navy to report and follow German submarines until the British arrived. sent our servicemen to assist the British. secretly established the first hotline telephone with the British Prime Minister. Winston Churchill. and maintained a secret liaison with the British agent set up in New York City to help bring us into the war. Early in 1941. top British and American staff officers met and approved joint war plans. With F. D. R.s approval. these plans were distributed to our fleet commanders early in the summer of 1941. Returning from a meeting with Churchill off Argentina in late summer. F. D. R. summoned the Japanese Ambassadors and handed them a secret ultimatum. after which he wired the British Prime Minister on August 18. 1941. ""The statement I made to him was substantially similar to the statement we discussed."" Having broker. the top Japanese diplomatic code in August 1940. F. D. R. knew on November 22. 1941. that if a satisfactory conclusion to the long drawn out negotiations with the Japanese was not reached by November 29 that ""the deadline absolutely cannot be changed. After that things are automatically going to happen."" According to Secretary of War Stimsons diary. F. D. R. told his war cabinet on November 25 that ""We were likely to be attacked perhaps as soon as next Monday."" So. on the next day. November 26. F. D. R. had his Secretary of State hand the Japanese Ambassadors a second ultimatum. one he knew they could not accept. He knew war was imminent. After reading another intercepted Japanese message on December 6. he told Harry Hopkins. ""This means war."" War came the next day and the failure of the New Deals government dominated economy was successfully hidden from a shocked American public. Thus. F. D. R. was able to fool many unsuspecting people. with little or no understanding of sound economics. into thinking that his massive political interferences with our market society had saved the system so badly deranged by the Federal Reserve Systems monetary manipulations of the previous decade. After World War II. the New Deal interferences with a free market in jobs.* wage rates. and interest rates were still in place. We have been experiencing the inevitable consequences. Labor union privileges have prevented competition for many of the higher paying jobs. thus limiting such employment as well as a higher production of the things Americans wanted most. Those shut out from union controlled jobs competed for and drove down wage rates in nonunion jobs. while an ever rising minimum wage ra* 3 prevented a growing number from getting on the bottom of the ladder. The result has been increasing iass unemployment. necessitatng increasing welfare expenditures. higher taxes and ever larger budget deficits financed in large part by the political creation and distribution of more dollars which have not only raised the cost of living for everyone but have further deranged the economy.. It might be said that two of F. D. R.s economic programs were great successes. His attempt to inflate the Nations quantity of money reached his goal before World War II and is still going full blast. In 1981. the Federal Reserve System increased the M. quantity of money by roughly 10 percent. F. D. R.s other success was his program for unemployment insurance. His programs have certainly insured unemployment. At the beginning of 1982. the American taxpayers were paying more than 4 million people not to work or contribute to our society. These were not exactly the results F. D. R. sought. In his 1848 Communist manifesto. Karl Marx stated the way to socialism is ""to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State. This cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property by means of measures. therefore. which appear economically insufficnent and untenable. but which. in the course of the movement. outstrip themselves. necessitate further inroads upon the old social order. and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production."" Marx then listed 10 measures that ""will be pretty generally applicable."" P. D. R. endorsed and took steps toward advancing 8 of those 10 measures. It is interesting to note that on the 100th anniversary of his birth. the magazine Soviet Life. which is published by the Soviet Embassy. took the occasion to acknowledge that it was F. D. R. who almost singlehandedly saved the Soviet Union from collapse in 1933 by establishing relations with that country and thus ""productJ positive results for the cause of peace."" One such result for which F. D. R. is praised is the Yalta agreement. in which. among other conditions. the Soviet Union was guaranteed domination of Eastern Europe. including. Poland. In addition. the article praises F. D. R. for his ""important socioeconomic reforms that greatly changed life in America."" The article concludes with: ""President Roosevelt was an example of the other sides generally correct position in SovietAmerican relations. He understood. better than anyone else in U.S. ruling circles. the best way to deal with the U.S.S.R. He proved to be much more astute than all the experts on Russia and the Russia soul."" With friends like Soviet Life. the memory of F. D. R. needs no. enemies. In conclusion. F. D. R.s basic interference with free market procedures and his international treachery have led to the further disintergration of the ways of Western civilization. They thus must bear a major responsibility for our present distressing economic situation with soaring inflation. interest rates. mass unemployment. and current world crises. Contrary to the claims of some that F. D. R. saved capitalism. it must be realized that present economic problems are the result of political interferences. many initiated by F. D. R.. which have hampered the free flow of capital. labor. and new savings into those employments. which best reflect the wishes of consumers. Only a return to free market prices. wages. and interest rates operating with a sound unmanipulated monetary system can revive the prosperity of a free society. In view of the record and a hard look not at the myth but at the reality. I submit that we do not need another memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. We already have a lasting memorial: the U.S.S. Arizona. lying at the bottom of Pearl Harbor."
970163253,"Mr. Speaker. in my view. the Reagan administration has been too timid in its policy on China. My strong feeling has been that we should officially recognize the Republic of China in some fashion and restore our official ties with our longtime ally. In my view. our policymakers do not understand the fact that the Peoples Republic of China needs us much more than we need them. Therefore. I was pleased when I received a copy of House Resolution No. 19 from the House of Representatives of the State of Mississippi asking the President to restore official relations with the Republic of China and to provide specific security guarantees for that nation. I comnend the text of this resolution to my colleagues and our policymakers here in Washington as typical of ""grassroots"" sentiments in America today. STATE OF MissIssIppi: HOUSE RESOLUTION . No. 19 Whereas. the Republic of China is a longtime friend. ally and trade partner of the United FiE. . and Whereas. the Republic of China holds a pivotal. strategic position in Asia and the West Pacific which is vitally important to the interest and the defense of the United States. and Whereas. the people of the Republic of China enjoy a democratic way of life. a high standard of living and fundamental human rights. and Whereas. continued trade with the Republic of China is vitally important to the State of Mississippi and the United States: Now. . therefore. be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Mississippi. That we do hereby memorialize President Ronald W. Reagan to establish official government relations with the Republic of China. and that we do hereby memorialize the Congress of the United States to take all necessary actions to provide specific security guarantees for the Republic of China.

That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States. the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States and to each member of Congress of the United States."
970188370,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Committee on Armed Services amendments to the legislation cited as the Small Business Innovation Act of 1982. The amendments proposed by the Committee on Armed Services: First. would exclude the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Central Intelligence Agency from the term ""Federal agency"" for the purposes of H.R. 6587. and second. would exclude the funds appropriated for atomic energy defense programs of the Department of Energy from the research and R. & D. budget of that department for the purposes of the small business innovation research program defined in H.R. Mr. Chairman. the stated purpose of H.R. 6587 is to amend the Small Business Act to strengthen the role of the small. innovative firm in federally funded research and development. to utilize Federal research and development as a base for technological innovation to meet agency needs. and to contribute to the growth and strength of the Nations economy. The Committee on Armed Services strongly agrees with this purpose. However. the committee does not agree with the approach incorporated in this legislation. In fiscal year 1981 the Department of defense awarded 7.4 percent of its prime research and development contracts to small business. Almost all of those awards were for hardcore research and development. The vast majority of these contracts were awarded as a result of open fair competition. Thus. small innovative businesses have successfully competed in the marketplace when pitted against medium- and largesized businesses. The bill considered would allow only small businesses to bid on certain contracts. thus. H.R. 6587 would thwart the efforts currently undertaken to maximize competition. In the hearings before the Research and Development Subcommittee. the witnesses were in agreement that this program is a beneficial program for small business. although some believe various changes should be made. The small business programs in the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy are very effective in stimulating small business participation in these agencies activities. H.R. 6587 would disrupt these highly successful programs and require that they be completely restructured. Furthermore. essentially all of the funding for the Department of Energy atomic energy defense program must be provided directly to the federar.y funded Governmentowned contractoperated (GOCO) facilities that include seven fabricating facilities and three weapons laboratories. Research. development. design. and testing of nuclear weapons prototypes and the manufacture of nuclear weapons on the Department of Energy atomic energy defense program take place at the GOCOs. Small business is not equipped to handle the highly classified equipment and radioactive materials necessary in the design. development. and testing of nuclear weapons. However. due largely to the efforts of the Department of Energy. more than 500 highly qualified and certified small businesses are awarded subcontracts each year for specialized parts and equipment for use in the nuclear weapons and naval propulsion programs. In addition to the receipt of prime contract awards. small businesses are receiving an increasing share of subcontract research and development awards. The Department of Defense recently surveyed 36 of its largest prime contractors. Of the dollars received by these prime contractors. small business received 6.6 percent of that money in. bcontract awards. Furthermore. both the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy have established small business programs. For example. the Department of Defense has instituted the defense small business advanced technology program. known as the DESAT program. The purpose of DESAT is to exploit the innovative capabilities of this Nations small sclence- and technologybased companies in providing solutions to some of the difficult research and development problems confronting the Department of Defense. In support of this program. DOD recently mailed approximately 32.000 copies of the program opportunities brochure (holdup brochure). The small business R. & D. community responded with 1.103 proposals. To date 100 firms have been selected for contract awards as a result of this program. The Committee on Armed Services is fully supportive of increasing the Nations overall technology and enhancing the environment for small business. but the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy should be able to continue to expand their already successful small business programs as presently structured. I would strongly urge. therefore. that you support the Committee on Armed Services amendments to allow these programs to continue as they currently exist. Mr. Chairman. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California ."
970197301,"Mr. Chairman. ""de mortuis nil nisi bonum."" Of the dead. say nothing but good. I for one must dissent from that sentiment. The legislation that we are now considering would authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior to construct the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington. D.C.. at an estimated cost of $31 million with an annual maintenance cost of approximately $1 million. In addition to the untimeliness of spending this enormous amount of money when we are attempting to reduce our overbloated Federal budget. this bill is another in . a growing number of bills before this body to commemorate the myth that F. D. R. saved our free enterprise system from going socialist and saved the world from a totalitarian dictatorship. Nothing could be further from the truth. Historical records show the following: When F. D. R. assumed the Presidency. he reputiated campaign promises and the 1932 Democratic Party platform which called for a 25percent reduction in the size of the Federal Government and instead introduced a multitude of alphabet agencies to regulate all aspects of life. His very first act as President was to confiscate the gold of our citizens and unleash the inflation we are now having much difficulty in bringing to an end. Two of F. D. R.s basic antifree market measures. the National Recovery Act (NRA) and the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). which are slatedfor inclusion on the memorial. were found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Undaunted. F. D. R. had Congress reenact key proviJuly 1.4. 1982 sions of the unconstitutional NRA and AAA. Due to these Court decisions. Mr. Roosevelt attempted to pack the Supreme Court. and by 1937 he had a subservient Court which from that date on. in case after case. overturned the original and traditional constitutional limitations on an allpowerful central government. By 1939. his expanded powers. and programs were in full effect. However. rarely did New Deal legislation achieve its advertised goal. but all involved a greater concentration of power in the hands of the Federal Government. Only the most catastrophic of events could save F. D. R.s programs from complete and utter failure: World War II. While running for an unprecedented third term. F. D. R. -promised the electorate again and again that our boys were not going to fight in any foreign wars. However. he secretly assured the British he would help them. but they would have to wait until after the election. Having broken the top Japanese diplomatic code in August 1940. F. D. R. knew on November 22. 1941. that if a satisfactory conclusion to the long drawn out negotiations with the Japanese was not reached by November 20 that ""the deadline absolutely cannot be changed. After that things are automatically going to happen."" On November 25. F. D. R. told his cabinet that ""We are likely to be attacked. perhaps. as soon as next Monday."" So. on November 26. F. D. R. had his Secretary of State hand the the Japanese Ambassador a second ultimatum. one he knew they could not accept. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor 10 days later. on December 7. Two of F. D. R.s economic programs may be viewed as great successes. His attempt to inflate the Nations quantity of money reached his goal before World War II and is still going full blast. F. D. R.s other success was his program for unemployment insurance. His programs have certainly insured unemployment. . On the 100th anniversary of Franklin Roosevelts birth. the magazine Soviet Life. which is published by the Soviet Embassy. took the occasion to acknowledge that it was F. D. R. who almost singlehandedly saved the Soviet Union from collapse in 1933 by establishing relations with that country and thus ""produced positive results for the cause of peace."" One such result from which F. D. R. is praised is the Yalta Agreement in which. among other conditions. the Soviet Union was guaranteed domination of Eastern Europe. including Poland. In addition. the article praises F. D. R. for his ""important socioeconomic reforms. that greatly changed life in America."" With - friends like Soviet Life. the memory of F. D. R. needs no enemies. In conclusion. F. D. R.s basic interference with free market procedures and his international treachery have let to the further disintegration of the"
970201461,Mr. Speaker. I rise to oppose the Boeing 747 aid plan because we are refusing to accept our responsibility to admit the true purpose of this measure. We can spend additional hours debating the military usefulness of the C5B over the 747. but that is not the real question. Clearly. the 747 cannot perform the critically needed outsize airlift mission and we have a critical shortage in that type capability. The real question we are debating today is whether or not the U.S. *1 House of Representatives is going to use the Defense authorization bill as a vehicle to assist the economically ailing airline industry. Mr. Speaker. I submit that we should not. I do not question the fact that many of our Nations airlines are in financial difficulty. I do not question whether the U.S. House of Representatives should address this problem and. possibly. provide some relief. But if we are going to aid the airlines. let us admit it up front. Let us conduct hearings on the impact of airline deregulation. Let us analyze the facts. Let us make concrete proposals on that issue and that issue alone. Let us not jeopardize a vital military mission for the sake of expediency on an entirely separate issue. Granted. the purchase of used 747 airplanes would provide cash for ailing airlines and. possibly. allow them to purchase more efficient aircraft. By the same token the Air Force would be crippled with a fleet of used commercial airplanes that are incapable of performing the defined military mission. There is another aspect of this proposed purchase that has not been discussed fully. Thirteen of the surplus 747s are not owned by domestic airlines. They are owned by the manufacturer. the Boeing Co. Eight of the airplanes have been traded in by international carriers. Sale of these airplanes would aid the cashstrapped Boeing Co. So. even if we admit that this plan really is an aid package for the airline industry. let us make sure that we fully understand the intplications of the proposed procurement. If adopted. 01is amendment could achieve many actions. Some domestic airlines would receive cash for surplus airplanes. Those airlines that are not fortunate enough to have excess 747s will have their competitors subsidized. The airplanes manufacturer could sell excess 74Ts for which they have no other customers. We can accomplish all this by merely ignoring the fact that we would erode further a seriously deficient airlift capability. To me. the losers. should we take such action as passing the 747 aid plan. would be the American taxpayer and our military personnel whose very lives will depend upon our ability to get necessary firepower and equipment where it needs to be and in time. The only logical choice in this matter is to defeat the proposed amendment and proceed with the recommendations contained in the Defense authorization bill.
970211473,"Mr. Chairman. this morning we have had individuals suggesting that because the Soviets do something that we should not. I think is so many areas that is a correct policy. The Soviets have certainly moved toward the concentration of all their educational system under one center. I think we should not follow that lead. The Soviets have certainly moved toward collectivization of virtually every segment of that society. I think we make a great mistake when we follow that lead. For the last 22 years we have been operating under a civil defense policy that can be honestly characterized as MAD. under the acronym of MAD. for mutual assured destruction. Beginning with the McNamara period. it was our policy that our people. undefended. would act as hostages to our good behavior and the Soviet citizenry. undefended. would act as hostage to their good behavior. In the dusty pages of Project Rand. dated in 1960. we read: ""Hardening of civil defense instead of deterring an enemy might make a preemptive attack by him more likely."" suggesting that we should not move toward civil defense. but interestingly. the very next sentence of that Rand Report is: What conclusions could we draw if the Russians initiated a really large scale effort in the construction of deep shelters? That is exactly what they have done. They have destabilized that concept of MAD. mutual assured destruction. because they have opted for a massive civil defense deepshelter evacuation program. Now. in the 19th century there were those who felt that the wooden ships offered adequate protection on the high seas until someone came up with an ironclad ship and one ironclad could conceivably defeat an entire fleet of wooden ships. Defensive measures changed the policies of war. Then in World War I. prior to that conflict. there were great academic thinkers that said that the war could only last for 3 days because of the development of the machinegun. that so many people would be killed that they would run out of troops in three days. Then someone dug a trench. We moved into trench warfare and World War I lasted not 3 days. but for years. Prior to World War II there were some great academic thinkers that said the war could only last 2 weeks because of longrange strategic bombers that would wipe out population centers. wipe out the industrial areas. but then we found with the dispersion of industy and sheltering of people that World War II ground on. not for 2 weeks. but for years. We have visited countries of Ireland. Norway. Israel. and Switzerland. All of these countries have enacted an active civil defense program. Even Ireland has a per capita greater civil defense effort than that of the United States. In Oslo. there Is Norway. certainly not noted for any bellicose ideas. there is an active civil defense program. Civil defense Is a defensive program that works. For those whose scientific understanding goes to ""Godzilla."" ""Planet of the Apes."" or ""On the Beach."" this might sound like a nightmarish thing. but civil defense is necessary and long overdue. The Soviet manuals show that they do not believe that nuclear war is unthinkable. Given the real world situation. the people of this country need a realistic civil defense and for this reason. I strongly oppose this amendment."

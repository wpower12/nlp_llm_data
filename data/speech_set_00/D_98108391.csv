980001470,"Mr. President. we are today reintroducing the equal rights amendment. a measure that by any reasonable standard of fairness and equity should already be a part of the Constitution of the United States. The ERA is a straightforward statement of principle. ""Equality of rights under the law."" it reads. ""shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" I am very much aware that the meaning of the ERA has been grossly distorted in the minds of some Amercans by a cynical disinformation campaign. The ERA does not mean coed restrooms. It does not mean that young women will be sent into battle. And. the ERA does not by any stretch of the imagination constitute a threat to the integrity of our basic institutions. To the contrary. by reaffirming the intrinsic worth of all people. the ERA will ultimately strengthen our institutions. the family included. The ERA. Mr. President. is a matter of equity. Women. who comprise 51 percent of our population. hold only 6 percent of the management jobs in our economy. For every dollar earned by a male worker. a working woman still gets only 59 cents. And today. well over half of the married women in America are in the work force. For younger women. that figure is much higher. It is a fact. Mr. President. that sex discrimination is a tangible reality in our country today. I And it is also a fact that a constitutional remedy is the best and most effective way to bring sex discrimination to an end. The courts. for example. cannot be relied upon to provide full legal protections for women. Sexual discrimination has never been reviewed with the strict scrutiny reserved for racial or ethnic classifications under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. And it is a truism that enforcement or rights through the courts is a costly. lengthy. and difficult process. A piecemeal approach to equality. as suggested by the Reagan administration. relies on the enactment of numerous statutes and regulations to protect various aspects of womens rights. It is unworkable and unfair. This approach could never be comprehensive. It is subject over and over again to the lengthy and arduous legislative process with regard to every single issue involving womens rights. In addition. statutory rights do not have the permanence of constitutional rights. They are easier to repealJust as the present administration is trying right now to repeal equal credit and affirmative action regulations. to remove enforcement procedures for equal employment laws. and to dilute the equal education laws. Mr. President. the bottom line is that the U.S. Constitution is the body of law which contains the basic rights and protections afforded to all citizens. If we do not formally affirm the right of women to be treated equally under the law. we are in fact providing a subtle stamp of approval for discrimination against women. No public statement. no promise. no report. no assurance that women have equal rights will ever be credible in this country unless and until we are willing to formally include these rights in the basic law of the land. It is clear to me that we need the ERAwe need it because it is right. I believe that a large majority of the American people concur in that judgment. And I am confident that this time. the ERA will succeed."
980002368,"Mr. President. today we in the Senate and Representative RODINO in the House are introducing a bill to make needed substantive changes in our bankruptcy code. The bill is designed to curb .debtor abuses without imposing undue burdens on deserving debtors who. overwhelmed with debt and unexpected financial reverses. are forced to turn to the bankruptcy courts for relief. In 1978. after nearly a decade of studying the bankruptcy code. Congress enacted a major reform of our bankruptcy laws. One of the most important aims of the 1978 act was to protect debtors from abusive tactics used by many creditors. That act has not functioned perfectly. However. given our current economic crisis with unemployment at its highest since the Depression. it is essential that the basic thrust of that act be maintained. Debtors must continue to have adequate protection from creditor overreaching. Studies show that the vast majority of bankruptcies are filed by bluecollar workers between 25 and 35 years of age. who have suffered unforeseen financial reverses such as loss of job. uninsured Illness. or divorce. A case study of bandruptcies in Connecticut done by Prof. Phillip Shuchman of the Rutgers University School of Law showed that the mean annual income for those people filing for bankruptcy in 1979 was $11.744. more than $100 a month below the Bureau of Labor Statistics. lowerliving budget for the same period. Most of those in the study had unstable incomes: They were employed in marginal jobs. at an hourly wage without steady employment. In testimony before the House Subcommitee on Monopolies and Commercial Law last year. a representative of the United Auto Workers legal services plan in Newark. N.J.. presented a similar profile of the typical bankrupt his organization served. Most were hourly workers who had been laid off or had had their wages frozen and had lost other benefits as the auto industry suffered a depression. Most were onewageearner families. so there was no second income to supplement unem. ployment benefits to support families and to pay debts incurred before the layoffs. Certainly these people deserve the protections afforded them by the 1978 act. Although the bankruptcy code as amended in 1978 appears to be working effectively in most cases. some adjustments are in order. Creditors must be protected from debtors who are abusing the protections afforded them by the bankruptcy laws. Our bill is intended to correct these abuses without removing the protections needed by deserving debtors who find themselves in serious financial difficulty not of their own making and who need a ""fresh start"" free from past economic misfortunes. The bill discourages debtors from ""loading up""-buying a large quantity of goods on credit in anticipation of filing for bankruptcyby creating a rebuttable presumption that debts for personal property totaling $500 and incurred within 45 days of filing for bankruptcy are nondischargeable. It also prevents debtors filing joint petitions from using both Federal and State exemptions and sets a total limit of $4.000 on personal and household items. valued under $200 each. which may be exempted by a debtor. And. it tightens chapter 13 provisions making this chapter more equitable to all parties. A more detailed description of the bills provisions follows this statement. We believe this bill represents a sound and reasonable approach to correcting abuses of the bankruptcy law while still protecting deserving debtors from creditor overreaching. I hope the Senate will act expeditiously on these proposed bankruptcy law revisions I also believe. however. that a more pressing priority is to cure the serious constitutional defect in the bankruptcy courts identified by the Supreme Court in the Northern Pipe. line case. As assistant attorney general Jonathan Rose testified on behalf of the Department of Justice at last Mondays hearing before the Subcommittee on the Courts: The bankruptcy court system established by the 1978 act Is not longer functioning. 1 * * prompt action by Congress to restructure the bankruptcy court system is essential to return that system to a sound and workable basis. Especially given todays difficult economic times. which have thrown businesses and individuals alike into unexpected bankruptcy. we must have a forum that can effectively and decisively dispose of bankruptcy matters. It is my hope that Congress will act quickly to resolve the bankruptcy courts issue and that soon thereafter it will turn to needed changes in substantive bankruptcy law. We have attempted to strike a balance between creditor and debtor needs in this proposal. But this is not necessarily the final word with respect to problems in the bankruptcy code. We are happy to work with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and with all Interested partiesthe credit industry as well as consumer groupsin refining this legislation. Given the difficult economic situation facing our country today. it is essential that we have a bankruptcy code that is workable and fair to all concerned. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a factsheet describing the provisions in the bill be printed at this point in the REcoRD."
980006507,Mr. President. If the floor leader will allow me to express my thoughts on this subject. I have no objection to vitiating the votes on the agreedupon amendments. and I ascertain it would be a good procedure that we get on about our business in connection with this measure. I am prepared to move forward and do so. The Senator from Alaska has an amendment that may entail some debate. but I would be prepared. at least for myself. to vote on that at 3:30 or 4 p.m. this afternoon. I then hav6 an amendment that is pending. I would be prepared to vote on that immediately after the vote on the Stevens amendment. I am concerned. We have a cloture vote tomorrow. We have a limited time for debate tomorrow. I have a number of amendments that I am prepared to call up. am ready to call up. I am concerned that we are running out of time without anybody being particularly involved. But I think that cloture quite often in invoked by reason of the fact that there is some extended debate in order to bring it to a conclusion. It Is not normally invoked to preclude a Member from calling up legitimate. amendments that are germane. I do have a number of those. I am concerned that tomorrow morning when we come in at 11:30 a.m. and recess from 12 to 2 p.m.. from 2 to 4 p.m. having controlled time. I am simply attemptink to point out to the leadership that I do not think It is his intention to deny any Member from asking for a vote. I know the distinguished Senator from Utah has an amendment that he expects to call up. All of this makes me believe that we ought to get on about our business and take the amendments that are noncontroversial. debate the Stevens amendment. agree to vote on It at 4 p.m.. if that suits the leaders purposes. and debate the next amendment and vote upon that immediately thereafter. Senator HATCH has an amendment. Perhaps we can stack that up and vote on it. I know I have discussed stacking amendments. but It Is obvious that we have not moved forward today. I am willing to expedite this decision with respect to amendments. having an opportunity to call up subsequent amendments.
980035925,Mr. President. I would like to express my support for this amendment which Is of critical importance to elderly Americans. I have sponsored this amendment with Senator BAucus because I believe the savings in medicare must not come out of the pockets of senior citizens. most of whom are living on fixed incomes. The budget before us is proposing cuts of over $800 million in medicare in fiscal year 1984. The recipients of medicare should not be forced to bear the brunt of these cost cutting efforts. They have already had to pay large outofpocket increases for health care as a request of previous years cuts. Consider these facts: The medicare hospital deductible has risen almost 50 percent in the last 2 years from $204 per hospital stay in 1981 to $304 this year and it is expected to rise to $350 in 1984. Medicare part B premiums have increased 23 percent in the same period. Medicare meets only 45 percent of the elderlys health care costs. Outofpocket health care costs already consume 20 percent of an elderly persons income. Before we add more to the medical bills paid by our senior citizens. let us look to our hospital. If you do not believe the hospitals can afford any further cutbacks in medicare payments. take a look at two hospital bills I have recently obtained. A woman went into a forprofit hospital in Florida for 69 days. Her bill was $78.575. This was not to pay the doctors or the surgeonsthis was just the hospital charge. A closer look at this bill reveals some outrageous items. Every time the woman was given two Tylenol tablets. she was charged $5.70. A length of Dermicel tape cost $11.50. The total charge for this tape was $300. Sponges cost her $217. Swabs cost almost $100. Disposable pads cost $700. We must stop blaming the victim. This woman was given no choice about these supplies. She was not allowed to bring her own aspirin. sponges. Qtips and BandAids to save money. Next is a hospital bill of $26.307 for a 20day stay. Here. a 4inch Ace bandage cost $7. a 4 by 4 box of sponges cost $31. a 3 by 4 Telfa pad costs $18. and a pair of exam gloves cost $25. Elderly patients can no longer be forced to pay more and more for health care. while abuses like this continue. Let us direct our cost savings efforts where they will be most effectivedirect them to. the providers of health care. We do not need shortsighted solutions which harm the elderly. Instead. we need a systemwide cost containment approach to the problem of rising health care costs. This amendment will insure that we travel in this direction. and not in the direction of imposing further financial burdens on elderly Americans.e
980076355,"Mr. President. we knowwe know all too wellthat we are being asked to approve deployment of a deadly. dangerous nuclear missile. The MX is more dangerous than other missiles. Why? Because it is at one and the same time very powerful and very vulnerable. Three years ago. Ronald Reagan seemed to have understood this point. As a candidate. he observed that. ""We should seek a survivable""-and I emphasize the word ""survivable""""basing mode for the next generation of ICBMs. He was right. Ten years ago. Mr. President. the Department of Defense concluded that the Minuteman silos. in which the administration proposes to place the MX were vulnerable to a Soviet first strike. And what with improvement in the accuracy of Soviet missiles since 1973. that vulnerability has grown enormously. So what good is the MX? My answer to that question is. ""No goodno good at all."" The ""Peacekeeper."" What a farce. What an absurdity. What a contradiction in terms. The White House public relations men call this weapon the Peacekeeper. a weapon that certainly will not keep the peace. To the contrary. it will make the world in which we live a far more dangerous place. Why? If we know. Mr. President. that the mainstay of our landbased missile deterrent is vulnerable. we will be pushed inevitably toward a posture of launchonwarning. Thereby. we will bring the world one very major step closer to the nuclear brink. If the Soviets know that we are deploying a powerful. but vulnerable. nuclear missile. their defense planners will conclude that the United States mightJust mightbe deploying a firststrike weapon. As a result. they. too. will be pushed toward launch on warning. It does not take much imagination to see where all of this could lead. Mr. President. the Air Force has testified that our existing landbased missiles will remain fully effective through the year 2000. We are building Cruise missiles and B1 bombers. We have enormously powerful nuclear submarines. We can ""afford to wait for the development of a small. survivable landbased missile. Yet we are rushing ahead to build the MX. It makes no sense. We say that we do not have the money to provide to our frontline Army Forces the conventional weapons they will need in the event of war. We have cut back on tanks. on maintenance. on flying hours for our combat pilots. But we are going ahead with the MX missiles. Try as I might. Mr. President. I can think of no good reason for it. We have no shortage of nuclear weapons or of the means to deliver them. We gain nothing at the bargaining table from the MX. And we gain nothingin fact we losein terms of national security. Mr. President. on Armistice Day. 1948. the late General of the Army. Omar Bradley. gave a speech that could well have been made in the course of todays debate. ""With the monstrous weapons man already has."" General Bradley said. ""humanity is in danger of being trapped in this world by its moral adolescents."" ""The world."" he continued. ""has achieved brilliance without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants."" In the end. that is the challenge before us. Are we prepared to move beyond ethical infancy and scrap this programscrap it because it is a bad and dangerous idea? Or will we listen once again to those who have been telling us for so many years that we can cut back on these obscene weapons only by building more of them. Mr. President. I do not know what decision the Senate will reach on the MX. I am concerned that it will pass. that somehow it will be included. I was pleased to see that a substantially lesser number of Members of the House voted to support it yesterday. I do not know what this body will do. I wish that Everett McKinley Dirksen was on the floor today to let his oratory speak to his colleagues on that side of the aisle. But as for me. I stand where Everett Dirksen stood 20 years ago. and I will not have it said of me that. ""He knew and he would not act."""
980142055,I appreciate the position of the manger of the bill. Let me explain to my colleagues what this is all about. Under the SECs new executive compensation rulecompanies will no longer be required to provide stockholders with detailed information on the salaries and fringe benefits provided toplevel executives. That ineludes reporting on prerequisites like cars. use of the company plane. country club memberships as long as these benefits amount to less than $25.000 or 10 percent of the executives salary. Under the new SEC rule. companies will now be able to calculate the cost of all fringe benefits based on what these benefits cost the company. rather than on their actual value to the executive. In other words. the use of the company jet by an executives family can go unreported because even though it is a significant benefit for the executive. it costs the company very little. These benefits gre a major part of an executives compensation package. And these benefits cost the corporations plenty. too. Three years ago. Hartz Mountain Corp. leased cars to 21 managers at a cost of $51.000. In 1977. Eastern Airlines paid $38.000 in country club dues. I wish my colleagues to understand that there is nothing In this amendment that would in any way say that the corporation could not do these things. That very well may be jtustified action on the part of the corporation. I do not believe that Members of the Senate should be telling corporations what thcy call or cannot do for their executives. I do believe that the SEC should not be changing the rules with respect to disclosure as presently provided in the law. and. therefore. I would hope that notwithstanding the motion to table that my colleagues would recognize the full disclosure is In the best interest of developing and expanding the free enterprise system. It is good for the corporations. It is good for their stockholders. and I think it is just good business for America. Some companies provide their executives with special deals on their own products. Goodyear tire gives 40 of its top people free tires. Some companies provide their executives with free financial and legal advice and better medical benefits than what is provided to the firms other employees. Marc aind Co.. A Pittsburgh advertisIng firm. has a villa on the east coast of Spain for its top executives. And Pepsico and OwenIllinois have jointly leased a salmon stream in Iceland. Perks. large and smnall. add up. Philadelphia management consulting firm. Hay and Associates. found in a survey of 468 companies that the average $100.000 a year executive gets $30.000 in fringe benefits. So. Mr. President these perks are certainly a big deal to corporations and their executives. They are also extremely important to stockholders at large. These investors deserve to know how corporate funds are being used. But. Mr. President. with the new SEC rule many of these perks will be hidden from stockholders. And the wveakening of disclosure will not stop here. The SEC rule will deny stockholders other important information. Fewer executives will be required to disclose their salaries. detailed reporting of contingent benefits like Incenltive pay plans will be eliminated. and reporting of stock options will be sharply curtailed. Mr. President. I am not the only one vho considers these changes Illadvised. The Commissions own division of enforcement sharply criticized the SECs proposal. I quote from a September 23. 1983. memo written- by Theodore A. Levine. Associate Director of the Commissions Division of Enforcement: ..We are concerned that certain of the proposed amendments will reduce signif icantly the disclosurc of information concerning management remuneration. The current provisions of item 402 require the disclosure of information that is useful to analysts in evaluating the efficiencies with which public companies operate. In recent hearings held by the Commission. witnesses suggested that increased disclosure rather than a reduction would enhance their ability to analyze publiclyheld companies. Also. there has not been sufficient demonstration that the amendments to the disclosure provisions will result in savings to the regis.trants that will be sufficient to Justify the reduction In the disclosure of important information to shareholders and analysts. The enforcement memo goes on to say The reduction Ii the disclosure requirements concerning management remuneration may -..lso result in a lessening of nccountabilihy by publiclyhield companies. Although accountability may not be a primary purpose of disclosure. it is anl important result. accordingly. we believe that the Conmmission should consider this factor in reaching a determination on thle ap~propriate level of disclosure of management remuneration. Moreover. we believe that certain amendments reduce the disclosure requirements concerning management remuneration without significantly simplifying disclosure requirements. reducing compliance burdens or providing added flexibility. Thus. the amendments. will deny to shareholders Important information. and make it more difficult to evaluate public companies without any corresponding benefit to registrants. That. Mr. President. Is from the SECs own Division of Enforcement. Consider the following newspaper headlines wvhich appeared after the SEC voted out this new rule change: From the Washington Post: SEC dereguilation gives top brass a license to steal: New SEC ruling creates free fire zone. And from the Wall Street Journal: SEC rules allow concerns to curb pay disclosure: companies likely to div~ulge less on executive fees. incentives. stock options. Mr. President. the diversity and complexity of executive compensation packages prompted the SEC. in 1978. to attempt to quantify the varied forms of management remuneration. Nowv. the Commission wants to reverse all of that. In advocating the new rule. the Commission argues that the 1978 system wvas too costly and the information provided too confusing for investors. Nonsense. Of the 115 comments received on this rule. only 15 came from individual shareholders. Eleven of these were critical of the SEC rule. I do not think the SEC eompiled a balanced record on this issue. Look at where the remaining bulk of comments came from70 corporations. 6 banks. 5 representatives of the securities industry. 8 law firms. and 7 trade associations. The SEC is going in thle wrong direction. The responsibility of the SEC is to mediate between regtllatees and the public. It is bound to consider the public benefits as well as the private costs of any regulation. The benefits to the public and stockholders. who have every right to oversee thle use of their resources. make those costs associated with reporting executive compensation unavoidable. There are ways to improve the system. But let us not revert to an outmoded and vague remuneration reporting system. If we do. we will be setting the stage for the scandals which can occur when corporate fringe benefits are hidden from stockholders. The SEC rule. as currently written. is a disservice to both investors and executives. I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment to prevent implementation of this rule and to allow time for the Congress and all interested parties to address this issue in the detail it deserves.
980191229,"Mr. President. when Ansel Adams died Sunday. April 29. at age 82. the Nation lost a great photographer and environmentalist. And many of us lost a great personal friend. Ansel was. of course. best known for his heroic photographs of the rich landscape of the American West. For many. his work defined landscape photography. He did not just ""take pictures."" He made photographs that stand with art at the highest level. There was no accident in his art. He would rise early to set up his tripod and view camera in remote areas. meter the light and waitwait until the light shifted. the clouds moved. the Moon appeared. He waited until just the instant when every element was perfect and the scene was revealed. never again to be recaptured except through those marvelous photographs. Nor did his art stop there. In the darkroom. Ansel controlled the negative and print at every point. He took the vision he has seen outside and created it on paper. turning silver and paper into a vision that others not only can see but also can feel. Just as he felt the scene when the picture was taken. That is what made Ansels pictures significantthey are not just seen. they are felt. They have purpose. They have impact. Few can see an original exhibition of Adams work without walking away in admiration of the sheer beauty and emotionalism of his photographs. Unlike so.many artists. Ansel did not shy away from using those photographs for political purposes. Ansel had a missionto protect and preserve that beautiful wilderness environment for future generations. He was unrelenting in his drive to preserve those Western landsYosemite. Point Lobos. Kings Canyon. and others. His pictures of Kings Canyon are credited with Lringing about the creation of that Great National Park. When confronted with the beauty carried to them. lawmakers were simply unable to refute his case. And millions of acres of land were preserved because he worked to save them. The recent tenure of James Watt as Secretary of the Interior deeply disturbed Ansel. He believed that James Watt threatened to destroy wilderness areas throughout the country which. once destroyed. could never be recovered. But James Watt also threatened the national concensus to maintain and preserve our wilderness heritage. which Ansel and others had worked all of their lives to create. He was heartened by Mr. Watts resignation. But I know he remained deeply concerned about the Reagan administrations commitment to protecting our wilderness areas. We will miss Ansels political activism. But most of all we will miss his enthusiasm and verve for living. He was an example to all of us. because he allowed people to become his friend. not just an acquaintance. He generated a feeling of closeness that binds many people together through him. We will have Ansels beautiful photographs. But now when we admire them. we will also feel a slight tug when we remember that the man who created these masterpiecesour friend Ansel Adamsis no longer with Its."
980244959,Mr. President. this amendment represents the end of a 3year controversy over who should pay the cost of repairing unsafe Federal dams in the West. While it falls considerably short of what I would like. it nonetheless is a giant step toward a more sound national water resource policy. The bill would authorize $650 million in repairs at more than 30 dams in the West. I have contended that local users should share the costs of the repairs. While the dams were *built and are owned by the United States. their safety defects are not the result of poor design or poor workmanship. Rather. new stateoftheart design criteria or new hydrologic and seismic data have cast into doubt the safety of the dams. Over the years. an unassailable principle of Federal water law has been that. where there are local benefits. local beneficiaries should help pay. It seems equally unassailable to me that. where a repair is necessary to continue a benefit. local users should be willing to pay. Until today. local users were unwilling to contribute to the cost of making the dams safe. They sincerely felt that. since the Federal Government built the dams. the Federal Government should pay to fix them. Ever since this bill emerged from the Energy Committee a year ago. these two positions have seemed irreconcilable. But the recognition on all sides that the bill must pass led to negotiations which have yielded a compromise we can all accept. I support this amendment largely because. It establishes two landmarks for national water policy legislation. Cost sharing has always been part of water project development. but dam safety has stood almost alone as the only water resource function iot subJect to cottsharing. With this amendment. we bring dam safety into the costsharing corral. In doing so. I believe. we establish the principle that virtually no Federal water investment shall be immune from cost sharing. For if we can apply cost sharing to dam safety repairs. arguably the most critical of all water resource functions. then we should apply cost sharing to virtually any water resource investment. As far as Im concerned. this bill establishes a base from which all future cost sharing debates should begin. This bill also provides that costs allocated to municipal and industrial water customers and costs allocated to recreation. fish and wildlife. and commercial power be repaid with interest fixed at market rates. For decades. Congress has subsidized western water development through below market interest rates governing repayment of Federal water investments. For example. the interest applied to all units of the central Arizona project. regardless of when construction begins. is 3.2 percent. Thus. a unit built in 1984 or 1990 will carry the same rates as a unit started in 1970. Taxpayers throughout the country have paid a heavy price for this unwarranted subsidy. With this bill. for the first time we have set terms requiring repayment with interest based on market rates. I believe this represents the end of the policy where taxpayers in Ohio. Florida. and elsewhere subsidize western water development through below market financing. Under the amendment. the Federal Government would pick up 85 percent of the dam safety repair costs while local beneficiaries would pay the remaining 15 percent. Repayment by farmers would be treated on an interestfree. abilitytopay basis. as has been the case for more than fifty years. Municipal and industrial water users and others would repay their entire share over 50 years. with interest computed on the average market yield of long term Treasury obligations. As I said. this amendment does not go nearly as. far as I should like. but too much is at stake to hold the bill up indefinitely. Too much farmland and too many communities are endangered. Indeed. too many lives are threatened. As difficult as it has been for me to compromise. I recognize that supporters have had an equally difficult time. This is a breadandbutter issue to them. it hits their constituents squarely in the pocketbooks. That is why I want to particularly commend the work of Senator DECONCINI. who spearheaded the drive to reach this compromise. and Representative UDALL and Governor Babbit of Arizona who nurtured it. Each of them. in his own way. did much to make it possible for this compromise to be arrived at. They did so at great political risk and demonstrated considerable courage and leadership. I also commend Senator McCLURE for his role in this compromise. I know he feels strongly that local users should not pay a share of these costs and I am sure he swallowed long and hard before getting on board. In the end. all of us have put the overriding national need for this bill ahead of our own political agendas.
980269992,Mr. President.. it is not often that I get a chance to stand up and support the administration and support the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from New Hampshire. I want to put this issue in proper perspective. It is easy to talk about egregious cases and about that terrible Federal Government. and the FTC. We are part of the Federal Government. and yet we always seem to enjoy running against that Federal Government. The fact is that on this particular issue there probably have been more hours spent negotiating a solution of the municipalities problem than almost any other issue of similar bearing. Senator THURMOND has spent much time on it. Senator RUDMAN has. I have. hundreds of lobbyists have. and we have come up with a solution that will help the cities. It will make them liable only for an injunction against them and will eliminate the damage actions. That is a solution that was agreed upon and is tremen- f dously important to the cities. r Part of that understanding was that the repealer with respect to the FTC jurisdiction would also be adopted. When the distinguished junior Sena- f tor from South Carolina learned about this negotiated agreement we had made for the cities. he saw fit to adopt it. minus the FTC repealer. as his own. But it is Senator THURMONDs amend- ment and Senator RUDMANs amendment and it is my amendment. and it is a way of solving the problems of the cities. You may be successful in keeping the FTC repeal of jurisdiction in if we defeat Senator RUDMANs amendment. But if you do that. you then have to face the whole issue of whether or not the protection for the cities will or will not become operable. whether we will keep that in the bill. whether it will not be amended in different ways. whether or not it is subject to a point of order. and whether Representative RODINO will accept it. We hope a simple solution. If the amendment of Senator RODMAN is passed. the cities are going to have full protection against suits brought against them for damages. If Senator HOLLINGS is successful in defeating Senator RUDMANS amendment. then this debate will continue for some time in connection with the second phase. I strongly urge upon my colleagues that they recognize the fact that most of us have attempted to do that which is right for the cities of this country and give them protection against antitrust suits involving millions. and in some cases hundreds of millions. of dollars. If we adopt the Rudman amendment. there will be no further problem for the cities in that respect. If we do not adopt the Rudman amendment. then all the protection that would otherwise be accorded the cities is in real jeopardy. I strongly urge that we get about our business. and adopt the Rudman amendment. The FTC Jurisdiction that Senator HOLLINGS talks about is certainly not a major matter. It is a matter of principle to many of us. but it is not a major matter or a threat to the cities of.this country. I think that if we are going to protect the cities. we should adopt the Rudman amendment. as supported by the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina and me. and then we will have adequate protection for the cities. Without that. I am not sure that we will. Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.
980275914,"Mr. President. it is ironic that the sponsors of this bill named it the ""Rural Electrification and Telephone Revolving Fund SelfSufficiency Act of 1984."" This is selfsufficiency? Since when is forgiving a debt of $7.9 billion owed to the Treasury considered ""selfsufficiency?"" Since when is it ""selfsufficient"" to continue to roll over other outstanding debt. rather than establish. a system of regular payments so the notes are paid on time? According to CBO. this bill will cost at least $11 billion. I have discussed this bill with the cooperative members of my own State. And I told them that I do not believe most of their own cooperative members world agree with the giveaway provisions of this bill. I believe most farm families believe in paying their debts. They dont want Government handouts. And they know that this program is spending more than it is taking in. which can only lead to trouble down the road. There are many objectionable provisions in this legislation. Certainly the worst provision is the section that simply eliminates the requirement that the REA revolving fund repay $7.9 billion to the Treasury starting in That revolving fund was establisled in 1973 to operate on a selfsustaining basis. Congress set up the fund by transferring the outstanding indebtedness owed by previous REA borrowers on loans from 1953 through 1973 as seed capital. That amounted to a $7.9 billion loan given interestfree to the fund for 20 years. The fund was supposed to be adequate to meet Its obligations and to provide loans to electric and telephone borrowers. But even with that tremendous advantage. the revolving fund is now faced with a dwindling cash flow. By 1989. it is estimated that the fund will be running in the red. How did this happen? How did the fund get into such trouble? The simple answer is that the fund just kept spending much more than it was taking In. Unfortunately. this socalled selfsufficiency legislation does nothing to address this underlying problem. When it was first set up. Congress mandated that the fund loan money to coops at a fixed rate of 5 percent and a hardship rate of 2 percent. At that time. the rate of Government money was 5.009. Obviously. the rate of money issued to coops was supposed to be comparable to the rate of money borrowed by Treasury. Inflation soon caused Treasury rates to rise higher and higher. but the revolving fund still loaned 5percent money. It still is loaning money at 5 percent and 2 percent. even though Treasury notes are now about 11 percent. Even this discrepancy would probably allow the fund to remain selfsufficient if the fund had borrowed a moderate volume of money. Instead. Congress actually mandated that the fund issue $1.1 billion of loans each year-$1.1 billion was to be issued regardless of the true level of demand by coops for new construction. regardless of the merit of those projects. regardless of the financial capabilities of the coops to borrow private funds. Faced with the mandate to loan out $1.1 billion at 5percent interest. the revolving fund has been forced since 1976 to borrow against its assets to develop additional capital. In other words. to continue a program of $1.1 billion. the fund is borrowing money in todays market at 11 percent. and loaning that money out at 5 percent. So far. the fund has borrowed $3.5 billion in certificates of beneficial ownership at an average rate of about 10 percent. The interest payments alone on those notes is now costing the fund about $300.000 each year. S. 1300 also fails to amortize those notes. which will come due as balloon payments after 2006. Instead. it simply rolls over those notes when they come due. rather than paying them off. Is it any wonder why this revolving fund is going broke? The obvious response should be to lower the level of program loans. so that it is not necessary for the fund to go deeper and deeper into debt. It also makes sense to increase the interest rate of any new loansup to an estimated level of about 9 percentso that all the obligations can be paid on schedule. That is right. According to CBO. it is possible to attain the goal of true selfsufficiency by raising interest rates to about 9 percentstill far below market rates and below the Treasury rate as well. And it would cost electric consumers less than a penny a day to do so. But does S. 1300 try this approach? It does not. Unfortunately. Mr. President. this attempt to run away from the debt owed to Treasury is just the tip of the iceberg with the REA loan *program. The more one investigates. the more one is shocked to. learn how much money is going to cooperatives who have little need for such a generous Federal handout. The fact is that the mission of the Rural Electrification Administration has changed over the past 50 years. Back in 1935 when it was first established. only 12 percent of the farms in the country had electricity. But today. virtually all parts of the country are electrified. Despite this reality. Con.gress has mandated that we continue to provide $1.1 billion of new loans each year at 5 percent. even though the cooperatives do not really need that much money. How can we know that? First. we know there is less demand for that money because REA is having difficulty fulfilling its mandated loan level this year. There simply are not enough applications for loans coming into REA. even for that 5percent money. Second. there is an estimated $2.2 billion of loans that have been approved by REA. but which have not been drawn down. That $2.2 billionin 5 percent and 2 percent loansrepresents 2 full years worth of program which has not been utilized. And some of those loans have been approved but not drawn down for several years. Yet. Congress insists on mandating a high loan programand refuses to take the action to winnow down the program so this kind of outrageous bailout legislation would not be necessary. In addition. the GAO has pointed out that many of the loans are going to cooperatives who are in excellent fianncial shapemuch better than nieghboring utilities. In a survey conducted in 1978. GAO reviewed 922 electric cooperatives. Fortytwo percent of the total386were judged to be financially sound enough to obtain credit from the private market at reasonable rates. Still. they were obtaining 5 percent loans from the revolving fund. S. 1300 fails to address this inequity by requiring a means test. And it even goes further by actually requiring that any loan issued by the fund to a cooperative provide 70 percent of the funds. with only 30 percent coming from private funds. How can this arbitrary 7030 ratio be good policy? Why isnt there an effort to target the money to those projects that truly need the assistance? Personally. Mr. President. I do not believe we should be providing 5percent money for this program. Even the higher interest rate included in this bill. S. 1300. would be only 6.5 percent which just covers the interest cost of CBO borrowing. That interest rate would not cover the principal on the CBOs. nor does it pay off that $7.9 billion loan to Treasury. However. as I stated earlier. a 9percent loan rate for all new loans would cover all those expenses. And if an effort was made to reduce the program level. and especially to target those funds. it would be possible to make the fund solvent without a great amount of CBO borrowing in the future. We need to instill some discipline into this program. I have always been a strong supporter of the REA progiam. No one I know is against a strong rural electricification and telephone cooperative effort. But this program cannot continue to spend beyond its means. I believe S. 1300 sends the wrong message to the REA cooperatives. It is time to help improve this program. It is time to provide subsidized loans only to coops that really need that Federal assistance. Instead. S. 1300 continues the old ways that have overspent the program funds already. For all these reasons. I must oppose S. 130C as it was reported by the Agriculture Committee. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD an article on this subject which was published in the Readers Digest of September 1984. 1"

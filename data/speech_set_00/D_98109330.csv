980015501,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 13 calling for a mutual and verifiable freeze between the Soviet Union and the United States in the deployment. testing. and production of nuclear weapons. When the House last debated this issue on August 5. 1982. I was not a Member of Congress. The freeze that day lost by a single vote. If one Member of Congress had voted for the nuclear freeze instead of against it. the House would have passed a nuclear freeze resolution. Had I been here last August 5. I would have voted for this resolution. What last years vote demonstrated. is how important one vote is not only to the passage of a single bill. but in this case. the passage of a resolution that could mean the continued survival of civilization. as we know it. The nuclear freeze is the basis from which we can begin the reduction of our nuclear weapons arsenals and bring the escalating arms race to a halt. The nuclear freeze is supported by a strong grassroots constituency. Nine States. 340 cities and counties. and 400 New England town meetings have adopted freeze resolutions. Nearly 12 million Americans voted for the freeze last November. and a January 1983 Harris poll found 76 percent of the public in favor of a U.S.-U.S.S.R. negotiated agreement. Mr. Chairman. I know firsthand what the people of my district in Bucks and eastern Montgomery Counties feel about this issue. As I cam. paigned throughout the Eighth Congressional District. there were two Issues that were of the highest urgencypeace and jobs. The people in southeastern Pennsylvania are no different than people all over the United States. In my district. I heard the call for peace. for a nuclear freeze. from women and men. from Republicans. Democrats and Independents. from all income levels. and from the children. too. Many of these same people voted for me because of one issue. the nuclear freeze. today Mr. Speaker I vote for them. Although the urgings of my constituents are of prime importance to me. I could not and would not support this resolution if I thought it would freeze the United States at an inferior level to the Soviet Union. or if I thought it would jeopardize the national security of the United States. One important basis for the nuclear freeze is that there is parity now between the Soviet Union and the United- States in nuclear capabilities. This fact has been spoken to by U.S. military experts. Gen. John Vessey. Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger have both testified that they would not trade the nuclear capabilities of the United States for that of the Soviet Union. This underscores the belief that our nuclear capability is every bit as strong as the Soviet Union. I am. of course. aware that the nuclear forces of the Soviet Union and the United States are not identical. The nuclear freeze resolution recognizes assymetries exist in the nuclear balance with each side holding some advantages over the other. For example. the Soviets lead in launchers2.500 to 2.000. we lead in warheads9.500 to 7.000. While the Soviets lead us in ballistic missile submarines62 to 32we lead them in total number of nuclear warheads deployed at sea at all times3.000 to 300. Threefourths of the Soviet strategic nuclear arsenal is concentrated in vulnerable landbased missile silos. but about onehalf of our nuclear arsenal Is based in invulnerable submarines. The bottom line is that this is the proper time to negotiate a freeze. because both forces are essentially equivalent. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I joined 26 of my Republican and Democratic colleagues to pass this bill out of committee. Prior to passage of House Joint Resolution 13. I successfully offered an amendment in the committee. This amendment strengthened the nuclear freeze resolution by declaring it to be ""consistent with the maintenance of essential equivalence in overall nuclear capabilities."" This -language reaffirms that the nuclear capabilities of the two superpowers are equivalent. This was not explicitly stated previously and is in contrast to this administrations belief that we must deploy several new weapons. including the MX and Trident II missiles. to attain parity with the Soviets. The time to freeze is now. not after further rounds of weapons deployment. There are several specific issues that I would like to address. First. there is continued concern that a nuclear freeze would be difficult to verify. Of course. intelligence experts have testified that weapons treaties are verifiable and that the United States has always been able to verify any new deployment of weapons by the Soviets. I believe the freeze resolution addresses this problem. The point of the freeze is that we must negotiate the details of an arms control agreement. Not only will we negotiate the numbers and types of weapon allowed. but we will also negotiate the manner in which we can verify these levels of weapons. Verification procedures must be worked out or there will be no agreement. More importantly. a freeze would greatly assist verification. Any new testing. production. or deploymentany arms development activitywould be a violation of the treaty. On the other hand. escalation of the arms race is allowed then it will be extremely difficult to keep track of Soviet military activity. Finally. Mr. Chairman this resolu tion of the Congress does not call for unilateral disarmament. I am opposed to this and so are. I believe. my colleagues who voted for this freeze resolution last year and again today. Let us not belabor this point. The phrase ""mutual and verifiable"" is emphasized over and over throughout House Joint Resolution 13. Last. I urge my colleagues to reject the Broomfield or administration resolution. This amendment calls for a policy of further arms production and then freeze. This ""build nowreduce later"" approach would allow both sides to build destabilizing firststrike weapons. in addition to concealable and unverifiable cruise missiles. An escalated arms race will be tragically expensive. President Reagan has already proposed a $1.6 trillion defense buildup over the next 5 years and a fiscal year 1984 budget of $239 billion. Not only is an escalated nuclear weapons race not necessary. but it would be very damaging to our already crippled domestic economy. I urge my colleagues to support House Joint Resolution 13 because the American people want it and because rarely has the Congress had an opportunity to choose a direction so clearly in the national and international interest."
980068368,Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 10. the National Development Investment Act. This bill authorizes $500 million in each of the next 3 years for economic development programs. Since existing authority for the Economic Development Administration (EDA) has been allowed to expire under the Reagan administration. this legislation Is urgently needed to carry forward economic development in communities with below average per capita income. with high unemployment. or with a sudden rise in unemployment due to plant closings or other major economic dislocation. I.R. 10 authorizes 50 percent matching grants to eligible communities for the repair. refurbishing or development of roads and bridges. other transportation facilities such as airports and ports. sewer systems. city water systemsthe socalled infrastructure which keeps our economy and our country going. Weve read a great deal lately about the decaying infrastructure in our country. and about how vital it is to local. State. and regional economic development efforts. This bill is aimed at that very great need. In Pennsylvania. I can assure my colleagues. Mr. Speaker. we need the jobs and our roadsand bridges need to be repaired. This bill will target funds for this work to areas of unemployment such as Bucks and eastern Montgomery counties. The building and construction trades strongly support this legislation because of its job creating potential. and I do too for this reason. I also support the employee stock ownership provision in H.R. 10. The bill allows the 50 percent matching grants to be used for both technical assistance and capital funds to promote employee stock ownership. particularly for those plants or businesses which would otherwise shut down. Employee ownership can provide a meaningful option for employees faced with a plant closing. and I am pleased that EDA will have the specific authority to become involved in these situations. I commend the chairman of the Public Works Committee. Mr. HOWARD of New Jersey. for bringing this legislation forward. The Reagan adininistration is ignoring the need for jobs in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Mr. Speaker. and I hope this legislation can expeditiously move forward to bring development jobs.and economic growth to our communities.
980068769,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 1. the Housing and UrbanRural Recovery Act of I wish. Mr. Chairman. to direct my remarks to those sections of the bill dealing with section 8 elderly housing. The legislation we have before us today will rectify a terrible injustice which was inflicted upon all those residing in senior citizen housing communities by the GrammLatta budget bill approved by the Congress in 1981. In the Eighth Congressional District in Pennsylvania. this legislation will apply to the following senior communities under the Bucks County Housing Authority: Grundy Towers in Bristol Borough: Grundy Manor in Telford. Grundy Home in Quakertown: Grundy Hall Doylestown. Mirian Wood Brown in Perkasie. Galilhe Village in Levittown. and The new Grundy Gardens in Fairless Ifills. In 19111 Congress slashed the aut horized funding for senior housing prograins. and increased the tenant contribution toward rnt from 25 to 30 prcent of tenant income. and required the Department of Housing and Urban Development to severely limit income deductions for extraordinary medical expenses. These changes were all too typical of tihe callous approach of the Reagan administration in cutting programs to aid the truly needy. These ruts hit seniorsthose generally on a fixed income who have a limited ability to absorb hefty increases in their housing costs. and the cuts bear no relation to the situation facing senior citizens regarding their medical costs. HUD has now proposed a regulation which would eliminate all itemized medical expenses and substitute a standard medical deduction of $300 in order to carry out the GrammLatta bill. This is truly outrageous. I would like. Mr. Chairman. to share soni statistics with my colleagues to prove my point. Mr. Andrew Flager. the management agent at Galilee Village in Levittown. Pa.. has provided me. on an anonymots basis. the annual medical deductions for 12 of his tenants. taken at random. Six tenants surveyed. all individuals. had the following medical costs: $1.081. $841 $1.146 $719. and $1.348. for an average of $963.67. Six couples had the following costs: $1.656. $1.424. $2.681. $2.293. $1.445. and $1.295. for ati average of $1.865.67 per couple. It is obvious that a $300 flat deduction is totally inadequate in computiing realistic rents for our senior citizen tenants. The bill before us. H.R. 1. does two things of benefit to these tenants in assisted housing: First. it restores the amount of income that tenants are required to contribute toward rent from the current level of 30 to 25 percent of income as it was prior to 1981. Second. the bill establishes legislatively tle exclusions to income that would be determined before applying tile 25 perctnit contribution level. The exclusions especially applicable to seniors would be: First. $400 personal exclusion ($800 for a couple): Second. $400 for each disabled handicapped person. and. addressing the need evidenced above. and third. extraordinary medical expenses exceeding 3 percent of income. Mr. Chairman. I am pleased the House is coming to terms with the special housing needs of our elderly. This would be a top priority for the Congress. and I hope the Senate moves expedit iously in passing this bill and sending it to the President. so that the obvious inequities in his earlier budget proposal can be rectified.o
980080967,"Mr. Chairman. I would like to make just four brief points. I think that in the discussion of symmetry we are in danger of losing the central focus of the debate. which is whether this aid ought to be covert or overt. The gentleman from Illinois pointed to the photographs which are here in the Chamber and said that the interdiction of weapons coming into El Salvador Is a success. We are in favor of interdicting those weapons. We are in favor of spending $80 million to friendly countries to help them interdict those weapons. So that is not the issue here today. There is not one side which is in favor of stopping the flow of weapons into El Salvador and another side which is disagreeing with that. So that is not the issue here. We are talking about whether or not the aid should be covert or overt. Second. what we do by this amendment. I think. is to make American foreign policy contingent on third parties. on the leaders of Central America. We are putting Nicaragua in the drivers seat. What if people come to power in Nicaragua who are even worse than the people who are there now? And I have no sympathy with the Sandinista government. What if they deliberately do not want the settlement to occur? Is it not possible that the leaders of Nicaragua and other countries could deliberately see that this process does not work? I do not think we should hold American foreign policy hostage to the leaders of Nicaragua. During the discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. on which I serve. we talked about making aid to the Government of El Salvador contingent on requiring that Government to negotiate with the guerrillas. And the gentleman from Illinois said at the time. and I think quite correctly. ""We cant do that. What if the guerrillas refuse to negotiate? Then we will end up cutting off aid to the Government of El Salvador which wants to negotiate because the guerrillas dont want to negotiate."" That is what we are doing here. What if the Nicaraguans and others in Central America do not want this to work? Again we are making American foreign policy contingent not on what we want but on what they want. and I think that is a mistake. Third. if this amendment is adopted. we are giving to the Reagan administration a blank check to do virtually anything they want to do in Central America. Fourth. the President has the power now to stop our military activity there if they stop theirs. We do not need to pass this amendment to give the President the power to do that. He can do that anyway. The President now enjoys the option to do precisely what this amendment allows him to do. We do not need to pass a bill or an amendinent to do that. The purpose of this amendment is not to stop the flow of arms into El Salvador. The purpose of this amendment is not to stop American involvement in Central America. The purpose of this amendment is to provide an excuse to continue covert aid in Central America. and that is the issuecovert or overt."
980093086,Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3391. We have been waiting for the economy to move forward. but the unemployment rate in my district is still very hightoo high. Imports are part of the prob1em. and are causing the loss of hundreds of jobs In the EighthT Congressional District. One of United States Steels largest facilities. the Fairless Works. is located in Bucks County. We arc ail to familiar with the layoffs at this plaqnt andl the potential for future layoffs is quite possible. The steel Industry is being devastated by imports. H.R. 3391 will help soften the difficulties facing the steel industry. The trade adjustment assistance programs were enacted 20 years ago. and renewed in 1974 and 1981. to provide cash benefits. training. and Job search and relocation assistance to workers. and technical and financial assistance to firms. when Increased imports contribute importantly to layoffs and to sales or production declines. In 1981. Congress passed the administration backed GrammiLatta budget bill which called for the termination of thle trade adjustment assistance program on September 30. 1983. We must act today to restore this program. I have thousands of unemployed steelworkers that need retraining and deserve retraining. A letter I received from the United Steelworkers of America explained the difficult situation facing the industry: Despite the serious depression that has plagued the domestic steel industry over the past 2 years. Imports of steel products as a percentage of domestic consumption have reached record levels and pernicious unemployment continues unabated. The situtation for U.S. industries Is very serious. Today. more than 70 percent of all goods produced in the United States must compete with foreignmade products. Unemployment has not fallen below 9 percent since February 1982 and more specifically. unemployment rates in U.S. steel and automobile industries have been between 30 and 40 percent for the same period. The sad truth is that many of these workers will not be rehired after the economy improves. H.R. 3391 is much improved over previous trade adjustment bills. First this bill reauthorized the Worker and Firm Trade Adjustment Assistance Act at $111 million in fiscal year 1984 and $56 million In fiscal year 1985. But it also corrects some inequities in the current benefit structure. Workers In independent firms that produce essential component parts to an industry that has been adversely affected by importssuch as iron ore for steel millsmay for the first time. be eligible for the trade readjustment assistance (TRA). Also. workers who are laid off from firms which relocate their production operations- overseas may be certified for TRA benefits. Currently. these workers may be eligible only If the foreign production is imported back into the domestic market. Under H.R. 3391. job search and relocation allowances paid to workers whose local job opportunities have dried up would be increased as well. Technical assistance. under this bill. could now be provided for industries which have undergone a substantial adverse effect from imports. Furthermore. technical assistance. loans and loan guarantees would be authorized for firm readjustment assistance. H.R. 3391 would provide the assistance and opportunity for unemployed workers in my district and all over the country to learn another skill and find a new. meaningful Job. This is a program that does something about the unemployment rate. this is a program that gives workers another chance to make a living. this Is a program which responds to the import problem and this Is a program that Is necessary and I urge the House to adopt H.R. 3391.o
980103283,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. the only good thing about this bill is its sponsor. my good friend from Florida . I would not want the occasion to pass. also. without recognizing Mr. FAsCELLs colleague from Florida (Mr. SMITHI& While I disagree with the viewpoTnt taken by these gentleman. I must commend Mr. SMITH In. his first term for his very hard work on behalf of this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker. this bill could be a good deal worse. In fact. it was. When it left our committee. this bill deserved an IF."" It is a little bit improved now. but not much. It is up. to a ""D minus"" at best. And that is only because very significant changes were made in the Senate. Most of those changes. I am happy to say. were based on an amendment which I had offered In the full committee. What the-.committee failed to do when we had jurisdiction. the other body has managed. to do. I am happy to say. But the fact. Mr.. Speaker. Is. that this bill Is still a- dog. But it is not. quite as mangy as it was when it last left us. Let me say to.-the House. that as an opponent. of the- original bill in the Foreign Affairs Committee and author oft the so.-called VOA. option. I can only note withL Some-. awe. the. dedication. that the chairman of the International Operations. Subcommittee demonstrated in:. working to expand broadcasting. to. Cuba:. As the. gentleman. from Florida. noted.. S.. 602 Is- a compromise- bill. with significant changes from. the bill reported by the. Foreign. Affairs Committee.. That legislationj Mr. Speaker. I believe would have been a major mistake for those technical broadcasting reasons noted by the National Association of Broadcasters in their testimony before the House and Senate. But more Importantly. the Radio Marti -legislation would. have been bad. foreign policy. ~What was so bad about the original Radio Marti concept?- Really nothing in. the abstract- in fact. the Governmentfinanced. Voice. of America (VOA) broadcasts 5 / hours of programing a day that is directed at Cuba. and heard all over Cuba. from its facility at Marathon Island. Fla. It was less the substance than the style of the Radio Marti proposal that was potentially so damaging to our relations with Cuba. which are. badly in need of repair. For almost a quarter of a century. CubanUnited States relations have gone almost steadily downhill. beginning with a total economic embargo. to an Americanbacked invasion of the island.. to the ridiculous assassination attempt on Fidel Castro concocted by the CIA. The administrations original Radio Marti proposal was Intended only to widennot bridgethe gap that already divides- the two countries. The United States and Cuba have demonstrated the capacity to deal with each. other where it serves our mutual purposes. Over the last 10 years we have negotiated agreements with the Cubans on maritime boundaries. fishing rights. aircraft hijackings. and on the establishment of the interest sections that operate out of the Swiss and Czech Embassies in Havana and Washington. respectively. There are many other areas where agreements would be useful. such as on the return. to Cuba of convicts who emigrated during the Mariel boatlift and on eliminating commercial radio Interference between Cuban and United States stations. Radio Marti would have done nothing to encourage the Cubans to cooperate. In fact at the 1981 Rio de Janeiro conference to settle commercial radio issues the Cubans walked out in reaction. to the Radio Marti proposal. I am hopeful that passage of S. 602 will not jeopardize the possibility. of bettering relations with Cuba in the future. but Mr. Speaker. I have my doubts. The VOA does a fine job of providing news and informationobjective newvs and informationto the island of Cuba. to supplement the Cubans. access to regular commercial Soptember 29..1983 H. 7686 broadcasts from the mainland United States. While I think this compromise proposal giving ultimate Jurisdiction over expanded broadcasting to Cuba to the VOA to Insure Its integrity and objectivity is far superior to the original measure. I am still unconvinced of the wisdom of this venture in the first place. The needs of the Caribbean Basin. and the need for positive foreign policy accomplishments to try to bring solutions to the myriad economic. social and political problems of Latin America cry out for more prudent and more promising Initiatives than this."
980141908,"Mr. Speaker. I take this time tonight to announce the names of all 101 of my colleagues who have cosponsored House Concurrent Resolution 170. introduced by my colleagues JOE GAYDOS. JOHN MURTHA. and myself. in opposition to the proposed United States SteelBritish Steel joint venture involving the Importation of subsidized foreign steel. As you know. Mr. Speaker. United States Steel and British Steel have been negotiating the annual Importation of 3 million tons of steel into the American market. This would result in the cessation of steelmaking at the Fairless Works In Pennsylvania and the direct loss of an estimated 3.000 jobs In my congressional district. We are opposed to this deal for the following reasons: First. unfair competition. The steel to be imported is clearly subsidized by the British Government. In recent countervailing duty suits. U.S. trade officials have found subsidy margins of up to 20 percent on Britishmade steel. Our domestic steel Industry will have yet another source of unfair competition to contend with. Second. contravention of the existIng United StatesEuropean Commnunity steel arrangement. One year ago the United States negotiated with European steel exporters an arrangement limiting steel exports to the United States for a variety of products. The arrangement covers some 3 million tons annually. Should the United States SteelBritish Steel plan be consummated. allowing another 3 million H 10418 CO tons to enter the United States. the underlying U.S.-E.C. arrangement will surely collapse. Third. breach of faith. Last winter steelworkers across the country ratifled a contract which gave back many previously bargainedfor benefits. As part of the negotiations. domestic producers agreed to plough back wage and benefit savings into plant modernIzation. The United States Steel plan to now replace domestic capacity with a foreign source of raw steel clearly violates this understanding. Fourth. future of the steel industry. Foreign competition. much of it involving ""dumped"" steel. now accounts for 20 percent of domestic steel comsuruption. If this deal goes through. It will force other U.S. producers at other plants across the country to undertake similar arrangements with foreign suppliers who have the capability of exporting huge quantities of raw steel to our country. The very future of our steel industry is at stake here. If the deal is consummated. United States Steels domestic competitors and organized labor have promised to fight this battle in the courts. In addition. Lionel Olmer. Under Secretary for International Trade at the Departmrnit of Commerce. testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee last month that the repercussions would be so disastrous. the Government may be ""compelled to selffiitiate an unfair trade case."" Mr. Speaker. the text of House Concurrent Resolution 170 is as follows. with a list of cosponsors: H. CoN. REs. 170 Whereas the proposed Joint venture between the United States Steel Corporation and the British Steel Corporation for the importation of semifinished steel slabs is not in the public Interest. Whereas the proposed joint venture would result in the loss of at least three thousand direct steelmaking Jobs and an additional five thousand four hundred jobs In the support of steelmaking in the Fairless. Pennsylvania. area. Whereas. if the proposed joint venture lesuit.. In an agreement and steel is Imported Into the United States. there may be possible violations of United States laws regarding unfair trade practices and a violation of the recently negotiated United Stales%-European Community steel arrangement under paragraph 10. which states that consultations will be held between the parties when a significant Increase in Imports indicates the possibility of diversion of trade from arrangement products to certain steel products other than arrangement products. and Whereas. if the proposed joint venture goes through. a new unfair competitive factor would be inJected into the domestic market. forcing other domestic steel companies to seek similar arrangements. thus reducing raw steelmaking capacity exacerbating unemployment and creating a threat to national security and the general economly: Now. therefore. be it Resolved by thme House of Representatives (the Senate concurningi.

980147995,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1961. the Agent Orange and Atomic Veterans Relief Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. Recognition of the medical needs of those veterans who served our country in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam era and who participated in the testing of nuclear devices between 1945 and 1903 is long overdue. I believe that we. as Members of Congress. must respond to the apprehension and concern among Vietnam veterans and their families about the possible longterm health effects that may have been caused by exposure to agent orange while servingin Southeast Asia. In addition. this bill addresses the health concerns of atomic veterans and their families who were exposed to lowlevel ionizing radiation. The herbicide agent orange was used extensively in Vietnam over a 10year period to reduce or eliminate jungle foliage. Agent orange contains dioxin. one of the most toxic substances known to science. At this time. we do not know all the longterm effects of dioxin on humans. nor do we know how much exposure can be expected to harm human health. However. agent orange has been linked to at least three types of disease: a form of cancer known as softtissue sarcoma. a liver condition known as porphyria cutanea tarda or PCT. and a skin condition known as chloracne. It is estimated that 220.000 military personnel may have been exposed to radiation effects between 1945 and 1963. Studies have shown that those persons involved in the nuclear testing have a higher than expected rate of leukemia and bone marrow disease known as polycythemia vera. This bill provides that retroactive to October 1. 1983. a temporary disability (or death) allowance would be payable to veterans who served in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam era and who later suffer from one of three conditionsaofttissue sarcoma. porphyria cutanea tarda. or chloracne. The softtissue sarcoma must be shown to exist within 20 years from date of departure from Southeast Asia while the other two conditions must be shown to exist within 1 year from date of departure. The bill also provides that retroactive to October 1. 1983. a temporary disability (or death) allowance would be payable to veterans who participated in the testing of nuclear devices or who participated in the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki immediately after World War II and. within 20 years from time of participation. suffer from cancer of the thyroid. leukemia. or polycytheinia vera. Under the bill. these benefits would be terminated 1 year after the Veterans Administration submits to Congress a study now being prepared by the Centers for Disease Control on the effect of agent orange exposure on veterans health. This study is expected to be completed between 1987 and 1989. Public Law 98160. which was signed into law on November 21. 1983. already requires the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to consider the feasibility of conducting an epidemiological study on the effects of lowlevel ionizing radiation on veterans who participated in the testing of nuclear devices or who were in the occupation forces at Hiroshima and Nagasaki immediately after World War II. It is estimated that this study. if undertaken. would be completed before the agent orange study. I am concerned. as are others. Mr. Speaker. about the fact that the benefits authorization in this bill terminates 1 year after the agent orange study is completed. Therefore. it will be important for the Veterans Affairs Committee and the Congress to carefully follow the progress of the studies to insure their objectivity and accuracy. and then to be prepared to pass the appropriate legislation expeditiously upon learning of the findings. This legislation is an important first step regarding compensation for exposure to agent orange and lowlevel radiation. However. this bill is not a cureall and questions relating to this compensation for veterans will continue after the bill is passed. I join several of my colleagues on the Veterans Affairs Committee in urging the creation of an independent advisory committee to objectively analyze all new and existing scientific evidence pertaining to dioxin exposure. I believe this would insure that viewpoints contrary to VA positions receive fair and expeditious consideration. In addition. I support an open. public procedure by which the VA can clarify how much and what kind of proof is still neces.1 sary before additional agent orange claims can be approved. Mr. Speaker. I know as a cosponsor of this bill that it has been carefully examined by veterans and veterans groups throughout our Nation. The bill is supported by such veteran organizations as the Vietnam Veterans of America. the American Legion. and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Many of the veterans I represent from Bucks County and eastern Montgomery County in Pennsylvania have impressed upon me the importance of this bill. Vietnam and atomic veterans loyal service to America was without question a display of courage. strength. and devotion. As elected representatives. we have an obligation to defend the interests of veterans who have already made great sacrifices in serving and protecting our country and I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1961.e v Mr. CORRADA. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1961. the Agent Orange and Atomic Veterans Relief Act which establishes a presumption of serviceconnection for certain diseases present in Vietnam veterans and veterans who participated in the detonation of an atomic bomb or device or in the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. that may be attributable to the exposure to agent orange or ionizing radiation. I believe that it is only fitting and just to compensate veterans who suffer certain diseases which have been reasonably linked to the veterans exposure to agent orange and atomic radiation during their time in military service. While these illnesses stand officially unrecognized due to the lack of conclusive scientific evidence of their serviceconnection. they are real. they are painful. they have been reasonably established as serviceincurred diseases and therefore. during the absence of scientific proof to the contrary. the ailing veteran should be compensated. The Federal Government has the responsibility to compensate our soldiers for all serviceconnected disabilities and whenever we are in doubt as to the serviceconnection of a disease. the benefit of the doubt should rest with the veteran. they have rightfully earned this deference. I urge my colleagues to vote for the passage of this legislation which places the responsibility for the health damaging results the use of herbicides and ionizing radiation yielded where it belongs.e
980179068,Mr. Chairman. I rise in reluctant support of H.R. 4170. the Tax Reform Act of 1984. Earlier today I opposed the rulemaking consideration of H.R. 4170 in order. I would have preferred an open rule which would have permitted amendments to the bill. As with any omnibus bill such as the one before us now. there are provisions which I find objectionable. The provisions of H.R. 4170 which most concern me are those dealing with industrial development bonds. I would have voted for an amendment either striking the IDB restrictions. or modifying them. IDBs have been tremendously important in Pennsylvania. and in my own congressional district in stimulating construction. and development. as well as rehabilitation and renovation of existing structures. IDBs have been useful in creating jobs. a major concern of mine. I believe the cap on IDBs contained in H.R. 4170 will impose unreasonable restrictions their use. The Senate bill is preferable in that it has no cap. and I am hopeful that the Senate conferees will prevail on this point. The cap does not distinguish between good and bad projects. If there are reforms to be made in the IDB area. it seems to me there are better ways to do it than a cap which will cause good projects as well as bad to be eliminated. It is for this reason that H.R. 4170 as presently before us is vigorously opposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I agree with my Governor. Dick Thornburgh and others on this issue. Now. however. that the rule prohibiting amendments has been passed in spite of these objections. I find that the bills many merits cause me to vote in favor of its adoption. First of all. I think the American people are rightly asking the President and the Congress to at long last take some action to reduce the projected budget deficits. I commend the Ways and Means Committee for taking the lead and coming up with a package which will cut the deficits by some $49 billion over a 4year period. Along with limiting increases in military spending. I believe the enactment of the tax reforms contained in this package are the quickest and surest way we can make some progress on the deficit issue. The President. I am pleased to say. supports passage of H.R. 4170 as well. citing this very reason. Last week we saw the prime rate increase from 11% to 12 percent. Most economists predict that rates will continue to climb because the looming deficits will put extreme pressure on the credit markets. We simply have to send a signal to the investment community that we are taking steps to reduce the deficit. Frankly. I wish we could do more. and that the administration would support such efforts. There are other features of this bill which are attractive. The realtors in my district support H.R. 4170 because of the extension of mortgage subsidy bonds contained therein. The insurance industry is . apporting the long overdue changes in tax treatment of life insurance companies. Others are enthusiastically supporting the provisions which for the first time codify tax treatment of many fringe benefits. The bill also contains provisions for which I was an original cosponsor reducing the increases in the truck user taxes scheduled to take effect on July 1. 1984. And the bill delays currently scheduled decreases in windfall profits taxes on income from decontrolled oil. So for all these reasons. I am supporting H.R. 4170. Mr. Chairman. At the same time I would hope that the House conferees on this measure. Mr. Chairman. would at the appropriate time recede to the Senate on key elements of the IDB provisions so that many worthwhile projects using IDB financing can go forward.
980192537,"Mr. Speaker. let me say from the outset that the idea of allowing children in the seventh grade or older to hold religious meetings at school does not sound objectionable on the surface. I certainly support religious freedom and expression and the rights of students to engage in religious activities. However. I believe that the effects of this bill if it becomes law would be quite different from its good intentions. I am disappointed that this important legislation is being considered under suspension of the House rules which only allows for 40 minutes of debate and no possibility of amendments. I believe this measure would be much improved if several amendments could be offered today. First. Mr. Speaker. I have great fears that passage of this bill will open our public schools to outside cult membersthe disciples of Reverend Moon. for examplewho may wish to recruit members under the guise of religious study. Under the bill. such groups would be guaranteed access to schools and nonstudent organizers would be able to preach and proselytize young. impressionable students. Parents in my congressional district. I know. want school principals to have the authority to restrict this type of conduct. There is simply too much room for abuse in terms of religious activity. Contrary to the Widmar against Vincent Supreme Court decision which struck down a university policy that permitted recognized student groups to use university rooms for meeting but prohibited student groups from using university rooms for religious worship or teaching. this bill deals with youngsters at a young. impressionable age. Young teenage junior high school and high school students cannot cope intellectually with issues as well as more mature college age students. Public schools. unlike colleges and universities. are not open forums. Furthermore. high school attendance is mandatory. not voluntary as is attendance at a college or university. This bill permits religious meetings on school premises during the school day and is not restricted to meetings before or after school when the compulsory attendance law would not be in effect. This fact makes it that much more objectionable that the bill as written permits nonschool agents of religious groups such as the ""moonies"" to regularly participate in religious meetings on school property. Second. I do not agree with the concept of cutting off all Federal funds to school districts that refuse to allow studentinitiated religious groups in secondary schools to meet during noninstructional periods on the same basis as nonreligious school groups. This provision would have the unfortunate effect of hurting those students who are most in need. If one school in a school district was in violation of the bill. all Federal funding for all schools in that district would be cut off. This would include Federal funds for educating the disadvantaged. for school lunches. and for vocational education. I do not believe that all students in an entire school district should suffer because of a decision made by one school official in one school. Because of this provisioin. religious groups are given prefereutial treatment. because denying access to nonreligious groups does not carry such a severe administrative penalty. In effect. students. parents. and educators would be held hostage to the actions of one school official. Third. I am disturbed that this bill favors majority religions because i a school establishes a minimum number of students to organize a club. that same minimum would apply to religious groups. Surely. this is not fair to minority religions. Unfortunately. an amendment to protect all religions by eliminating .the establishment of a minimum number was defeated in the committee. Because of the manner in which this bill has been brought to the House today. we cannot reconsider this amendment at this time. Mr. Speaker. the issue of access of student religious groups to high school students is now being addressed in the Federal courts. In fact. the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in my home State of Pennsylvania now has a case before it. I believe Congress should await Federal court decisions on this important issue before rushing to pass the legislation before us today. If the courts rule that. religious access to public schools is unconstitutional. no statute passed by Congress can make such access constitutional. If. on the other hand. the courts rule religious access constitutional. I believe decisions regulating such access should be left to local school districts which would respond to the desires of their communities. I do not believe that Congress should now impose a uniforr. nationwide rule. For the above reasons. Mr. Speaker. in spite of the good and honorable intentions of the proponents of this measure. I must oppose H.R. 5345.e"

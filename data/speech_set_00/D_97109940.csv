970049147,"Mr. Chairman. I want to focus attention for a moment on the subject of the Clinch River breeder reactor. The effect of the proposed Republican substitute would be to restore $230 miilon for this unfortunate example of government waste and totally override the decision of the Committee on Science and Technology to deauthorize this project. Incidentally. the $230 million figure is only one part of the total project cost so estimated. upon completion. to exceed $3 billion. It is important to understand that the vote in committee to deauthorize the Clinch River project was taken only after the most extensive consideration. No issue was more exhaustively considered by our committee this year. Moreover the ultimate decision to deauthorize the Clinch River breeder reactor was suppoited on a bipartisan basis. with eight Republicans joining a majority of the committees Democratic members. Indeed. the amendment to deauthorize this project was introduced by a Republican member. Congresswoman CLAUDINE SCHNEIDER of Rhode Island. It is important to understand. in addition. that the committee majority that voted to deauthorize- the Clinch River breeder reactor included not only opponents of nuclear power. but also strong supporters of nuclear power. The reason for the committees decision. and it was a difficult one for the committee to make. was the clear recognition that there is nothing within the entire Federal budget that represents more of a gross waste of taxpayer funds than this particular endeavor. Indeed. following the committee action. as staunch an advocate of nuclear power as Edward Teller extended his congratulations. Dr. Teller wrote: ""Clinch River is technically obsolescent. and its small scale and large cost make it thoroughly inconsistent with badly needed economy in government."" In short. even from the standpoint of the advocates of breeder technology. Clinch River simply makes no sense. It is important to understand. finally. that the Republican substitute proposes not only to restore this classic boondoggle but. to accomplish this illconceived goal. to increase the total Federal energy budget by $39.8 million. We are talking in this instance not about a deeper cut. but about a major addon. Moreover. in order to fully accommodatethe $230 million that the Republicans would add for the Clinch River breeder reactor. the Republican substitute cuts the Science and Technology Committee recommendations for fossil energy. solar energy. geothermal energy. conservation. general science. magnetic* fusion. electric energy systems. and environmental research and development. In short. the Republican substitute not only asks us to invest in a technology that makes no sense. that cannot effectively contribute to the displacement of petroleum. and thatbecause of new estimates of electricity demand and uranium availabilitywill not be commercially viable until the middle of the next century. if then. Not only does the Republican substitute ask taxpayers to continue to fund an absolutely wasteful project. but. more seriously. it deflects precious dollars and resources away from investments in those technologies that will much more rapidly displace petroleum and reduce our countrys No. 1 national security dilemma. namely. our dependence upon foreign oil."
970063189,I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Indiana. I rise In support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleagues. the gentleman from Washington and the gentleman from Pennsylvania . and commend them for their leadership in this important effort. No single issue has dominated the attention of this Congress more than the effort to eliminate wasteful spending. Its an issue worthy of our attention. an issue that has been ignored for far too long. and an issue that now demands our immediate attention. Recognizing the need to put our economic house in order. this Congress recently passed an austerity budget that drasticallyreduced Government spending. But there Is a troubling aspect about this. budget: While it eliminated a vast number of costly Federal entitlementsentitlements. it should be noted. that were designed to address the dilemmas of our countrys most economically -vulnerableit left untouched numerous and -glaring examples of waste and porkbarrel spending. And of all the pockets of waste that remain in the budget. perhaps none Is more deserving of elimination that the TennesseeTombigbee Waterway. From the outset. the benefits of the waterway were grossly overstated. In order to develop a persuasive case for the waterways construction. the Army Corps of Engineers claimed that a multitude of businesses would be able to obtain more expedient and mnore affordable transportation as a consequence of the canals construction. In truth. most of the businesses cited in the corps report either did not exist or denied that they had any Interest in using the canal. Advocates of the waterway claim that its. construction Is necessary to handle the transportation of Increased coal Production. However. a congressional research study released Just this week reports that no major expansion of coal mining Is planned in the parts of Appalachia that the $2 billion canal project is supposed to serve. Simply. we do not need.TennTom. It Is a boondoggle that we can live without. In fact. it Is such a horrible waste of this Nations resources that appropriations should be halted even if the project were under fullscale construction. But thanks to .the wisdom of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals of New Orleans. we need not address that Issue directly. On July 13last Mondaythe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals of New Orleans ordered the district court to Issue an injunction against the river and canal sections of the project. and against all. activity aff ecting the environment of land acquisitions planned after 1971over 35.000 acres of land. The court held that the Army Corps of Engineers had. and I quote: Blatantly violated the National Environmental Policy Act and its own regulations by refusing to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement on the major changes in the TeznnesseeTombigbee Waterway that have occurred since 1971. The court further states thatThe fault lies with the decision of the corps to Ignore its responsibility apd to resist this lawsuit while continuing its default. It would be the height of folly for us to appropriate another $189 million for this project when It has been shown to be unlawful. and has been halted precisely because of that illegality. There are far more important Issues before us than creating a contingency fund for an obsolete and unlawful boondoggle that has been halted by the courts. If we fail to adopt this amendment. we will be throwing very expensive dice Into the darknessa frivolous and foolhardy gesture. I urge adoption of the PritchardEdgar amendment.
970169746,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I want to associate myself fully with the remarks of the gentleman in the well. I rise in support of the recommendations of the Science and Technology Committee and in strong support of the substitute offered by the gentleman from New York. I want to particularly endorse the committee recommendation with respect to funding levels for research in the social and behavioral sciences. Our society is faced with massive changes In Its social. economic. and political environments. On the economic side. we are attempting to fashion policies designed to restore our lagging rate of productivity growth. restrict the inflation that has dominated our national consciousness for most of the past decade. and encourage a new burst of innovation and energy. On the social side. we are faced with massive demographic changesin the number and proportion of elderly people. in average family size. in patterns of family formation and dissolutionas well as with a set of serious problems relating to shifts in urban and regional locations. And on the political side. a significant reallocation of fiscal responsibility from the Federal Government to State and local governments is under active discussion. Achieving a better base of information and understanding for these and other problems is an Important national priority. These problems are in the forefront of concerns in the social and behavioral sciences. and they can be better understood if we devote more resources to research in the social and behavioral programs. Members of this body understand that Investments in knowledge have fully as much pay off as investments In the physical capital of factory buildings and machines. and that investments in knowledge about the functioning of the economy and society. which is what social and behavioral scientists study. have fully as much payoff as investments in knowledge about the physical and biological universe. I therefore urge my fellow Members of the House to support the Peyser substitute. It Is a reasonable compomise between the need for Investments In knowledge and the need for fiscal restraint. It allocates scientific resources equitably and efficiently. It addresses two of our most pressing national priorities: Research in the social and behavioral sciences and the education of young scientists and engineers.
970177249,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to associate myself with his remarks. The issue before us is not whether or not each and every tax expenditure on the list Mr. PEASE has offered for consideration is justified or not. Clearly some are and clearly some are not. For example. I have long supported tax credits for charitable contribu tions. estate tax relief for family farmers and small business owners. the Federal deduction for State and local personal property taxes. and a responsible industrial development bond program. I have also argued that some tax provisionssuch as the safe harbor leasing provisionare in urgent need of reform. Still other provisions of the tax codesuch as wholly unjustified tax breaks for the oil interestsshould be repealed outright. But the Pease amendment does not require the Ways and Means Committee to adopt any specifi& recommendation. It simply expresses the sense of the Congress that the Ways and Means Committee. in its search for ways to raise new revenue. consider closing some of the existing loopholes before it considers raising taxes on average taxpayers. The only real issue before us at this point is that tax expenditures are really nothing more than another form of government spending. albeit a less obvious one. A dollar spent is a dollar spentwhether it goes as a r:ect subsidy or as a tax credit to a bpecial interest group. We have heard Member after Member in this body get up and rail against proposed specific expenditures for medicare or for job training or for education and say nothing about the tax expenditures which are a direct subsidy for particular interests. again maybe justified. maybe not justified. but if I understand what the gentleman in the- well is saying and what the gentleman from Ohio is proposing in his amendment. it is about time that this legislative body begin to look at the issue of tax expenditures in the same way as we would. look at the question of direct expenditures in the budget. To hear the suggestion made that is is somehow inappropriate and an intrusion upon the legislative function of the Ways and Means Committee that this issue of tax expenditures be brought into the debate before this House is to suggest that it i inappropriate for thd Budget Committee or for the House as a whole in its budget deliberations to make any suggestions with respect to the public . policy merits or lack of merits of any specific direct spending item. The reality is that the direct tax expenditure has the same economic impact da the deficit.. It has the same kind of impact as a subsidy into the economy as a direct expenditure. It is the same thing if we say to a specific. interest. ""You do not have to pay your tax bill to the Government."" as to say. .""We are going to give you a special check after you pay the tax bill."" It is about time we begin to look dt tax expenditures in the same way as we look at direct budget expenditures. I commend the gentleman in the well and the gentleman from Ohio for their leadership on this lisue."
970182643,I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to commend the gentleman from Georgia for offering what I regard to be one of the most important amendments that has been offered in the discussion on the budget because it focuses on the question of priorities. I want to briefly discuss the Issue of the Clinch River breeder reactor project. although I would like to emphasize that a more extensive debate on this controversial project will occur during the appropriations process. I would like to remind the Members of this body that the amendment that has been offered is entirely consistent with last years action of the authorizing committee. the Science and Technology Committee. which voted after extensive debatc and hearings to deauthorize that project on a bipartisan vote. We did so because of a recognition that. first of all. the original cost of the project has soared from $669 million to $31 billion. Second. while the original project costs were allocated on a roughly 5050 basis between the private sector and the taxpayer. now it is the taxpayers who would pick up 90 percent of the burden of tilat increased cost that has just soared over the years. Third. none of the economic assumptions used to jub(.ify the project when it was originally conceived have turned out to be valid. The expected demand for electricity has grown at a much slower rate than anticipated. and maximum turns out to be in more plentiful supply than originally thought. Significantly. a recent study by the DOE nuclear laboratory in Los Alamos has concluded that uranium would have to rise to $165 a pound. more than eight times its present cost. before breeder reactors would become an economical replacement for light water reactors. Mr. Chairman. all we will be doing in going ahead with the Clinch River breeder reactor is to divert precious collars away from investments in other technologies. in other energy programs. that will far more quickly and effectively reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign petroleum. and I congratulate the gentleman in the well on his initiative.
970216269,"Madam Chairman. I rise as a cosponsor of H.R. 5320. the Job Training Partnership Act. to urge its approval by the House. This bill. which received strong bipartisan support in the Education and Labor Committee. is designed to attack the widespread and persistent problem of unemployment in this country. No other effort is as deserving of our attention and support. Madam Chairman. my district and State are currently suffering through a period of unemployment unmatched since the Great Depression. While I recognize that this problem can only be alleviated through a comprehensive policy designed to put Americans to work. I believe that job training is an essential component of that policy. Too many factory workers are being laid off from declining industries with little prospect of alternative employment: too many students are graduating from school without the skills to allow them to enter the labor force. H.R. 5320 contains components to address both of these problems. Under this legislation. the newly created job training partnership program would retain much of the existing administrative and delivery system of the CETA program. However. the bill provides for several positive changes to better focus Federal spending on resultsoriented programs. Funding would be provided only for training programs that can provide. the skills for longterm private sector employ. ment. and strong performance standards would insure that programs are run efficiently. Furthermore. the new structure would better utilize the expertise of the business community by creating a coequal administrative partnership between local governments and businessdominated private indus. try councils. Clearly. the participation of local businesses is essential to providing the most appropriate training for available jobs. I believe this partnership. along with the coordinating efforts of State governments. will vastly improve the track record of Federal job training efforts. The Jbb Training Partnership Act is an effective and necessary tool in our effort to reverse the economically debilitating and personally devastating effects of unemployment. For too many Americans. opportunities are sorely lacking in this ""Land of Opportunity."" I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this bill which will extend assistance to those who ask only for the chance to support themselves."
970228748,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to begin by commending the gentleman from Pennsylvania for calling this special order on the important issue of national energy policy. It is remarkable that this critical subject has. in recent months attracted so little public attention. I would like to make a few observations about national energy policy in general. and comment specifically about the future of solar and renewable energy resources. It has been estimated that over $7 trillion will be spent on energy in the United States in the next 20 years. In the best of all possible worldswith the free market working perfectly-.-this $7 trillion would be so efficiently invested that we could meet our Nations energy requirements without any need for a national energy policy. However. as most of us are aware. this is not the best of all possible worlds. The energy marketplace is anything but a perfectly free market. and the policies and practices of powerful energy interests do not always coincide with the interests of the Nation. A comprehensive national energy policy is essential if we are to achieve the goals of economic growth. increased employment. and enhanced national security in the years to come. However. I would emphasize that the Federal Government need not dominate the energy marketplace or expend tremendous sums of taxpayer dollars in an effort to correct market imperfections. In fact. we must avoid past mistakes which have resulted in an energy policy which is little more than a patchwork of ad hoc special interest subsidies that only serve to exacerbate existing market imperfections and to prolong our energy vulnerability by diverting scarce capital into uneconomic. wasteful investments. In my view. the role of the Federal Government should simply be to provide guidance to the marketplace so as to match the Nations present and future energy needs with available resources in the most costeffective. environmentally sound. manner possible. I am convinced that if we were to adopt the commonsense criteria which I have just described. we could rise above the ideological debates of the past. and form a muchneeded consensus on national energy policy. So where do we begin? The first step In meeting the criteria must be an assessment of the Nations end use requirements for heating and cooling. lighting. transportation. and industrial and agricultural processes. The second step must be an analysis of available energy options to determine which can most effectively meet specific energy end use requirements. It is imperative that we take these steps in this order. In the past we have put the cart before the horse by spending large sums of taxpayer dollars in developing costly technologies only to find that there are much more efficient ways to meet our energy needs. For example. numerous studies have indicated that investments in - improved energy efficiency can much more cheaply reduce our dependence upon oil and gas than massive spending on nuclear and synthetic fuels technologies. It is now generally acknowledged that U.S. energy consumption could be reduced by at least 25 percent without sacrificing economic growth. Improving energy efficiency should be the highest priority of our national energy policy. Unfortunately. the current administration has once again put the cart in front of the horse. While continuing to support multibillion expenditures for the Clinch River breeder reactor and the Synthetic Fuels Corp.. the administration proposed reducing energy efficiency funding to only 1 percent of the Department of Energys research and developiment budget. This situation illustrates the importance of establishing criteria to compare the effectiveness of competing energy technologies in meeting the Nations energy requirements. While it is clear that increased energy efficiency should be our No. 1 energy priority. we must also utilize the same criteria to determine which new sources of energy can effectively meet our energy needs as domestic oil and gas supplies become increasingly scarce. I strongly believe that solar and renewable energy technologies are excellent examples of potential energy resources which could meet the criteria that I have suggested. but may need assistance in overcoming market imperfections. These resources must be given the opportunity to aggressively compete with highly subsidized nuclear and synthetic fuels technologies as we move to replace dwindling oil and gas supplies. A number of studies have indicated that solar and renewable energy technologies could provide 20 to 30 percent of our energy supply requirements in the year 2000. Regrettably. the current administration does not share my. enthusiasm about the potential of renewable energy technologies. They consider solar to be an ""exotic"" technology which cannot compete as a viable energy option. Their support for nuclear and synfuels and neglect of solar could make their prediction a selffulfilling prophecy. I believe that if solar is to be given a fair shake in the energy marketplace. there are a number of market imperfections which must be addressed by Federal policy. First. the Federal Government must be committed to a vigorous research program if energy investors are to be given a choice between competing technologies. Unfortunately. the current administration has proposed reducing solar funding to only 4 percent of the Department of Energys research and development budget. The administration justified its proposed budget on the grounds that existing solar tax credits were sufficient incentives for solar development. Second. due to the fact that millions of individual energy consumers are potential investors in solar technology. we must insure that they have adequate access to capital to compete with investments in centralized energy technologies. As incredible as it may seem. the current administration attempted to eliminate the same solar tax credits that it had earlier used to justify its proposed cuts in the solar research and development budget.. Fortunately. a majority of both Houses of Congress expressed their support for the tax credits. In addition. the administration attempted to kill the Energy Conservation and Solar Energy Bank. This Congress created the bank to provide lowinterest loans to attempt to eliminate the barrier of the ""up front"" capital required for ttie purchase of solar technology. It now appears that the bank will finally open its doorsbut only after the administration was sued and lost its case in court. Third. it is critical that the Federal Government provide homeowners. the business community. and the building sector with the solar information necessary to assist them in comparing competing energy investments. While these relatively lowcost programs improve the working of the marketplace. the administration has consistently proposed their reduction. Finally. if solar and renewable energy resources are to be competitive in the marketplace. we must engage in an extensive examination of Federal subsidies for other energy technologies to determine if they remove. or create. imperfections in the marketplace. While the administration has attacked solar programs as inappropri%te meddling in the marketplace. they have also supported substantial subsidies for the nuclear industry. $12 billion in new tax breaks for the oil industry. and have failed to seriously question the role of the Synthetic Fuels Corp. In closing. I believe that it is extremely important to redefine the Federal role in the energy marketplace. It is clearly unrealistic to assert that the Federal Government should either fund every conceivable program or leave all energy decisions to market forces. However. I believe that it is essential for us to agree upon criteria for Federal support for energy technol. ogies which will be consistent from administration to administration if we are to make progress in addressing our energy problems. I believe that the criteria which I have suggested. which would require all energy technologies to fairly compete for Federal support based upon the technologys ability to meet the Nations energy needs in the most costeffective and environmentally sound manner possible. is a formula worthy of consideration."
970229201,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report. Mr. Speaker. I do not think there has been any decision that has been more difficult for me to reach. But I rise today in support of the tax bill before us. convinced that this is the only responsible position I can take. This decision is difficult. because I know full well that there is seldom a constituency in support of legislation that increases tax revenue. it is always much easier to cut than it is to raise taxes. Moreover. there are several features of this legislation that I find personally objectionable and that I would have preferred to see modified or eliminated: I am particularly uncomfortable with the provision mandating the withholding of 10 percent of interest and dividend income. a .th the regressive nature of some of the excise tax increases. and with some of the medicare and medicaid cuts. However. in a package as comprehensive and complex as this. it is inevitable that there will be provisions that trouble each and every Member of this body. The real question that we must ask is: Do the benefits and positive features of this legislation outweigh the more objectionable provisions? And in my judgment. the answer to this question is a resounding and unequivocal yes. There is an urgent need for a midcourse correction in the Administrations economic recovery plan. However wellintended that plan may have been. it simply has not produced the results that had been promised. Instdad of lower Federal spending. what has been produced is higher Federal spending. instead of a balancedFederal budget. we are facing the largest Federal deficits in our history. instead of economic recovery. we are facing an economy on the verge of collapse. The tragic reality is that the combination of a massive supplyside tax cuttotalling $750 billion over 5 yearsin combination with an equally massive defense builduprepresenting a $1.6 trillion expenditure over the same periodundermined the confidence of the financial markets. and resulting high interest rates have plunged the Nation into the deepest economic crisis since the years of the Great Depression. We are now looking toward Federal deficits in excess of $140 billion for the next 3 years. What more compelling indication of the severity of our economic problems can there be than the Presidents decision to ask for this tax increase? Would he have taken an initiative that was certain to be seen as a backtracking from his original program. as an acknowledgement that his program had not generated the desired results. if he were not persuaded that an economic disaster was upon us? It is no secret that I have been highly critical of the Presidents program and of this administrations priorities. But I believe that the President is to be applauded for his willingness. in this time of emergency. to support required modifications in his original program. We can ill afford either continued ideological rigidity or narrow partisanship. In calling for the passage of this bill. designed to correct some of the excesses and unfairness of last years tax cut. the President has taken an important and construction initiative. We really have no responsible alternative but to act favorably upon the tax bill before us: it is a critical first step in achieving the desperately needed midcourse correction in the administrations economic plan. One warning is needed: this is only a first step. in and of itself it will not mean lower interest rates or economic recovery. It is increasingly obvious that we must make further deep cuts in Federal spending. Such cuts. however. must not come from critical domestic programs. but must be taken from those parts of the budget that have. yet to be touched by the budgetcutters and which contain the greatest amount of waste. Specifically. the administrations defense budget must be reexamined and pared down. Given the recent disclosures that $30 billion is wasted annually. there is simply no justification for writing the Pentagon a blank check. Similarly. other ""sacred cows"" in the budgetsuch as the Clinch River breeder reactor and uneconomic water projectsmust be recognized as the pandering to special interest pressures that they are. and be measured against both the real and deserving spending needs that face us and the urgent need to reduce the size of Federal deficits. This legislation deserves bipartisan support for another reason as well: Aside from a few objectionable features. it on balance represents the most significant tax reform legislation to pass through this body in many a decade. Frankly. I began my examination of the conference committee report with some decidedly cynical assumptions about the kind of provisions I expected the bill to contain. But thecloser I looked. the more obvious it became that this legislation contains some extremely important tax reformsreforms that I have publicly and repeatedly supported. I am referring to such provisions as the repeal of the socalled safe harbor leasing provision enacted last year. an increase in the minimum tax paid by the wealthiest individuals. the elimination of the ability of oil companies to use foreign tax credits to avoid U.S. tax on other income. and the closing of a variety of other corporate and specialinterest loopholes. We are finally. in this bill. making some progress in restoring some semblance of equity to the tax code. for a change. it is the special interests rather than the average taxpayer that is faced with most of the new tax burden. A number of provisions of this bill are particularly compelling for a Representative of Michiganthe State with the highest percentage of unemployed workers in the country. For millions of jobless Americans whose unemployment benefits have expired. this legislation offers at least some hope in the form of extended unemployment compensation benefits. in Michigan. a 10week extension is authorized. Moreover. Michigan employers and the fiscally strapped State government come out way ahead under the legislations mandated changes in the system of unemployment insurance financing. The State government stands to gain as much as $114 million in savings in the bills first year. and Michigan employers will be able to avoid literally millions of dollars in additional taxation that would trigger into effect in 1986 without the passage of this legislation. Finally. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the mortgage revenue bond provisions to Michigan. Michigan now leads the country in economic distress. and the housing industry has shouldered a large part of this painful burden. The revisions in the mortgage revenue bond program included in this bill are a longawaited and muchneeded step toward revitalizing our housing industry. This legislation makes sense for the Nation. but it is absolutely obligatory for Michigan. Mr. Speaker. throughout this session of Congress we have been called upon to make important decisions iffecting the present economic climate. Unfortunately. these decisions have too often been molded by partisan conflicts and rigid ideology. We now have an opportunity to move beyond these petty conflicts. The bill before us has been endorsed by the leadership of both parties and has the support of many Members on both sides of the political aisle. It has received the support of many diverse interestsrealtors. homebuilders. workers. small business men and women. and a variety of publicinterest groups. We all share the goal of economic recovery. The administration and the Congress share the responsibility for taking the steps necessary to move us toward the realization of this goal. Economic distress does not discriminate between Republicans and Democrats. We Lre all in this together. It would indeed be a tragedy if this important opportunity to embark upon a true partnership is rejected by this body. Such an action can only postpone indefinitely all of our shared hopes for a substainable economic recovery."
970259863,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. and I want to thank him for taking this special order to provide this opportunity to pay tribute to BILL BRODHEAD. Like the gentleman in the well. I had the very great privilege of serving with BILL BRODHEAD not only in the Congress during these past several years. hut prior to that. during my tenure in the State legislature. So BILL BRODHEAD is far more than simply a colleague. he has become a very close personal frie-.1. and indeed he and his wife are neighbors of ours in McLean. Va. I remember the reputation that BILL enjoyed already at the point when I entered the State legislature. and there as here. during the 4 years I have served in the Congress. I do not ever recall an unkind thing being said of BIL. BRODHEAD. It was not that BILL has ever attempted to avoid the hard issues or the controversies of the day. In fact. he has really been on the cutting edge of the entire progressive agenda in domestic as well as foreign policy. but when BILL has spoken to the issues publicly. whether in committee meetings or on the floor or before the media. he has always done so with the profound sincerity and. conviction that has earned him the respect of his colleagues and the love and respect of his own constituents. In a very real sense. BILL BRODHEAD has been the conscience of our own delegation in Michigan. and I think that his election to the Democratic Study Group chairmanship is probably one of the finest expressions of the tremendous affection in which he has been held by his colleagues in this body. He will be missed. He will be very deeply missed by all of us who have been privileged to work with him. But I know that the commitment that he has brought to his work in the lelgislaLive bodies will carry beyond this body to his activites in his community in Michigan. and I feel quite certain in saying that we have not heard the last of BILL BRODHEAD when it comes to public service. Mr. Speaker. I simply want to joint this evening with the gentleman in the well in extending my very best wishes to both BILL and Kathy BRODHEAD and their entire family. We shall miss him.
970262253,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to commend him on taking this special order to mark the 34th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly. Mr. Speaker. today we mark the 34th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly. The Universal Declaration is one of the landmark documents of our time. For over three decades. it has been a beacon of hope for the worlds poor. tortured. and oppressed. The Universal Declaration puts forth a vision of a world in which governments recognize and respect the inherent dignity and inalienable human rights of all men. This vision is more than an idealistic. utopian plan for universal freedom. justice. and peace. The Universal Declaration embodies the hope for a world order in which respect for human rights is a basic. indispensable component of international stability. The Universal Declaration recognizes that order based on force and repression is temporary and illusory. Only by guaranteeing basic human rights can the nations of the world hope to establish an international framework in which the peace we all desire can be achieved. The anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights also provides us the opportunity to pause and reflect on our own national commitment to human rights. Can we say today that our Government has made human rights a key element of our foreign policy? Have our efforts to promote human rights progressed or receded during the past year? Has our foreign policy shown as much compassion for the oppressed as it has concern for those regimes which are important for our security but where corruption and oppression are hallmarks of domestic policy? I believe strongly that promotion of human rights is not simply a nice thing to do in a foreign policy when it does not get in the way of what are often termed ""overriding security concerns."" Human rights are an important national interest of our country. Foreign policies which ignore basic human freedoms will continue to be selfdefeating. They make no contribution to our longterm security Interests. whether in Central America. southern Africa. the Far East. or Eastern Europe. When we turn a deaf ear to movements of social protest in countries where we have major security or economic interests. when we come to be viewed by native populations as the prop for repressive regimes. we not only violate our own national principles but we do major violence to our own national selfinterest. This anniversary also gives us time to reflect on the work of the human rights organizations and advocates throughout the world. who have labored to promote human freedom often under the most oppressive and dangerous conditions. The Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina. the Catholic Vicariate and Human Rights Commission in Chile. Solidarity in Poland: Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia. the var* lous Helsinki Watch groups in Eastern Europe. the Catholic Church in El Sal. vador and the Philippines. Beyers Naude. Winnie Mandella and Bishop Desmond Tutu in South Africa. Andrei Sakharov. Yuri Orlov. and Anatoly Scharansky in the Soviet Unionthe list could go on and on. These groups and individuals remain. for all of us who care deeply about human rights. courageous proponents of human dignity and human freedom in what sometimes seem the most hopeless situations. They remind us that the principles so eloquently enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are alive and cannot be crushed. We owe it to these advocates of human freedom to rededicate ourselves today to a strong and forceful human rights emphasis in our foreign policy."

980016733,Mr. Speaker. as we approach the date of Greek independence. I feel it is very important for me to speak out against that portion of the administrations foreign assistance program that would increase aid for Turkey and change the military assistance ratio between Greece and Turkey. In an effort to achieve a degree of stability in the eastern Mediterranean region. the House Foreign Affairs Committee last May reaffirmed the 7to10 military aid ratio for both Greece and Turkey. The committee felt thenand there is no evidence to support any change nowthat this was the best means of contributing a more evenhanded approach to matters in the area. In fact. there is every reason to support the 7to10 ratio. At a time when the U.S. Government is negotiating with Greece for continuing use of military facilities in that country in order to maintain the strength of NATO in the eastern Mediterranean. a change in foreign assistance in favor of Turkey could well damage those negotiations and weaken our presence just when it is most necessary. Besides. if the administrations proposal is aimed at forcing Greece to renew the terms for use of the military facilities. history has shown that such attempts at blackmail have failed miserably. One other point. Greece is an old friend and ally of the United States. Greece is a proven defender of American interests in Europe and around the world. Is this any way to treat a nation whose people are staunch supporters of and contributors to American ideals and the American way of life? It is also important to recognize that Turkish authorities have been unwilling or unable to reach a settlement of the Cyprus question. an issue that has dragged on for some years. . Is it reasonable to assume that a change in military assistance in favor of Turkey over Greece will encourage the Turkish Government to come to terms that will permit freedom for those Cypriots living within the boundaries of Turkish control? To me. it is not only unlikely. It will be nearly impossible. To offer more aid to Turkey is to encourage that country to continue its hardline attitude against coming to a settlement on Cyprus and could lead to further encroachment by Turkey in the Aegean Sea. Such a possibility brought about by a change in the military assistance formula will damage the United States and NATO in the effort to provide protection in the eastern Mediterranean. I am a Greek American. and I say that proudly. But I am also a patriot. I believe we should do what is in the best interests of the United States. And. in this case. our course is clear. We must maintain the existing 7to10 military aid ratio between Greece and Turkey. That action. I feel confident. could very well encourage the Greek Government to resolve the question of U.S. bases in that country and could show Turkish authorities that the United States believes a fair settlement of the Cyprus question is still of importance and is long overdue.
980019715,"Mr. Speaker. it is a great honor for me. the son of immigrant Greek parents. to stand before this House to honor the people of my heritage as we approach the 162d anniversary of the Greek war of independence from the Ottoman Empire. Friday. March 25. is that special day. It is a day when Greeks the world over bow their heads in prayer. thanking God for helping us achieve our liberation and. at the same time. cheer the Greek peoples spirit and determination to be free. On March 25. 1821. just 45 years after this country announced its own freedom. the Greek people. with the help of expatriate Greeks. other Europeans. and Americans. began a 6year struggle for freedom and independence from Turkey. This freedom was finally achieved in October 1827 when the Turkish fleet was destroyed. Like the American Revolutionary War. the Greek struggle was not an easy one. If you do any reading about the American war of Independence. you will find remarkable similarities. As Gen. George Washington had difficulties keeping his army together. so did the Greeks. As Washington had trouble unifying his command. so did the Greeks. The same can be said for raising money. finding arms. and so on. But. like Washington and the American people. the Greeks finally achieved their desired goalto be a free people living in an independent nation. As a Greek. who is also a loyal American and a patriot. I take great pride in the close relationship between America and Greece that has existed for so many years. During the darkest days of World War II. when it appeared the forces of Hitler and Mussolini would overrun Europe with little resistance. the Greek people denied those Axis powers the easy occupation of their country. Many Greeks died delaying the Axis takeover of the Greek peninsula and we must remember those Greeks died in the tradition of their forefathers who threw off the mantle of the Ottoman Empire. They fought tirelesqly. without fear but with dignity. knowing the ultimate goal was most Important to them. After World War II. America recognized its debt to the Greek people for their resistance to the Axis forces. In 1946 and 1947. when the Communists sought a foothold in that country. then President Harry Truman included Greece in his economic and military assistance program. This was later followed by the Marshall plan which provided the economic support to enable the Greeks to defeat the Communist threat. During the Grecian war of independence. three noted Americans offered support to the Greek cause. Former President Thomas Jefferson proclaimed his interest in the Greek struggle and suggested that once independence was achieved. the Greek people might find a model for their new constitution in the U.S. Constitution. considering it ""a tribute rendered to the names of your Homer. your Demosthenes whose blood is still flowing in your veins."" President James Monroe made an enthusiastic declaration in favor of Greek freedom. saying: A strong hope is entertained that these people will recover their independence and resume their equal station among the nations of the world. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. who would succeed Monroe as President. said: The people of the United States * sympathizing with the cause of freedom and independence wherever its standard is unfurled. behold with peculiar interest the display of Grecian energy in defence of Grecian liberties. and the association of heroic exertions. at the present time. * * * If in the progress of events. the Greeks should be enabled to establish and organize themselves into an independent nation. the United.States will be among the first to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with them. The words of these three great Americans encouraged many American volunteers to come to Greece to help the cause of freedom and independence. Many of these Americans saw themselves as so many LaFayettes. a comparison the old general himself did not discourage during his visit to the United States in 1824. While I recognize the close ties between the United States and. the Greek people and applaud the words of Jefferson. Monroe. and Adams and the deeds of the many Americans who fought in Greece during the early 1820s. I must make special mentioft of a real hero of the Greek war of independence. The contribution of Lord George Gordon Byron. the British poet. is unequaled by any other single person. During the war of independence. Byron led his own brigade to Greece. He also was responsible for raising substantial sums of money for the Grecian war effort. Unfortunately. Byron died in Greece before he was able to have much impact on the battle scene. But Byrons greatest contribution to the Greek cause was made long before the actual fighting started. Byrons proGreek sympathies stemmed from his visits there in 1809 and 1810. The impressions made on his romantic spirit during his time in Greece led to some of his greatest literary works. These works. which glorified the Greeks of old and compared them to the modern Greeks. served as a catalyst for the Greek cause among educated Europeans of the day. In fact. because of Byrons poetry. the educated public adopted Byrons romanticized sentiments of Greece in accepting three ideas that led to the growth of philhellenism in Europe. The three ideas were: Ancient Greece had been a paradise inhabited by supermen. modern Greeks were the true descendents of the ancient Greeks. and. a war against the Turks would regenerate the modem Greeks and restore former glories. I would like to read excerpts from two of Byrons works that perhaps captured his feelings best and stirred the imaginations of the Europeans. The first Is from the ""Siege of Corinth."" written in 1816. some 5 years before the Greek people actually began their war of independence. Despite of every yoke she bears. That land is glorys still and theirst Tis still a watchword to the earth: When man would do a deed of worth He points to Greece. and turns to tread. So sanctioned. on the tyrants head: He looks to her. and rushes on Where life is lost or freedom won. The second poem segment. and probably the most famous. is from Canto III of ""Don Juan."" written in 1821: The mountains look on MarathonAnd Marathon looks on the sea. And musing there an hour alone. I dreamd that Greece might still be free. For standing on the Persians grave. I could not deem myself a slave. Mr. Speaker. the long and glorious history of Greece has always been a struggle to preserve the dignity of man: His independence. his freedom. his equality before the lawall ideals which we cherish in our own Constitution and the American Declaration of Independence. The Greek people. too. share these ideajs and have fought time and time again to achieve them."
980038790,"Madam Speaker. I am delighted to have this opportunity to join In the commemoration of National Small Business Week. There is no segment of our economy more important than our small business men and women. Not only do they represent the backbone of our economy. but it is to these small business men and women that we must look if we are to solve our countrys unemployment woes. The Fortune 500 companies. as vital as they are to our Nations economy. are not going to provide the new jobs necessary to bring the unemployment rate down. And they are not going to create the jobs necessary to meet the needs of future generations. Let us face it. our Nations automobile factories and steel mills are never going to employ as many men and women as they once did. They are being forced to go heavily into automation in order to compete with foreign producers. So the new jobs this country needsand needs desperately in some areasare going to have to come from small business. They are going to have to come from the existing businesses which expand their work force from 10 to 20 or 10 to 50. They are going to have to come from the man or woman with a new idea. a new concept. who has the courage and the determination to go into business for himself. These individuals are out there. What they need is encouragement. What they need is a climAte in which they can prosper. And that is the job of Congress. All too often. in the past. the laws we passed and the rules and regulations sparked by those laws have served to place virtually unbearable burdens on small businesses. In effect. we have done a great deal to discourage small business and the creativity and entreprenurial spirit it represents. Recently. however. the climate has improved. Many of the actions of the 97th Congress eased the burden on small business. Not enough. but at least. it was a start. So. as we in the House of Representatives take this time to commemorate National Small Business Week and honor the men and women who are our small businesses. I hope we will also dedicate ourselves to creating the kind of climate in which they can grow. prdsper. and flourish. That is why I wanted to serve on the House Committee on Small Business. to help bring about that climate. As a former small businessman myself. I know all too well Just how onerous some of the demands placed on business by this Government can be. And I know how difficult it can be meeting a Payroll. But. I also know. that if we in the Congress will create the right climate. the entrepreneurial spirit which made this country what it is today will once again come to fore. And when it does. we will see a national economic vitality unmatched by anything we have seen in recent years. All we have to do is water the ground in which small business takes root. and help the entrepreneur learn to tend the crop. For that reason. Mr. Speaker. I will be sponsoring a small business conference in the Ninth Congressional District of Florida next month. The conference. entitled ""For the Nations FutureHelping Small Business Succeed."" will be held June 25 at Clearwater Beach. An I am hopeful we can provide the kind of assistance and expertise which will enable the small business men and women of the area to prosper and flourish.e"
980062805,Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to this betrayal of the American taxpayers. Let there be no mistakethis proposed cap on the July 1 tax cut is a working couples tax increase. And at a time when the economy is making. sure. but fragile. progress toward recovery. the country can ill afford to take more money out of the wallets of working Americans and to undermine the incentives to work and save which the Presidents tax relief plan has created. Claims that this third year tax cut benefits only the wealth are pure nonsense. Almost half of those affected by this cap have incomes under $50.000. It is also interesting to note that a recent Gallup poll showed that 55 percent of all respondents favor putting the tax cut into effect as scheduled and. interestingly. that among respondents with incomes between .15.000 and $25.000. 64 percent support the tax cut. It is the middle class who will be hurt by this cap. just as it has been the middle class who has had to bear the brunt of so many failures by Congress to see beyond the political expediency of spend. spend. spend budget policies that necessitate tax increases. As a small businessman and member of the Small Business Committee. I am particularly distressed that we would consider a measure which would make it more difficult for this important sector of the economy to grow and prosper. Eightysix percent of small businesses pay taxes under individual rather than corporate tax schedules and this meansthat -nearly 2.5 million small businesses will see their taxes increased if this $700 cap is approved. Does this say to the Nations small businessmen and businesswomenthe backbone of our economy and. I believe. the key to recoverythat we want them to suceed? No. It just makes it harder for them to do so. The problem is not the willingness of the American taxpayers to pay their fair share. but the willingness of the American Congress to make tough choices. I submit that we will never see complete recovery until we have a Congress with the discipline to stop spending taxpayers money as if it was their own and the wisdom to stop penalizing initiative. hard work. and success as if they were national embarrassments rather than tremendous national resources. of which I. for one. am very proud. Our constituents cannot afford any more taxes. Let us stand up for their rights and vote this irresponsible increase down.
980165162,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding Mr. Speaker. we are here today on a matter of human rights. human dignity. and justice. We are here today to ask the leaders of the Soviet Union to live up to those International agreemettts to which they have already agreed and to allow the hundreds of thousands of Soviets Jews to emigrate. if they choose. to practice their religion without fear of arrest or mistreat. ment. and to preserve their heritage by studying their history and culture. and by teaching it to their children. Some 86 years ago. the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. a document to which all membernations of the United Nations supposedly subscribe. That Universal Declaration of Human Rights states. in no uncertain terms. that no one dwelling in a U.N.member country should be subjected to the kinds of Iniquities that. in fact. the Soviet Union perpetrates against Soviet Jews. Just consider article 8 of the Universal Declaration: ""Everyone has the right to life. liberty and the security of person."" Or Article 4: No one shall be held in slavery or servitude * Mae. IA 1984 Or Aticle 8: ""No one shall be subJected to torture or to cruel. inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."" Or Article 9: ""No one shall be subjacted to arbitrary arrest. detention or exile."" Eight years ago today. Soviet Jewish activist Anatoly Shcharansky was arrested and Is still serving a 13 year prison term. There are numerous examples of other Soviet Jews who have lost Jobs. been denied basic human rights. and suffered other indignities just because they asked to emigrate. And just a few months ago. during the stewardship of Yurly Andropov. the Soviet Union displayed its callous disregard for human life and dignity again. this time by blatantly murdering 209 Innocent men. women. and children. who. unfortunately. were simply passengers on a Korean Air Lines flight that accidently strayed Into Soviet airspace. But Andropov can easily he recognied for his brutal miatreatment of the Soviet Jews. During hil year and a half as Chairman. he has systemal teally denied even the most basic human rights to a single class of people residing In the Soviet Union- the Jews. Emigration of Soviet Jews has been dropping since the high of 51.820 In 1979. but during 1982 and 1983. only about 4.000 Jews were allowed to leave. Emigration efforts were made more difficult. emigration applianits continued to be subjected to oppressive measures such as dismianal from employment and imprisonment. and the practice of the Jewish religion and study of Jewish culture was severely rest ricted. All of these actions are in direct violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. None of us here are so naive as to believe that the Soviet Union will change its attitude on the basis of what we say here. but. perhaps. the new leadership there will recognise that we --as individuals. as Congressmen. and as Americanswiti not ignore their treatment of the Soviet Jews. their denial of those basic human rights to whih all are entitled. All of us here today- those parti(cipating as well as those who are with us in spirit--sincerely hope that the new Soviet Chairman. Constantin Cherenko. will understand our concern and will lift the burden from the backs of those who seek to leave the Soviet Union or prefer to stay and practice their religion. Today I. an International Day of Concern for Soviet Jews. It is a day the community of man has set aside to pay tribute to those Soviet Jews who are suffering all kinds of indignities because they desire to be free. We in this country must speak out. For more than 200 years. the United States has been the symbol of freedom to oppressed people throughout the world. If we fail to recommit ourselves to speaking on behalf of all the oppressed. then we have failed to live up to our own heritage s Amerloans as established in our Declaration of Independence. Chairman Ohernenho. we call upon you to set an example to all Soviet olti. sens. We ask you. as your nations new leader. to restate the Soviet Unions commitment to those basic principles as espoused In the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to live up to those principles by opening the Soviet Unions doors and allowing those Soviet Jews who wish to emigrate to do so. Both you. Chairman Chernenko. and President Reagan have said that this is a time for a new beginning between our two countries. a time to renew relationships. Let your actions on behalf of Soviet Jewry be a first step in that new beginning. L] 1810"
980166527,Mr. Speaker. it is an honor for me. Mr. Speaker. to have requested this annual special order to commemorate the approaching 163d March t4 1984 OO anniversary of the OGeak Wr of Independence. And. while this day has a special meaning for methe so of Greek imigrantsand other GreekAmericans. this day also has become a day of celebration for all In the free world. marking as it does the rebirth of the nation known as the Mother of Democracy. This Sunday. March 25. is the actual day that the Greeks declared their independence from the Turkish Empire. This historic date. however. was not chosen at randnm. Rather. March 25 was selected because it marks the feast day of the Annunilationthe day. according to Christian teachings. that God delivered mankind from sin. Knowi ng full well the religious importance of March 25. the Greek leaders of the revolutionary movement chose it to announce to the world their emancipation from 500 years of darkness and slavery. And. in commemorating this hihtoric event. Greek communities throughout the world re dedicate themselves to the Ideals of the war of independence: freedom and human dignity. The struggle for Independence by the Greeks was a long and difficult one. covering a 6year period. The end result. though. was the glorious rebirt h of the Greek nation. Much like our own War of Independence. the Greek cause did not find a quick and easy resolution. Finances were scarce. confusion was the rule. individual revolutionary groups were often Isolated and unable to coordinote their pat.riotic efforts in the battl e for freedom. Yet. despite all of these difflultlies. the common cause of liberty united the Greeks and their allies. And. even though overwhelmingly outnumbered. the small bands of heroes carried on a form of guerrilla warfare. following the patterns of their ancestors. And. while most Europeans were dismayed by the hitandrun tacties used by the Greek lighters. the methods were remarkably effective and militarily sound and. in the final analysis. proved to be rewarding. The Greek cause is signifirant for all of us. as it was an event that clearly piaralleled our own quest for freedom from a tyrannical monarchy. In this war of independence. the Greek people fought for the same principles we take to our own heartsliberty. life. and the pursuit of happinessthe principles we espouse in our Declaration of Independence. And as we Americans declared ourselves to be free and independent of the British rule. so. too. did the Greeks declare themselves to be free and separate from the Turks. throwing off the yoke of bondage. The praiseworthy efforts of those Greek patriots did not go unnoticed. Their cause %as soon given support by Europeans and Amerleans. who raised money. bought arms. and sent men to join the fight.
980183653,"I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker. I wish to commend my colleague from Ohio for requesting this special order on Cyprus today. I believe this is a most worthwhile effort. and hope that our words will bring attention to the very serious problems which continue to exist on a longtroubled Island. I first want to state that todays remarks come at a most significant and important time. as we have just witnessed another reversal in the peace negotiations on Cyprus. Exactly 1 week ago yesterday. the nation of Turkey and its puppet government on northern Cyprus exchanged Ambassadorsan action that has caused growing concern throughout the world and among many concerned individuals here in America. In fact. a State Department spokesman was quoted as saying that the exchange of Ambassadors ""has caused us deep concern because it could set back United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellars effort to win a negotiated solution."" I. for one. am in complete agreement with this assessment. and would even go a bit further to predict that this action will definitely impede any progress in future attempts at negotiation. I believe this action by Turkey. the only nation and I repeat and emphasize. the only nation to officially recognize the unilateral declaration of independence by the TurkishCypriot community. is a direct rebuke to the requests of the United States and other nations which have sought a reversal to the recognition of this illegal state. It appears that instead of willfully cooperating and working for a tited Cyprus. Turkey has added another dimension to the already complex situation which dominates events on Cyprus. For almost 10 years since the initial invasion of Cyprus by Turkey. I believe we have been patient. but that we have seen little. if any. progress. And to be quite honest. I believe the patience of this Congress and of many Americans has worn thin. One area where I believe our patience is being stretched to the limit is in the provision of foreign aid and military assistance to Turkey. At a time when we are confronted by large budget deficits. it is difficult to understand why we should continue to indirectly support the Turkishoccupying forces through our financial and military aid programs. In this regard. relevant committees in both the House and Senate have already taken initial steps to curtail U.S. assistance to Turkey. It is my hope that if progress continues to lag. the full Congress will act and send a clear message to Turkey and the TurkishCypriot community that we are tired of waiting and hearing false promises. In addition. perhaps the time has also come for Congress to consider other measures to address Turkeys actions and the illegal state on Cyprus. Adding new conditions or limitations on U.S. assistance to Turkey is. in my mind. a viable option. Altogether. I believe the important point is that action Is needed now. Now is not the time to wait. Now is not the time for Congress to sit back. and approve full funding for military and economic assistance to Turkeyto act. In effect. as if nothing has happened in the past year. Something has happened. An illegal state has been declared and Turkey has acted to accommodate the existence of this state. I would ask this Congress how we can possibly ignore these events and the continuing division of Cyprus. I would ask this Congress how can we pretend that there has been any progress. when. in fact. there have been new impediments constructed to a united Cyprus. I do not believe we can sit idly by. Action is needed now. Otherwise. I am afraid that Cyprus will remain indefinitely divided. and that Turkeys act of neocolonialism will become a precedent for other nations to follow. In effect. if we do not act. we will be saying to the world that Turkeys actions are acceptable and that the United States will only engage in empty rhetoric."
980194706,"Mr. Speaker. I wish to commend my colleague from New York . for requesting this special order on the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicarean organization that has presented misleading information to millions of older Amercians. Somehow this organization has led our seniors to believe that they are in danger of losing their social security and medicare benefits. Regretfully. a former Member of Congress is largely responsible for thisone. who certainly knows that this body has no intention of ever taking any action which would be destructive to the social security and medicare benefits which have been solemnly promised to our people. as he states in his mailing. I commend my colleague and those that have joined us for taking the time to clarify this matter. Recently. our offices have been flooded with phone calls and letters from concerned seniors who are often panic stricken. and who are trying to find answers to the confusion that this organization has caused. I am proud to say that a letter from Members of the Select Committee on Aging is being sent to Mr. Roosevelt. requesting clarification on the national committee that he heads. as well as it is goals and activities. It is our purpose. in sending this letter. to not only gain a better understanding of the committee. but also to protect the citizens we represent. Hopefully. Mr. Roosevelt is watching this evening and will take the time to prepare a proper and responsible response to Congress and the citizens of this Nationsomething. I believe he owes us. The growing awareness and concerns over this national committee seem to increase each day. Several major newspapers have carried feature articles on this issue. The National Council of Senior Citizens has requested a congressional hearing on the matter. And now. Members of Congress have brought the matter to the floor of the House. Certainly something must be done. I believe that it is important that our seniors remember that their elected officials will defend and protect their rights. The doors of the Members of this Congress are always open. and we are ready and willing to listen. It does not take a membership fee to any type of national organization to express ones thoughts on matters. We are elected to represent these people and I. personally. am offended by the deceiving language that this organization uses. especially. with the words ""The politicians say we cant afford Social Security and Medicare."" I represent the Nations fastest growing areas of older Americans. And. believe me. there is no way I would ever make statements of this sort. In fact. I have already cosponsored legislation. along with Congressman PEPPER. in addition to having written the President. to form a bipartisan Commission on Medicare. as was done with social security. to insure its financial stability and solvency. In closing. I again wish to commend my colleague and hope that the older Americans of this Nation are watching and know that this Congress is ready to take action on this matter. I also challenge Mr. Roosevelt. if he really cares about the elderly. to come forth and clarify his position and the work and activities of his organization.e"
980260036,"Mr. Speaker. my colleagues. I am both pleased and disappointed to be participating in todays special order on behalf of Soviet Jewry. I am pleased. first of all. that I have the right to speak out against injustice. As an American. this rightthis freedom to act on my beliefs and convictionsis something I usually take for granted in both my public and personal lives. It is only at times like thiswhen we pause to call attention to those who are denied this rightthat I fully appreciate how blessed I am to live in a free country in which the rights of the individual are so highly valued. Second. I am pleased to have this opportunity to join with my colleagues in the House of Representatives in a truly humanitarian effort. Because we have the right to voice our convictions. I believe we also have a responsibility to make our voices heard on behalf of those who do not have that right. If there is but one way we can help the Soviet Jews who are denied the freedoms we cherish. it is by marshalling the strength of public opinion behind their just cause. We know that the leadership of the Soviet Union is sensitive to international public opinion and can be influenced by the actions of the American Congress. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromykos visit to Washington this week to meet with President Reagan and Secretary of State Shultz provides us with a most appropriate chance to reiterate our strong opposition to Soviet policy with regard to the Soviet Jewish population. Perhaps the Student Coalition for Soviet Jewry put it best when they gave us this mandate: ""Thou shalt not stand idly by."" So. I am pleased that I have both the right and the opportunity to speak out against Soviet antiSemitism. This is an issue of great concern to me. to my constituents. and to all Americans and I hope our message will not fall on deaf ears. My disappointment in todays special order comes. of course. from the fact that it is necessary at all. What a tragedy it is that the Soviet Union not only allows antiSemitism to exist in Soviet society. but. indeed. officially sanctions this religious and cultural discrimination. In 1979. emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union reached a peak of 4.000 per month. In 1983. only 1.314 Jews received permission to leave. This drastic decrease in Jewish emigration has been paralleled by equally ominous increases in the harassment and arrest of Jewish citizens who seek to emigrate or to practice their religion and heritage. The creation of the spurious Anti Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public Is a particularly distasteful development. Attempts by the committee and the Soviet press to legitimize ludicrous claims about the lack of hopeful Jewish emigrants waiting to leave the Soviet Union are a frightening indication of the depth of official Soviet antiSemitism. While general facts and figures such as this are alarming. the sorrowful plight of Soviet Jewry becomes most real when we look at the experiences of individuals and families. One Soviet refusenik in which I have a particular interest is David Goldfarb of Moscow. whom I have adopted. Mr. Goldfarb first applied to emigrate to Israel in 1979. His son. Alexandr. had been allowed to emigrate in 1975. after a long and arduous battle with Soviet authorities. but David. his wife Cecilia and their daughter Olga and her family have been denied permission to be reunited with their son and brothr. Like so many other Soviet Jews. David Goldfarbs visa request was denied on the grounds that his departure from the Soviet Union was considered undesirable for state reasons. What is unique and alarming. however. is that this reasoning suggests that the Soviet Union considers the entire area of molecular genetics to be a matter of state security. At the time of his initial emigration request. Mr. Goldfarb was head of the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Bacteria and Bacteriophages of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences. and was involved in gene cloning research. None of his work involved military matters and he did not have a security clearance. yet his knowledge is considered to be Important to the security of the state. My letters to Mr. Goldfarb have thus far gone unanswered. Harassment. repression. alienation. separation from familythese are the trappings of life for Jews in the Soviet Union. We are as removed from a life of repression as Soviet Jews are from a life of freedom. We cannot keep silent. .then. when we have the ability to speak out and be heard on their behalf. So. I say to Mr. Chernenko. to Mr. Gromyko and to all Soviet leaders. that the United States and her people do care about those you have chosen to persecute and will not keep silent in our opposition. We urge you to abide by the agreements your country has signed and to let a senseof humanity guide your emigration policies. We implore you to let Soviet Jews and all Soviet citizens live and worship as they so choose."
980266858,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support fo H.R. 4209. the Small Business and Federal Procurement Competition Enhancement Act. As a member of the Small Business Subcommittee on Oversight I particlpated in the hearings which focused on the costly procurement practices of the Federal Government and the competition barriers faced by small business. We have all been shocked by the significant overcharges for spare parts. and this is a matter of extreme concern to my constituents. These overcharges were made crystal clear when I joined Chairman BEDELL for a visit to a Pensacole base where we saw $430 pliers which we could purchase for $3. not to mention a 1by1inch decal for which the Government paid $40.80. I want to commend the chairman for his diligence in pursuing Lgislative remedies to these abuses. It is obvious to all of us that the Federal Treasury simply cannot afford waste and overpriced goodsnot when we are trying to stretch our scarce resources to provide for the needs of the elderly. unemployed. and poor. not to mention finding solutions to our deficit. It is incumbent upon this Congress to encourage competition in all Federal procurement programs. and this means ensuring that the small business community. which has much to offer. has a free and fair opportunity to participate in Federal contracting. It has been shown time and time again that competition for Federal contracts produces a reduction in costs to the Federal Government. When companies of all sizes are given- an equal opportunity to compete for contracts. the overall cost to the Government is diminished. Our hearings showed that small business only receives about 17 percent of all Federal contracts. I fully believe that this minimal participation by small business is indicative of a lack of competition in Government contracting and lends itself to outrageous prices for goodsDaid for by the taxpayers. Mr. Speaker. I am especially pleased that the legislation before us today mandates that Federal procurement personnel will be encouraged. through their yearly performance evaluations. to increase competition and achieve cost savings. There is no doubt in my mind that if we are to succeed in revamping noncompetitive costly procurement practices. the responsibility must be shared by the Federal employees who are involved in the awarding of contracts. and who have a responsibility to the taxpayers. I am optimistic that with passage of this bill we will be opening the door to small business and at the same time. restoring fiscal integrity to our Federal procurement programs. I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R.

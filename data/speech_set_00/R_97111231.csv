970018688,The Senator will yield when he has completed his remarks. if the Senator from Michigan does not mind. The assumptions which underlie this resolution involve perhaps as many as 100 or so specific programs. a few of which will be eliminated entirely. others of which will be cut below the dollar level with which they were supported in 1980 and 1981. and others of which will merely grow less rapidly than might otherwise have been the case. But to the extent this entire package affects more deeply one section or one group of States in the United States of America than it does others. it will do so only because and only to the precise extent that those programs have disproportionately favored those areas of the country since the time at which they were originally put into place. Very few of the Senators on the floor of this body have dealt with their votes on specific issues which have come before the Senate since this debate began on the basis of the precise effect of those proposals on their individual States. I must confess that I do not know whether my own State is affected slightly above or slightly below the average of all the other States. While it is not in the Northeast or in the Middle West. it shares some \trban characteristics of some portions of those States. But I do know there are. very specific proposals such as those dealing with Public Health Service hospitals. which very much disproportionately affect my own State. I believe the people of my State understand. however. the overriding necessity for a program of this nature in order to create conditions under which economic recovery Is possible or we hope very. very likely. It seems to me fundamentally in error to deal with this resolution or with any other simply on the basis of a chart which illustrates how many dollars are returned to specific States in respect of how many dollars in taxes are collected within those States. I might say parenthetically. because my own State is slightly above the average in that respect. I dealt extensively with that issue during the course of my campaign in 1980. not entirely unsuccessfully. Nevertheless. so much of those figures are skewed by payments under social security programs to those who are retired. and so much more based on military spending. much of which was explained eloquently and accurately by the Senator from New York in his own remarks so as to make such figures almost meaningless. If we were able and willing constitutionally to require that people retire in the States in which they have earned their living. the ratio on these charts would show better for the State of Michigan and. I suspect. North Dakota and a number of other States. But we are not about to do that In the areas in which people receive social security payments because that is simply not relevant to an argument over a budget resolution of this nature nor. I suspect. is military spending. I hope and I trust we will constantly work in this body for the most effective use of our military budget. the most effective stationing of our military forces. without regard to specific location. If we should ever go to a situation. which is implied in this amendment. that military bases should be placed throughout the United States in precise proportion to the amount of taxes paid by the citizens of the respective States. we would most certainly be wasting infinitely more money on our Military Establishment than anyone claims we are doing at the present time. Next. of course. this resolution is not the entire economic recovery package. We will be dealing on a far broader basis with Federal spending in the course of the first budget resolution In the next week or the next month. That will deal with military spending. which this does not: that will deal with taxation policies. which this does not. We have much more to come. Technically. at least. this amendment is simply irrelevant to a resolution which deals with specific and particular goals by making assumptions about specific and. particular programs. Every Senator has the right to make different assumptions and to try to persuade this body that those assumptions should be changed. Many Senators have made exactly such attempts. and there has been a high level of debate on specific policies here during the course of the last week. This amendment. to the extent that it is only hortatory. is meaningless. To the e:tent that it has any meaning it is totally contrary to the entire purposes of the Budget Act. We will have many opportunities to debate these ideas and questions of national fairness about specific programs directed at specific people during the course of the future. But this program deals with people. It asks sacrifices of people not of States. It is designed for economic recovery for people not for States. The amendment should. therefore. be rejected.
970027042,Mr. President. It Is paradoxical to hear this amendment presented by the Senator from Massachusetts with his great and longstanding concern for programs for the needy. because what he proopses to do Is to provide out of the taxpayers pocket a subsidy for the very taxpayers who do not wish to pay those taxes and who do not need the subsidy As a result of what this Senate has already done in connection with th e reconciliation program in restoring some $300 million for child nutrition. the present budget Includes funds sufficient to insure that no child receiving a free or a reducedprice lunch this year need have any reduction in benefits for that kind of program in fiscal year 1982. What the administration has done Is to focus Federal meal subsidies. Federal lunch subsidies. on children from families in need and. at the same time. pro.. poses In the course of the next 5 years to save close to some $7 billion in connection with the budget which. as we all know. is dangerously out of balance. This program. incidentally. the national school lunch program. ha3 grown more than 400 percent in expenditures during the decade of the 1970s. from slightly over $0.5 billion to some $3 billion. Federal expenditures for child nutrition programs in general have grown during that period of time from threequarters of a billion dollars to over $4 billion. Actually. of course. national school enrollments have been declining rather than gaining during recent years. But. nevertheless. this school lunch program has shown an increase in cost and in spending. At the present time. the Federal Government supports approximately 82 percent of the cost of a lunch which is served free to a needy student. 75 percent of the cost of a reducedprice lunch. and almost onequarter of the cost of the lunch for which an individual pays and for which that individuals family can well afford to pay. The real issue. the true issue. In connection with this amendment is whether or not It is time to put an end to the everincreasing spread of subsidies from the Federal Government or nonneedy Individuals. Why should the Government of the United States pay for those who can afford to pay for their own school lunches? To a greater and greater extent the citizens of this country understand that we are taking money out of their wallets through taxation. charging administrative costs In doing so. and then offering a portion of It back to those same people as subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 5 percent of the schools which are members of this program may drop out from the program If these proposals are adopted. The Department of Agriculture. on the other hand. states that this is an unduly high estimate. even an estimate of 5 to 10 percent. It simply cannot be stated with precise accuracy as to what that result would be. but one would expect that schools dropping out of the program would be those which are impacted most by It. that Is to say. those schools with the largest p~ercentage of whose students can efford to pay for lunches but are. nevertheless. having them subsidized at the present time. It also assumes. Incidentally. If a Student must pay the full cost of a school lunch. even with the builtin subsidies of using a school cafeteria which Is not paying taxes. that they will go elsewhere. they will go to McDonalds or they will pack their own lunches or the like. It seems to me a highly dubious assumption to the extent that school lunches are in fact nutritious. and they are. and are served well--and In most places they areso It Is very doubtful that this will. in fact. be the result. As a consequence. the issue with which we are dealing here is not the needy child. The Issue Is not the child who will not otherwise be able to get A hot lunch because that childs parents cannot support it. The question is whether or not we are willing to continue at -the expense of creating and continuing overwhelming deficits and a high rate of inflation the practice of a very substantial subsidy for meals for people whose families do not need such subsidies. One final point. of course. Is the fact that this is In no respects other than the form of the amendment simply a shift of costs or requirements from one function to another. This new function 920 Is certainly being kicked around on the floor of the Senate during the course of this debate. This is a pure and simple addon. To say wve are going to find this amount of money In unspecified savings without being willing to state what In value we are willing to give up In connection with the return of these hundreds of millions of dollars Is simply to say we will add that much to the deficit. that much more in the way of pressure to Inflation. that much more weight against economic recovery in this Nation. The argument had some very real legitimacy during the course of the debate on the reconciliation process. The $300 million restoration at that point. was merely an attempt to return a subsidy to people who did not need one. I reserve the remainder of my time.
970035621,"Mr. President. the Council on Environmental Quality was established in 1969 by the National Environmental Policy Act. The Council. established within the Executive Office of the President. was to be comprised of members who would ""be conscious of and responsive to the scientific. economic. social esthetic. and cultural needs and interests of the Nation."" and who would ""formulate and recommend national policies to promote the improvement of the quality of the environment."" The Councils performance has been good in the decade following its creation. The Council has. in the past. taken a leading role in the development of national environmental policy. Ocean oil pollution. water resources. and solar energy are but a few areas where the Council has participated in the administrations policy development. The Council has provided leadership and a forum for national discussion In such important areas as toxic substances. agricultural lands. global resources. the export of hazardous substances. and domestic housing. and watersewer problems. The Council has provided an independent policy point of view with respect to the Nations environment which could not be articulated by any of the agencies of our Federal system which have control over particular programs or properties. the operation of which affect our national environment. The Council has assisted other Federal departments in evaluating the environmental effectiveness of their existing programs. has reviewed Federal agency predicting of environmental changes. and had promoted the advanced knowledge of the effects of technology on the environment. Most importantly. the Council has prepared the Presidents environmental quality report. required by the National Environmental Policy Act to be provided annually to Congress. In the past. the Councils staff has compiled uptodate technical information and its own professional advice on environmental issues for the Congress. In fiscal year 1980. the project consumed approximately $0.5 million In staff time. materials and production costs. The Councils total fiscal year 1980 budget was $3.108.000. The Presidents budget proposal for the Council on Environmental Quality was $1.044.000. I do not feel that the Council can carry out the rather wide range of responsibility with which it is charged with only $1 million. I am doubtful that the Council can effectively prepare the environmental Quality report on that short budget. let alone continue to make the significant contribution.to the development of environmental policy in this Nation that the Council has made in the past. It was with this in mind that the Environment Committee reported out the bill reauthorizing $1.544.000 for the Council on Environmental Quality. I am aware. as is the majority of the Senate. of the importance of maintaining the budget parameters which the administration has proposed. The Committee on Environment *and Public Works has. therefore. reported out several bills which. taken together. realize the administrations proposals. Note that S. 1211. authorizing appropriations to the Environmental Protection Agency for operation under the Toxic Substances Control Act proposes reduced appropriation level so as to compensate for the increase proposed by this bill. Mr. President. at this time when fiscal austerity is much with us. we must. nevertheless. continue to practice environmental policy thinking. The Congress earlier instructed the Council on Environmental Quality to ""formulate and recommend national policies to promote the improvement of the quality of the environment."" In order to accomplish that same end. I encourage the Senates support of S. 1210. The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading. read the third time. and passed. as follows: S. 1210 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That section 205 of the Environmental Quality Improve. ment Act of 1970 (40 U.S.C. 4374) is amended by striking out subsections (a) and (b) and Inserting in lieu thereof the following: ""(a) $1.544.000 for the fiscal year ending"
970100253,Mr. President. I recently received a letter from a constituent. Mr. Earl N. Legge. of Lynnwood. Wash.. which illiustrates some of the frustrations felt by many retired persons throughout the United States with federally funded retirement benefits. While he labors under a number of misapprehensions. these are misapprehensions which are widely shared throughout the United States. I will read the letter. as an illustration of some of the problems with which Congress and the administration must deal during the course of the next year or so: I am writing to you to protest the taking away of the cost of living Increases for federal employees. The main reason Is that we pay our hard earned money Into the retirement fund for years. pay Income tax on It. receive no Interest on It and for the first two or thrce years of retiremnent we are paid our own money. The government uses that money. or Is borrowing It without Interest. andi when we retire we dont get a living from retirement pay. I was forced to take a disability retirement because of a stroke The same thing with social security. I paid Into for years and when I tried to draw It. I was turned down because I didnt have enough quarters paid In after a certain date To me that Is stealing from the peoplefraud. If ali retired federal employees had put the same amount of money In a saving4 account and left It there. with compounded Interest. the money would have doubled. So. between. social Security and federa: retirement. I figure that the U.S. Govern. ment owes me several thousaaid dollars.I have been thinking of getting a big bunch 01 federal retirees together and have a clasi action suit to recover the money owed us Because of the low retirement pay I receive. I have had to sell the home that I had when I retired. give up my activities In organizations. live In poverty. as compared to when I was working for the stinking Post Offlice. and deny myself a lot of pleasures. I feel that working for the Post OMie Is hazardous to your health because a lot of my friends and fellow Post office employees have suffered heart attacks. stiokes and nervous breakdowns because of pressure while workIng there. Working conditions should be Investigated. The government can find the money to waste $222.000 on a study. but cant take care of Its retired federal employees who have become disabled and also the veterans too. I challenge you to spend a day with me and see what I went from. to what and where I am now. I just went through bankruptcy a short time ago because I couldnt pay my bills. There are enough of us. veterans. retire id federal employees that if we banded together. we could put most of Congress. the President and Vice President In the unemployment lines. In other words. fire. you. I know one way to cut the cost of government. but you wouldnt go for It because It would hurt you and that Is to cut out wages and benefits of the President. Vice President. Cabinet Offlicers. Congressmen. and Senators In half or the same amount of Inflation. I would like to have what I have paid Into social security plus compounded Interest at todays Intereat rates paid to me In one lump sum. If you have the guts to. I would like to see you read this Into the Congressional Record and send me the copy of the Congressional Record that It appears In because I cant afford to buy a Congressional Record. Sincerely. EARL N. Lzos.
970140757,I am very close to finishing. The only restriction contained in this amendment is the restriction against classifying by race the schoolchildren of the United States who. by definition. are guilty of no action of racial segregation whatsoever. It is precisely the promise of Brown against Board of Education which this amendment is designed to implement. It is precisely the high ground in this debate which it is the design of this amendment to take by recognizing in every schoolchild in the United States the right to a racially neutral school assignment. I must say very bluntly that I found it very difficult. extremely difficult. to vote for the JohnstonHelms amendment because it did not deal with this as a matter of principle. I did so only because it provided the vehicle to discuss this amendment which. for the first time. does deal with the matter as a question of principle. I feel quite firmly. and I state this due to my own experience before becoming a Member of the Senate. that the chances that this approach will be validated by the Supreme Court. because it is consistent with the congressional findings Included in the amendment and because it does recognize a right to have racially neutral treatment of Individual school students. are greater than the chances that the JohnstonHelms amendment will be validated by the Court. I believe we are being led down a blind alley which Is likely to meet a rebuff on the part of the churts of the United States. and unlikely to solve the very problem against which it is directed even if it is validated. I believe that sooner or later this body and the Congress are going to have to make that fundamental value determination as to whether or not they think that schoolchildren can appropriately be assigned to public schools simply on the basis of their race. that they can be treated as the pawns of a sociological experiment rather than have the Congress of the United States vindicate their rights to the equal protection of the laws. As I said. I am disappointed. although I understand the tactical reasons for the change of view on the part of my two distinguished colleagues from Louisiana and North Carolina. I. nevertheless. ask each of those persons who has ever made a speech stating that schoolchildren should be treated without regard to race in their school assignments to consider very carefully their vote on the first single instance in which they have been able to vote on that principle. clean and unlimited by attacks of jurisdiction of the courts of the United States or the Department of Justice.
970141585,Mr. President. S. 1204. the Quiet Communities Act. formerly known as the Noise Control Act. is now before the Senate. S. 1204 was acted upon previously by the Senate on July 10. 1981. As it was passed by the Senate. S. 1204 provided not only for reauthorization of the noise control program. but altered the basic structure by which noise. emissions would be regulated. At the present. the Federal Government. through the Environmental Protection Agency. is the sole acting regulatory force with respect to the noise emissions of products. EPAs regulations provide specifications with which manufacturers must comply in designing and producing their products. State governments have the ability. within their discretion. to regulate the use of products within their borders. Some States. including the State which I represent. do regulate the amount of noise that certain products emit. But the States ability to regulate the manufacture of products or the privilege of sale of specific products based on the amount of noise they emit is totally preempted by the EPAs authority. S. 1204. as passed by the Senate last year. removed the Environmental Protection Agencys authority to regulate noise emissions. except with respect to railroads and interstate motor carriers. This approach would open the way for States to regulate noise emissions generally. but reserve regulation of the instruments of interstate commerce to the Federal Government. On December 16. 1981. the House of Representatives amended S. 1204 by substituting its own bill. H.R. 3071. The language of the original House bill is not acceptable. H.R. 3071 retains general regulatory authority over noise emissions for the Federal Government and the Environm6ntal Protection Agency. Because of the unique local character of some Products noise. the authority to regulate some products was suspended however. The preemptive effect of this regulatory structure is unclear at best. leaving the States without a clear. unpreempted authority to regulate at all.e
970150837,Mr. President. I wish to join in supporting the goal underlying S. 868the elimination of the unreasonable and predatory official export credit practices used by our trade competitors unfairly to compete with American exporters for international trade. Our Nations exporting community has waited patiently as the U.S. Government has worked to negotiate an international agreement to end unreasonably subsidized official export financing. To date. however. the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)-the forum in which these negotiations have occurredhas failed to make any significant progress on a comprehensive new arrangement. primarily because the French have proven unwilling to negotiate seriously. In the meantime. the unreasonable and predatory export financing practices of our competitors have continued unabated. We can no longer tolerate this situation. If our major trade competitors are unwilling to negotiate seriously. we must act to insure that American exporters are not unfairly disadvantaged in their efforts to compete in world markets. and to underscore the importance we place on the OECD negotiations. There seems to be widespread agreement that official export credit subsidies tend to distort market forces in trade and investment. and transfer resources from domestic taxpayers to exporters and foreign borrowers. At the same time. however. there can be no doubt about the significant positive impact exporting has on our economy and on employment in this country. If our Nations economy is going to recover from its current recession as we anticipate it will. the exporting sector will have to be able to compete in international markets in order to aid that recovery. I hope that a satisfactory resolution of this export financing problem can be achieved through negotiations. thereby making it unneessary to appropriate the funds authorized by the bill. This will only happen. however. if our trade competitors understand that we are willing to meet their export financing practices if an agreement on this subject is not reached in the near future. For this reason. I join the Senator from Pennsylvania in supporting his Competitive Export Financing Act and in expressing the hope that the Senate will pass it promptly.
970170423,"I yield such time to myself as I may consume. Mr. President. Mr. President. there are some respects in which this has been a difficult amendment with which to deal. primarily because we have not seen a copy of the amendment itself. We understand. however. that what it does is to add approximately $1 billion in fiscal 1982 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 1983 for a substantially unstated. socalled employment program. There is. of course. no proposal for countervailing revenues with which to pay for this proposal. And. a a consequence. I think it might well be entitled ""The Unemployment Amendments of 1982."" Now why do I say that? For this reason: The Senator from Ohio played a significant role in this body during the course of the last half or so of the decade of the 1970s. a time at which programs which fall within the general ambit of this were frequently passed. almost always had whatever effect they had on providing employment after the fact. after it was too late. but which contributed to leave us in an economic situation in which both interest rates and the rate of inflation were significantly higher than they are today. The kind of program which this amendment seeks to revive or resusciLate. assuming that we ever get a more specific description of it than we have at this point. would simply add to all of the pressures. both on interest rates and on rates of inflation. which have already shown themselves so extremely difficult to deal with. It may be appropriate to remind the Senate that at the end of the last administration. after literally dozens of bills of this nature having been passed. the prime interest rate was 20 to 21%/ percent. significantly in excess of the rate which obtains today. although that rate very obviously is far. far too high and contributes overwhelmingly to the economic difficulties which we face. In addition. of course. at the end of 1980. or the beginning of 1981. we were in perhaps the third bout of significant double digit unflation. an inflation whigh at least has been very substantially reduced during the course of the last year and one half. Since no revenues are proposed to pay for this program. it would simply come out of that very. very limited amount of credit available to the private sector at the present time for the creation of jobs. This billion- or billionandahalf dollars. which would go through various levels of governmental administration to projects which presumably would not otherwise be undertaken because they would not otherwise be financially feasible. will come directly out of the small and medium and large business in this country which are already suffering because they cannot find credit at reasonable rates. If we have learned a lesson from the course of the last decade or so. it must. of necessity. be that. The most important goal which we all share here in the Congress of the United States today is the goal. the commitment to lower interest rates across the board in order to provide business opportunities. in order to provide employment opportunities. and in order to provide. purchase opportunities for people who wish to buy on credit. Causing another $2.5 billion to disappear out of that limited market will contribute. once again. to increasing interest rates .rather than to decreasing them. More and more. as we go through this debate. a debate which might much better have been conducted last fall or early this winter rather than in May of 1982. we face the prediction that. if we do not very significantly reduce the 1983 deficit and put ourselves on line toward a balanced budget in the foreseeable future thereafter. we will not have 16.5 percent interest rates later on in this year. we will not have the lower interest rates which are necessary to economic recovery. we will have interest rates which are higher than they are at the present time and which will choke off any incipient economic recovery which might otherwise have taken place. It Is important to note that during the course of the last several economic cycles. In the situation of each one of which the recession has caused a gov. ernmental reaction precisely like that proposed by the Senator from Ohio. the bottom of each recession. from the point of view of unemployment. has been more severe and the recovery has left still more unemployment even at its low point than the low point at the end of the previous recession. The same thing. incidentally. might be said in exactly the opposite sense in connection with the rate of inflation until this time around. With such of the eloquent statement of the Senator from Ohio. I can more than readily agree. Unemployment is the great curse facing the people of the United States at the present time. But the amendment of the Senator from Ohio would not cure unemployment. it would make it worse. It would be a signal that we are going back to the old way of everincreasing deficit spending and of a lack of attention toward problems of either inflation or interest rates. In fact. of course. the Senator from Ohio has ignored the proposition that the budget resolution which is before us now is already considerably more generous in the field of employment and training programs for fiscal year 1983 than was the proposal originally submitted to us by the President. a change which can be accomplished because this budget resolution is more responsible from the point of view of revenues which it seeks than was the original administration budget submitted to us in February. Moreover. the numbers in this budget resolution anticipate the passage through the Labor Committee of a very carefuly worked out. carefully crafted employment and training program which is bipartisan in nature and which will overcome many. one hopes. of the difficulties and inefficiencies which attended upon the various employment and training programs of the decade of the 1970s. In other words. Mr. President. we know what we are getting as a result of the changes which have already been made in this budget. We do not know what kind of program we would get with the success of this amendment. but we do know inevitably and certainly as a result of our experience in the decade of the 1970s and through 1980 that what we would get would be further upward pressure on interest rates. further pressure on the rate of inflation. and. therefore. a continuation and a worsening of the recession and of the unemployment statistics. rather than the kind of improvement which only fiscal responsibility and smaller deficits can possibly create for us."
970206819,Mr. President. as one of the original cosponsors and a strong supporter of S. 881. the Small Business Development Act of 1982. I am pleased today to speak on behalf of this important piece of legislation. S. 881 will provide for a phasedin process by which 1.25 percent of Federal research dollars will be set aside for utilization by small business firms. By bringing this concept to fruition. we are encouraging two outcomes of vital importance to the U.S. economyexpansion of innovative technology and stimulation of the vital small business sector. The United States has long been a leader in advancement of scientific and technological research and development. In recent years. however. international competition has ficreased and we must strive more intensely to maintain the edge needed for an expanding economy. An important part of our commitment as Members of Congress is to pursue policies which help to make this happen. By setting aside this percentage of Federal research dollars for awards to small businesses. we are acting on our faith in the innovative and productive capacity of this segment of our economy. I do not believe we will be disappointed. History indicates that a significant percentage of new technology is the product of entrepreneurs who have the creativity and the flexibility to put untried ideas into practical use. These individuals and their coworkers can be credited with many of the inventions and technological advancements that have improved all of our lives. This administration and this Congress are making important strides toward the goal of using Government to promote rather than deter this innovative activity. I am pleased to be a part of efforts to achieve this goal and I feel S. 881 Is a significant step in the right direction. It is a credit to the efforts of Senator RUDMAN and many of my other colleagues in the Senate and the House that this measure has proceeded to passage in such a timely fashion. President Reagan. who has been a consistent advocate on behalf of measures which encourage growth of the private sector. has expressed his support by signing S. 881 into law. I commend the President and the Members of Congress for moving forward with this legislation. I feel it will make a significant contribuiton to the expansion of technological innovation and the strengthening of our economy.
970224957,Mr. President. the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee has included a provision in the supplemental appropriations bill which will greatly benefit a number of constituents in my State. and for which we are very grateful to him. There is currently a large disparity that exists between wages paid North Pacific Division Corps of Engineers and their counterparts in the Bonneville Power Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation. Legislation passed in the last few years Imposed a limitation on wage increases for Corps of Engineers employees while it has not affected wages of employees of other Federal agencies offering similar positions in the Pacific Northwest. Thus. for example. an employee working at a Corps of Engineers dam project will automatically earn less money than an employee performing the same duties at a Bureau of Reclamation dam project. This unjustified discrepancy has caused a considerable amount of unrest among the workers affected by this wage limitation. particularly at Chief Joseph Dam. a corps project. where the workers are paid less than * their counterparts at Grand Coulee. a Bureau of Reclamation project just 40 miles down the Columbia River from Chief Joseph. Senator HATFIELD has included a provision in H.R. 6863. the supplemental apprQpriations bill. which would rectify this unfair situation. The provision requires that corps employees who are currently paid from Corps of Engineers special power rate schedules be paid wages determined by the Department of Defense Wage Fixing Authority. This change will assure that wages of the corps employees currently paid from the special power rate schedules will be consistent with wages of the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior employees performing similar work in the Pacific Northwest. Senator HATFIELD is to be commended for working to achieve equity in this situation. The people of my State are affected by this provision. and I extend to him our sincere thanks for attempting to terminate this discriminatory wage discrepancy. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

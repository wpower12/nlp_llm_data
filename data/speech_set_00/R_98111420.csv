980030240,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. Each year. many of us in the House of Representatives participate in this special order to honor and remember the victims of the Armenian genocide. In so doing. we attempt. in a small way. to prevent history from repeating itself. We have not been successful. The Armenian massacre was not the first and only mass slaughter of this century. just the first. Since 1915. history will record the death of millions of persons in China. Russia. Germany. Cambodia. and Uganda. There are many reasons for these unspeakable crimes. but a major one. no doubt. is the desire of the Individual to conform. to be just like them. In a recent interview in the World Press Review. playwright/author Eugene Ionesco said: The supreme trick of mass insanity is that it persuades you that the only abnormal person is the one who refuses to join in the madness of others. the one who tries vainly to resist. In the prolonged massacre of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks. there were too few uncommon Turks. too few individuals to stand against the tide of mass insanity and mass murder. too few men willing to be different. In Nazi Germany. there were not enough uncommon men to stop the Holocaust. and in the Soviet Union under Stalin. there were too few uncommon men to stop the programs and purges. ""We will never understand totalitarianism if we do not understand that people rarely have the strength to be uncommon."" said Ionesco. It would also be correct to say that we will never understand genocide if we do not understand that people rarely have the strength to be different when confronted with mass sameness. If we were to study the causes of genocide. I think we would find that before the actual act of slaughter. great and continous pressures were being brought to bear on the people to conform. to toe the official line. to support the final solution. to solve the Armenian question. All individuals are pressured in some way to conform to some act or deed or thought. Surely each of us who are Members of Congress feel the great and continuous pressure to support party policy. or administration policy. or the demands of constituents. Surely each of us understands the strength it takes to be uncommon. It should be clear then to Members of this body that we must make a special effort to be tolerant of difference. We must not be punitive toward those who act in an uncommon manner. Had the Ottoman Turks been tolerant of difference. there would not have been an Armenian genocide. Had the Nazis been tolerant of others. there would not have been a Holocaust. The great strength of this country has come from its individuals and the Nations desire to protect and respect the feelings and opinions of the individual. the ultimate minority. In such an environment. mass slaughter is unthinkable. It only becomes possible in an environment of forced commonality and coerced conformity. If we do nothin else today. let us strive for greater tolerance of difference. let us try harder to understand those who are uncommon. let us be perceptive enough to recognize the dangers inherent in a large group of people who march to the same drummer. let us be wise enough to smile at the solitary marcher.*"

980160215,I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I think one thing that is also very important for us. there are some of our good friends. deeply religious individuals. who are concerned that prayers in public schools might in some way violate some of their rights as a denomination. or establish a pattemn. I would say this: A constitutional amendment is not going to set up the rules or the regulations under which any kind of prayer could take place in schools. It is g to be up to the school systems and to the States to regulate that activity. as they did for nearly 200 years without any severe wrong being done anywhere. There is going to be no desire on the part of anyone that a particular religious faith. or any one denomination. be dominant. The idea is that all should have a right to pray and to worship wherever they might be and that every kind of activity that Is legal should be able to be partaken in the public schools. They should not be given a different standard that is lesser than that which we have for our adults. I wanted to point out one thing also. while I still have a few minutes of my time. I view changes in our Constitution with great concern. I feel compelled. however. to speak out for this amendment. because in spite of evidence that those who founded this country sought Gods help in the framing of our Constitution and of the many instances in our history where our leaders sought His guidance to find moments of crisis turned into moments of victory. prayer Is now prohibited in public school buildings. the very place where our young people. our leaders of tomorrow. are taught to think and to reason. Under present interpretation of the law. no schoolday may be opened or -closed with prayer. no public meeting held at the school building may be opened or closed with prayer. and there may not be any public reading of the Bible. On the other hand. every other subject may be freely discussed. There is no prohibition in any other area. This is a situUSE iil1 *tton Which I find most unfair and mostiharmful to our youiig people and to our Nation. I could never support any effort to require prayer in public schools. but I strongly feel that we must return to permitting prayer in public schools. It seems to me that this privilege ought to be a fundamental right of every American citizen in public schools and elsewhere. I hope that we will be allowed to vote on this very important amendment on the floor of the Congress and that the American people will have a right to their expressions through our elected Representatives to have their way and to have the kind of a country and the kind of a program for our young people that they feel Is necessary. and that a ruling from the Court. after 180 years. shall not be allowed to destroy this right. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
980185594,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the Joint Research and Development Act of 1984 . This measure is analogous to. and patterned after title II of the National Productivity and Innovation Act -legislation which I introduced last year on behalf of the administration. Like that bill. H.R. 5041 makes it clear that research and development joint ventures are judged under the rule of reason standard in antitrust law. Further. the measure limits the potential damages against a research and development joint venture to actual damages. plus interest. and attorneys fees. The elimination of potential treble damage liability. along with the reinforcement of congressional intent on the applicability of the rule of reason test to these joint ventures is significant. It will serve to remove the clouds of deterrence and doubt that currently hover over these types of cooperative activities. discouraging their very formation. The overriding purpose of H.R. 5041 and its legislative predecessors. is to encourage American companies to compete more effectively in the international marketplace. It is a refinement in the antitrust laws. modifying the disproportionate incentives currently ayailable to private litigants who may seek to undermine the viability of particular joint ventures. American businesses should be able to enter into legitimate cooperative arrangements to pursue scientific and technological investigation. without an undue fear of costly litigation and potential treble damage judgments. At the same time. H.R. 5041 does not alter the current law as to any production and marketing by a joint venture. Once a discovery is jointly arrived at. the participants may seek patent protection and license the results of their investigation. But they receive no additional antitrust protection with respect to marketing or production activities. The line is a clear and fair one to draw. H.R. 5041 represents compromise and cooperation on the part of the members of two committees of this Housethe Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Science and Technology. The Reagan administration. particularly through the efforts of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice. has been of great assistance in formulating and refining the provisions of this important legislation. I understand that the Judiciary Committee in the other body has processed similar legislation and favorable floor action is likely there in the near future. At times. this legislation has been characterized by some as a high tech bill. While this is true in part. it also should be emphasized that the benefits of this new statute will be available to all types of American businesssteel and automobiles as well as electronics. pharmaceutical companies as well as computer firms. This is needed legislation. developed in a truly bipartisan manner. It deserves the favorable support of this House.
980187252,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support. of H.R. 4275. a bill that will provide authorization to increase the hydroelectric power capacity at Hoover Dam. title II. H.R. 4275. approved unanimously in the Interior Committee in March 1984. is important to California. as well as other Western States. in that this bill reauthorizes the allocation of electric power from Hoover Dam. a large part of which now flows to California. This reauthorization is necessary since the original 50year contracts signed for Hoover power in 1937 will expire in 1987. The bill will renew these contracts for the next 30 years. well in advance of the deadline. so as to permit the immediate modernization and upgrading of the existing generators at Hoover Dam. This is good. sound legislation. meriting support for many reasons: This measure would make possible an increase in the generating capacity of the Hoover powerplant by about onethird. The existing output from Hoover Dam is about 1.450 megawatts. The upgrading of the existing generators will increase the total power output from Hoover by approximately 500 megawatts. This upgrading portion should be funded by upfront cost sharing from all Hoover allottees. The additional * power from the upgrading will be made available to the States of Arizona and Nevada. and certain California municipalities not now having Hoover allocations. Allocations of existing Hoover power to California entities. however. will remain approximately the same after 1987. This increase in capacity. in turn. makes possible the settlement of an existing lawsuit. brought by Arizona and Nevada against the United States and the California power contractors. Should the bill become law. the litigation that Nevada and Arizona initiated in 1982 to enjoin renewal of the Callfornia contracts can be dismissed. As this controversy will be settled. if this bill is enacted. it is not necessary to describe it in detail. Stffice it to say that it arose from conflicting interpretations of provisions of the Boulder Canyon Project Act controlling the disposition of power after expiration of the original contracts in 1987. Without this bill. there is every prospect of another long drawn out lawsuit. The last Colorado River suit took 10 years to reach a decision. But the parties have agreed to settle. The Departments of Energy and Interior have given their blessing to the settlement. and this bill carries it out. As in most settlements. no one gets all that he wanted. The present contractors are to receive renewal of their contracts for 30 years. but for somewhat less quantities of power in the past. Arizona and Nevada will get most of the increase in capacity of the powerplant. but a substantial quantity is reserved for smaller publicly owned power systems in California. H.R. 4275 would authorize ""uprating""-increasingthe generating capacity of the Hoover powerplants by about onethird through the modernization of the existing generatora. In its present form. the bill would also remedy the very serious objections of Los Angeles. Pasadena. Glendale. and Burbank to the original proposal of the Department of Energy. The bill would allocate to Arizona and Nevada about 75 percent of the capacity added by ""uprating."" The Governments original investment in Hoover Dam. made 50 years ago. Is being repaid. on time. with interest. Its new investment in the enlargement of the capacity of the Hoover powerplant will be either paid for in advance by those who are to receive power. or its repayment will be assured by contracts made in advance of construction if Congress decides to proceed by way of appropriations. Federal electric power should be sold at the lowest cost consistent with sound business principles and the public interest. This principle is enshrined in all Federal power legislation since the 1944 Flood Control Act. Thus. power can be sold at rates which will keep the Government whole. and. in addition. will provide funds for desalting and improving the quality of the Colorado Rivers water. As existing contracts are to be substantially renewed. some 12 million people. in the three States. will continue to receive the benefits - of Hoover power. Early enactment of H.R. 4275 Is in the national interest in every respect. I urge my colleagues to vote for this essential piece oflegislation."
980187338,Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise In opposition to this amendment. The people of Callfornia. Arizona. and Nevada and many areas of the West have very serious power and water problems that are not present In many parts of the country. This legislation was designed after many months of negotiations between the water and power leaders of the Western States trying to work out many of their mutual problems with each other. Arizona and Nevada desired more power from Hoover Dam than they had been getting in the past. It was necessary to work out something so that they could get that. which their tremendous growth has entitled them to and which they need. This amendment really would destroy that agreement that has been prepared. I know many of my friends from the San Francisco area feel that they are not involved. that their interests are not involved by this legislation. But they are. Because if you raise the price of electric power at Hoover Dam. as this amendment would do. you are going to make the cost of pumping the water from the Colorado River to the Los Angeles and San Diego areas and other places extremely expensive. and it will be cheaper for southern California then to get their water through the aqueduct from northern California. The people from northern California will be very definitely affected. They have been trying to get southern California to buy their water from the Colorado River and to get it from that source. But to force the price up beyond the price of northern California water. which this amendment would do. will force us to be in competition with them and to depend upon northern California for a larger share of water than we are now getting. I do not think that will be beneficial to California or any part of it. And I hope that the Members of the House will realize that this is specifically a Western problem. We try to help other parts of the State with their problems. But. to single out Hoover Dam as the only area where we are going to violate the longtime established principle for the sale of electric power and to charge what the market will bear. when that is contrary to all of the principles we have ever followed with federally produced power. would be a mistake. it would be unfair and It would be harmful to the San Francisco area as well as to the rest of the State of California.
980250772,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 6071. the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984. This measure is the appropriate response to the growing phenomenon of trademark counterfeiting in this country and around the world. The counterfeiting of U.S. products injures the economy and safety in the United States. More often than not we see examples where American companies lose business and their reputations are harmed by fake. inferior goods. By the same token. American Jobs are lost. Even more serious. American consumers are injured and in some cases killed by counterfeit products. The proliferation of counterfeit goods has gone from luxury items to necessity goods such as soap and automobile parts. As the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Courts. which has Jurisdiction over intellectual property issues. I am cognizant of the growing importance of these special I 9256 property rights. We must be especially protective of these trademarks as our economy continues its evolution into the information age. A trademark is a form of intellectual property. the owner of a trademark has a property right which he is entitied to protect from use by others. The trademark has no value in and of itself. but must be used in conjunction with other goods for sale. There are two purposes of a trademark: To encourage and reward superior skill. quality. and enterprise and to avoid consumer confusion by allowing customers to identify the goods they purchase. The goals of the Lanham Act cannot be achieved unless Federal law contains the means by which this property can be protected. The Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 provides the means for the effective punishment and deterrence for the counterfeiting of trademark goods. This measure punishes the counterfeiting activities of persons who act with dishonest intent and does not impact upon the innocent retailer. For these reasons. I join in the support of H.R. 6071.o a Mr. FISH. Mr. Speaker. the bill before us today. H.R. 6071. represents a recognition by the Committee on the Judiciary and this body. that trademarks are an important property right that must be protected. American business. labor. and consumers are all negatively affected by the loss to the American economy that results from trademark counterfeiting. The Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 will for the first time make counterfeiting a crime. In addition. H.R. 6071 improves the remedies available to trademark registrants who protect their marks in civil court under the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq. The first of these remedies requires treble damages unless extenuating circumstances indicate to the judge that treble damages would be inappropriate. Although Judges have the ability to grant treble damages under existing law. they have rarely done so. This requirement is an indication of congressional intent that this most serious type of trademark infringement should. as a matter of course. receive the most stringent punishment. The second private relief measure codifies a practice now developing on a case law basisthe ex parte relief. This private seizure remedy Is strictly limited to cases in which the trademark counterfeiter would ignore lesser intrusive court orders and would destroy or hide the counterfeit merchandise rather than cooperate with the judicial system. In this way. the ability to remove the profit from this crime is achieved in a fashion which does not intrude upon the business of the honest merchant. These private remedies are the most effective method of enforcing this property right. However. this adminis. tration has made a commitment to better address the assault of counterfelt goods. According to the testimony I of Conunissioner von Raab of the U.S. Customs Service before the Subcommittee on Crime. a new initiative called Operation Tripwire was inaugurated on February 15. 1983. This program has resulted in the Customs Fraud Investigations Center in Washington. DC. and regional field enforcement teams throughout the United States. These services will better enable the Customs Service to combat fraud. coordinate cases. and proceed criminally against fraudulent importers. Among the many cases of smuggled counterfeit goods include several shipments of pirated ""E.T."" merchandise with a value of over $425.000 that were seized in Ohio. Criminal prosecution is pending. In the Philadelphia area. 80 counterfeit computers and components for 100 more computers were also recently seized. Other reports include consumers harmed by counterfeit soaps. shampoos. eye drops. and automobile brakes. This activity must be brought to a stop. H.R. 6071 is the appropriate congressional response and I urge its adoption.e"
980251259,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to concur in the remarks of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KASTENMEIEal and the gentleman from New York and indicate my strong support for the extension of the Equal Access to Justice Act. The act provides an important avenue of redress for small businesses and individuals with limited assets when they are forced to litigate against unreasonable Government regulation in order to vindicate their rights. Prior to enactment of the act in 1980. a small businessman subjected to questionable agency regulation would have to assess the costs of contesting the agency action against what wai xt stake. All too often the amount at stake was exceeded by the costs of contesting the agency action. Under this set of circumstances the small businessman was coerced into compliance even though he may have had a strong case and ultimately prevailed on the merits. I think it is significant that there have been a relatively low number of applications for awards filed tider the act during its first 2 years. While the low number of applications may in part be a result of the acts novelty. as well as certain ambiguities in its provisions. I think they also indicate that the act is helping to provide for a more accountable bureaucracy. Moreover. the experience under the act to date. has helped to highlight existing ambiguities and problems that have been encountered with Implementation of the act. H.R. 5479 is designed to address these problems in a manner that will improve the acts effectiveness. The act has wide support from such organisations as the Small Business United. Small Business Legal Defense Committee. Small Business Legislative Council. the National Federation of Independent Business. the Chamber of Commerce. the National Small Business Association. the Amercan Bar Association. and the Alliance for Justice. Accordingly I urge my colleagues to strongly support the passage of H.R. 5479.e a Mr. FISH. Mr. Speaker. I strongly support the enactment of this legislation which would reauthorize the Equal Access to Justice Act and make Important improvements and clarifications in its provisions. When Congress first approved the Equal Access to Justice Act In 1980 (Public Law 98481). it was rightfully hailed as landmark legislation by the small business community. This law makes it clear that when individuals. small businesses. and other small organizations prevail against the United States in an administrative proceeding or in a court action. that they should be reimbursed for their attorneys fees and related legal expenses unless the position of the United States is determined to be ""substantially justified"" or that special circumstances make such an award unjust. So. Congress intended to place small businesses. other small organizations. and individuals on a more equal footing with the Federal Government in both regulatory proceedings and court actions. Specifically. we wanted to give them an option. rather than simply having to ""give in"" in the face of costly litigation with the Federal Government. We also wanted Federal departments and agencies to give careful consideration to the real merits of their case before pursuing an administrative enforcement action or a court proceeding. If individuals or small businesses are victims of careless. unreasonable. or unfair governmental Septembor 11. 1984 action. they should not be forced to merely capitulate or to bear the cost of their successful defense. I.R. 5479 would permanently authorize the Equal Access to Justice Act. Originally. the statute provided for a 3year trial period. from October 1. 1981 to September 30. 1984. Experence under the EAJA has proven to be. on balance. successful and its Implementation has been far less expensive than its critics originally estimated. During the first 2 fiscal years of its operation fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983). only 72 awards were made. totaling approximately $2.5 million. Sixtyfour of these awards were in court proceedings and eight of these awards were in administrative proceedings. The amount of these awards is far less than the $100 million annual estimate by the Congressional Budget Office when the EAJA was enacted in 1981. It should be emphasized that the updated cost estimate done by the CBO for H.R. 5479 Is corsiderably less than its initii estimate-$7 million per year. H.R. 5479 also makes important plarifications and additions to the language of the statute. First. this legislation makes it clear that the ""position of the agency"" z.nd ""position of the United States"" in the Equal Access to Justice Act means not only the formal position taken in litigation but also includes those actions or omissions by the agency that led to the adversary adjudication or court proceeding in the first place. Second. this measure extends EAJA coverage to proceedings before agency boards of contract appeals under the Centract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. if 601613). Also. this measure gives the United States. for the first time. the right to appeal a fee determination by an administrative law judge. At the current time. only a nongovernmental party can appeal fee awards under this statute. H.R. 5479 also includes the language of amendment which I offered in the full Judiciary Committee to expand the definition of eligible ""party"" under this statute. As originally enacted. the definition of party contained the words ""corporation"" and ""organization"". The issue as to whether or not units or local government were eligible to be reimbursed for attorneys fees and court costs was left ambiguous. The unfortunate result has been that. for the most part. smaller governmental bodies have not been considered to be eligible parties under the act. In my estimation. the Equal Access to Justice Act should assist any small organization. whether private or governmental. that is havolved in a regulatory or litigation dispute with the United States and where the position of the United States is determined to be not ""substantially justified."" Units of local government are frequently involved in adjudications or litigation regarding grant eligibility and grant reductions under a variety of Federal assistance programs. Smaller governmental entities face the same cost deterrents and other disadvantages that small businesses do in such proceedings. They should be eligible for reimbursement for their fees and expenses where appropriate. I was most gratified when my amendment was adopted by the full Committee. This extension of the Equal Access to Justice Act has received broad support from such groups as the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. the National Federation of Independent Business. the American Bar Association. the National Small Business Association. the Administrative Conference of the United States. and the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. In summary. this legislation permanently codifies a remedial statute that has proven that it can work well and. in addition. makes numerous clarifications in the langauge of the law to further assure fairness to both sides. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 5479.0"
980258775,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I would just like to concur in the remarks of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts. Civil Liberties. and the Administration of Justice. and indicate my support for H.R. 6163. the Federal District Court Organization Act of 1984. H.R. 6163 is an omnibus proposal which has the support of the U.S. Department of Justice. the Administrative Office of II 9996 U.S. Courts. and the congressional del. egations involved. The purpose of the proposed legislation is to realign the boundaries of divisions within three judical districts. to statutorily create an additional place of holding court in four judicial districts. and to change the place of holding court in one judicial district. As a result of these changes. H.R. 6163 will help keep the Federal judicial system up to date with demographic. economic. and societal changes in several of its districts. I think it is important to note that proposals authorizing new places of holding court or making changes in the organizational or geographical configuration of individual judicial districts are carefully reviewed by both the Judicial Conference of the United States and the U.S. Department of Justice. It is the position of the Judicial Conference that: "" * * I changes in the geographical configuration and organization of existing federal judicial districts should be enacted only after a showing of strong and compelling need."" That is as it should be. Likewise. the Department of Justice consults with the U.S. attorneys offices in the affected districts. who are able to assess local needs and conditions. The Department of Justice also considers the fiscal impact of the proposals. including the cost of obtaining the necessary office space. and per diem. and travel costs for court personnel. On the issue of the costs of H.R. 6163. the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that no significant cost to the Federal Government. or to State. or local governments would result from enactment of the bill. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 6163."
980263768,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I support enactment of S. 1132. I commend the chairmen of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Power for responding to the concerns which precipitated the introduction of this legislation. S. 1132. as amended by the Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Power. will resolve many of the licensing problems hindering the development of hydroelectric power at Federal dams. Mr. Speaker. hydroelectric power is a critically important national resourceand the development of hydroelectric power at existing Federal dams is an untapped resource which our Nation cannot afford to ignore. A study recently concluded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers examined 516 Federal dams. Of this total. almost 350 are not being used for the generation of hydroelectric power. These dams have a potential capacity of 13.500 megawatts. with a - production potential for 25 billion kilowatts of electricity annually. This. would be the equivalent of 40 million barrels of oil each year. Yet many wouldbe developers have expressed concerns over the complexity of the licensing process. These concerns were exacerbated last summer when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed a rule which would have further aggravated the complexity of the licensing process. The rule would have relied on a generic. complicated formula for calculating the annual charge assessed for the use of Federal dams. There was a consensus that the rule would likely discourage hydroelectric development and cause consumer prices to unreasonably increase. For these reasons. I joined a bipartisan group of our colleagues last summer and cosponsored the companion measure to 8. 1132. H.R. 3660. H.R. 3660 would have set a fixed annual fee for the nonfederal use of Federal dams for the production of hydroelectric power. Last May. FERC issued a final rule which appears to have responded to many of the criticisms levied against the rule FERC proposed last summer. and which abandoned the complex. generic formula in favor of a fixed annual charge. In our hearings in June. however. several witnesses testified that Federal legislation is still needed to promote the development of hydroelectric power. Many of the wit* nesses expressed reservations as to the likelihood that the new FERC rule will remain in effect for a substantial period. Legislation is also apparently necessary to resolve jurisdictional uncertainty between FERC and the Department of Interior. and to force FERC to honor certain contractual agreements. The legislation before us today responds to these concerns. FERC will be the only agency authorized to impose annual fees. FERC will be required to honor the U.S. Governments existing contractual obligations to certain Irrigation districts. S. 1132 also incorporates the graduated fixed fee embodied in the final FERC rule. This will set a limit on the annual fee and peg the fee to the specific characteristics and value of each hydroelectric project. It will result in an annual charge that is reasonable. recompenses the Government approximately $12 million annually. and will not unreasonably increase the price of hydropower. Most importantly. codifying the fee structure will provide the simplicity -and certainty necessary to promote the development of hydroelectric power. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Thank you.

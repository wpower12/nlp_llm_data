980009040,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I also am pleased to rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey . which addresses one of the main problems I have with this bill. As a matter of principle and a matter of equity. the requested deferral of $229 million in contract authority. authorized to be apportioned by formula for transit capital in fiscal year 1983 should be rejected. Any measure which could conceivably be called a jobs bill should do that at minimum. It seems a little odd to come to the floor with a measure which appropriates general funds for the creation of Jobs. and to ignore the fact that obligations can be increased without further appropriations by insisting that the full $779 million in transit capital authorized by the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 be made available for obligation. The public transportation account in the highway trust fund. supported by the earmarked 1 cent of the 5cent gas tax increase just enacted into law. assures that the full amount can be obligated without adding to the deficit. If this deferral is rejected. the total amount of transit capital made available by formula to Arkansas will be increased by $512.000. from $1.256.000 to $1.768.000. I ask unanimous consent that a breakdown of those figures by system or category be included in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. I also support the other element of the gentlemans amendment. namely. the appropriation of an additional $171 million for transit capital projects allocated at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. This is consistent with my longheld belief that public investment in public works can best serve both the longterm and shortterm needs of the Nation. The administration estimates that each billion dollars of transit capital spending produces 10.240 onsite jobs plus 14.812 offsite jobs. for a total of 25.052. To this you can add roughly another 30.000 induced jobs also in the private sector. I will concede that this does not provide as many jobs per amount of investment as programs which simply go for salaries or payments to subsidize individual needs. But the construction programs have a plus in the form of enduring physical facilities whichin the highway and transit areacontribute to economy and efficiency of transportation and the physical environment in which economic activity is carried on. This has been my position as ranking minority member of the Economic Development Subcommittee for several Congresses and now the Aviation Subcommittee. I urge adoption of the amendment.
980033991,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the amendment being offered by the gentleman from New Jersey. the chairman of our Water Resources Subcommittee . The clean lakes program. authorized in section 314 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. has demonstrated and is continuing to demonstrate that the principal causes of our lake pollution problems can be identified. and comprehensive. costeffective solutions can be developed and successfully implemented for most of our lake problems. We must continue this important environmental program. and that is what the gentleman from New Jerseys amendment is designed to accomplish. Mr. Chairman. it might be worthwhile to note a few facts. Approximately 99 percent of our Nations population lives within 50 miles of a publicly owned freshwater lake. Roughly onethird of us live within 5 miles of a lake. These numbers help bring into focus. I believe. how many of us are potentially affected by the need to restore and maintain the quality and environmental value of these important waters. Another important fact concerning this program comes from a recent study evaluating U.S. EPAs clean lakes program. That study showed that every Federal dollar invested in clean lakes projects is returning $8.30 in benefits that could be identified and additional amounts in benefits that are more difficult to quantify. The clean lakes program has truly been an excellent investment of Federal dollars. both in terms of economic and environmental returns on that investment. Third. Mr. Chairman. we have all become more aware of the need to address various aspects of the acid rain pollution problem that is increasingly threatening our environment. The Clean Water Acts clean lakes program is the only program currently in place and operating today which attempts to deal with at least the lake pollution aspect of this problem on an immediate basis. It would be a bad decision. even a foolhardy one. to abandon this program now at a time when our need for it has probably never been greater. Mr. Chairman. in the Public Works Committees views and estimate report to the Budget Committee a few months ago it was pointed out that the committee Is aware of no adequate State substitute for the very costeffective clean lakes grant program. funding for which should be continued in fiscal year 1984. That statement is as true today as it was then and sums up quite well why the amendment being offered this morning should be overwhelmingly supported. I urge adoption of the amendment.
980045332,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. at the proper moment I do plan to yield half of this time to the distinguished gentleman from New York because we have joint jurisdiction over this bill. Mr. LENT serves as ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Commerce. Transportation. and Tourism of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I want to thank my distinguished chairman. the gentleman from California for bringing this bill to the floor and want to associate myself with his remarks. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1707 and urge my colleagues to adopt this important legislation. H.R. 1707 was introduced by the Public Works Committee Leadership at the request of the NTSB and hearings were held recently to examine this legislation in considerable detail. After hearing the testimony presented. I firmly believe that the funding levels contained in H.R. 1707 should be supported by this body. Although the fiscal year 1984 authorization contained in the bill is nearly $3 million higher than the administrations request-$22.6 million versus $19.7 million. I firmly believe that the additional funds will go a long way toward maintaining the highest level of safety throughout our national air transportation system. Although the NTSB is a relatively small agency. most of us are well aware of the important role it performs in protecting the public and appreciate the job it has done recently under some very difficult circumstances. Recently. the Board has been called upon to investigate a series of major air carrier accidents. as well as a fatal subway accident in Washington and an Amtrak fire incident in California. In addition to these more prominent occurrences. the NTSB continued to investigate a large number of other accidents in all of the transportation modes. Special investigations. such as the inquiry into the poststrike air traffic control system also were undertaken. This study. which the Board issued only last week. explored the FAAs efforts to bring the capacity of the air traffic control system up to the levels attained prior to the PATCO strike. While the safety record of the system has been excellent since that time. the Board has made some important recommendations and its report addresses many concerns about whether additional air traffic capacity should be added at this time. I believe studies such as this are invaluable since they provide Congress with an independent and objective assessment of safety conditions in a particular transportation mode. Moreover. I submit that this is but one example of the kind of work which will either be delayed or not performed at all if the Board is not funded at the levels provided for in H.R. 1707. As my colleagues are aware. the NTSBs primary mission is to determine the probable cause of transportation accidents. issue safety recommendations designed to prevent such accidents from recurring and conduct special safety studies and investigations as warranted to assure public safety. The funding levels called for in H.R. 1707 would allow the Board to be staffed at 347 positions in fiscal year 1984which is still a long way from its previous high level of 401. This increase in funds would allow the NTSB to add key investigatory positions and would also permit the Board to increase its emphasis on the study of human factors and the role they play in all kinds of transportation accidents. The funding levels for fiscal year 1985 and 1986-$24.5 million and $26.1 million. respectively contemplate the same staffing levels and responsibilities as that which would be provided in fiscal year 1984. Mr. Speaker. the NTSB is an agency with a small budget but one which has the capability to save countless lives and avert millions of dollars in property damage if it is only given the resources necessary to do its job. I. believe H.R. 1707 accomplishes this and for the foregoing reasons. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from New York .
980101171,Mr. Speaker. as a strong supporter of the migrant student record transfer system (M8RTS) in Little Rock. Ark.. I am pleased that the appropriations bill approved by the House last Thursday for LaborHHSEducation Includes $255.744.000 for the migrant education program. This appropriation. which is the same as the fiscal year 1983 level. includes funds for the MSRTS. which maintains health and academic records on each migrant student and transfers them with the child as he moves from school district to school district. I have witnessed the maturation of this system of Inter- and intraState coordination. and recognize its great value to the migrant community. The appropriations measure also Includes $7.500.000 for the high school equivalency program (HEP) and the college assistance migrant program (CAMP). which enable students from poor families of migratory and seasonal farm workers to obtain high school diplomas rind subsequently to be placed in steady employment or into postsecondary education. I think my colleagues will agree that considering the legislative history of the program. the preponderance of evidence overwhelmingly supports the position that Federal categorical funding is required if the needs of migrant children are to be met adequately. As you will recall. States. given their own priorities and concerns. have never responded to this mobile population. Prior to Public Law 89750. in 1966 only three States had appropriated any funds for migrant education. The migrant program differs from other educational programs in that the highly mobile child is often the concern of many school districts in more than one State. Therefore. the success and continuity of the migrant childs education depends largely on the leadership of the Department of Education with the joint cooperation of the States. Under Public Law 89750. for the first time. payments were provided under title I. ESEA to State education agencies to provide and meet the special education and health needs of migrant children between the ages of 5 and 17. In this act. States were required to coordinate with other States in the transmitting of pertinent infomation in repet to school records for migrant education. The national migrant student record transfer system became the eventual result of this provision. Education of migrant children presents unique workload problems for the school districts. These children move frequently from school district to school district for periods which often do not coincide with normal school terms. The lack of educational and health histories prior to MSRTS made grade placement difficult and medical needs unknown. The U.S. Department of Education. with the cooperation of the States. moved swiftly to correct these various Inequities and developed curriculums in reading. math. early childhood. and oral language. They also developed a very extensive health record which provides teachers and administrators immediate access in connection with the placement and provision of health care for migrant children. Since that time. you can find many exemplary demonstration models for coordination. teaching exchange. and Joint curriculum development. through this program. Interagency coordination has become a reality. with the Department of Education working with both the U.S.. Health Department and the Rehabilitative Service In providing muchneeded and complex service to the migrant population. Since the original amendment of 1966. Congress has strengthened this SeDtember 27. 1983 law on several occasions in order to be sure that the total needs of migrants and handicaps were being met. Public Law 90247. signed into effect on January 2. 1968. was the basis of calculation for payment to the States. Again in 1970. Public Law 91230 was signed into effect on April 13. 1970. which required the States receive their money based on the number of migrant children served. Then later. Public Law 93380 was signed into effect on August 21. 1974. which allowed the States to operate the programs for migrant children directly through the local education agencies (LEAs). which was a clear indication even at this late date that some States did not really care about this mobile population of migrant children. The latest amendment to that act was Public Law 95561. dated November 1. 1976. which even went further and strengthened MSRTS and the transferring of the education and health information on migrant children. Prior to 1966. 9 out of 10 children of migrant farmworkers never entered high school and only 1 out of 10 who entered ever graduated. Most migrant children up to that time usually dropped out of school in the fourth or fifth grades. As one can understand. their attendance was erratic due to their traveling. and with the need of the families to have them working in the field. as well as other conditions of the poverty which surrounds them continually. there was a great lack of continuity of curriculum and instruction. Above all. a prevalent negative attitude by the local community. coupled with the migrant students commitment to their families and their poor health and nutrition. certainly detracted from their ability to learn when they did attend school. Since the Federal Government moved so humanely and has continued its efforts to strengthen the migrant program. it has become one of the most effective Federal programs. A large part of the credit for this Is due to the cooperation of the Federal and State authorities. To date. the migrant program currently serves approximately 800.000 migrant children in 49 States plus Puerto Rico. I firmly believe that the migrant program is a model that can be used in the development of many other educational programs. and hope my colleagues will join with me in assuring that this success story is continued..
980130064,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4294. This bill would honor two very distinguished former Members of this body by having VA hospitals named after them. The hospital in Altoona. Pa.. would become the James E. Van Zandt Veterans Administrati3n Medical Center and the hospital in Dublin. Ga.. would become the Carl Vinson Veterans Administration Medical Center. Mr. Speaker. former Congressman Van Zandt is personally known to many of us. His record of service to the Nation In war and peace is a most enviable one. He is a veteran of three wars. rising from an enlisted status In the U.S. Navy in World War I to the rank of rear admiral in the Naval Reserve following his active duty during the Korean conflict. He came to Congress in 1938 and served until 1943 when he resigned to go on active duty in World War II. Following his discharge he was again elected to Congress and served until 1963. Mr. Van Zandt was always a champion of veterans. He was elected three times as national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and is an active member of several other veterans organizations. While in Congress he served on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. the House Armed Services Committee. the Committee on Naval Affairs. and was the ranking member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy during its early days. He is a tireless worker in many fields and is a respected and beloved. veterans leader whose name will add luster to the VA hospital In Altoona. Pa. Mr. Speaker. Carl Vinsons name is legend in this body. He served in Congress longer than anyone else. He was known far and wide as ""Mr. Defense."" Thle United States was In four wars during his tenure here. All during that time. Mr. Vinson was a visionary leader who understood this Nations role in the world. He understood more than most the need for a strong national defense. and he spent a lifetime of service to his country leading defense efforts. The Dublin. Ga.. VA Medical Center will gain increased stature by having his name enshrined upon Its wails. Mr. Speaker. the House Veterans Affairs Committee has very strict rules about recommending that veterans hospitals be named after Individuals. The most cogent rule requires that the Individual be truly distinguished. Jimmy Van Zandt and Carl Vinson meet this test in every way and I therefore urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4294. 1 congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Georgia"
980170417,"Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to rectify the dilemma in which many rural hospitals find themselves under the new diagnosis related groups (DRO) reimbursement plan under the medicare prospective payment system (PPS). Many large and efficient hospitals are being penalized under the DRO system because they are outside the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) which receive a larger reimbursement for health care services from medicare than rural areas. In my own State of Arkansas. hospitals such as St. MaryRogers Memorial in Benton County and De Queen General Hospital in Sevier County both serve their communities with large inpatient care capacity and sophisticated medical facillties which are expensive to operate and maintain. However. a significant disparity exists under the PPS whereby rural hospitals could possibly be reimbursed at. a rate of 25 percent less than the reimbursement for urban hospitals. In the case of St. MaryRogers Memorial. the difference amounts to $576 less per patienta high price to pay for being located only 15 miles from a hospital classified as urban. One unfortunate result of the worthy goal of budget neutrality which was set forth upon the enact.ment of the prospective payment system was to thrust upon rural hospitals much of the burden of achieving a national reduction in hospital costs and protecting the medicare trust fund. However. my bill would strike the rural/urban classification and provide a single prospective payment reimbursement rate for all hospitals. instead of targeting rural hospitals for the greatest reductions. II 2056 I urge my colleagues to Join me in insuring that our Nations rural hospitals. which often serve areas as large as MSAs. and which provide quality care. are not doomed to substandard capabilities or to extinction by somewhat arbitrary classifications. H.R. 5255 A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act with respect to providing for a single prospective payment rate for hospitis located in urban and rural areas Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled That in) paragraph (3) of section 1886(d) of the Soci.

980184931,Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 4616. a bill which has the potential for helping reduce accidental deaths and injuries among young children riding in motor vehicles. It would do this by: First. increasing the authorizations for State and community highway safety programs from $100 million a year to $115 million and $120 million. respectively. for fiscal years 1985 and 1986. (second. requiring States to spend a minimum of 8 percent of these funds on programs to increase proper use of child restraints. and third. giving the Secretary of Transportation the authority to approve State programs as eligible for funding. There 1.s a strong case for this bill. During 1982. the last year for which we have good data. highway accidents took the lives of 633 children through the age of 4 who were occupants of motor vehicles. As to injuries. the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the injurytofatality ratio is roughly 30 or 40 to 1. Childrestraint devices work. -The National Transportation Safety Board has studied the issue and confirmed that contention. Testimony before the Public Works Committee has indicated that 90 percent of the fatalities and twothirds of disabling injuries could be prevented by proper use of childrestraint deviceswith the device properly installed in the vehicle and the child properly secured in the device. Yet theuse of such restraints runs about 40 percent. and it has been estimated that only 12 percent represents proper use. The need. then. is for a program to encourage wider use and correct use. . . This bill can help. and is likely to lead to development of programs nationwide. consisting of madatory use of child restraintsunder State lawan intensive education program for parents and police. enforcement. media efforts. availability of loaner devices to lowincome families. and involvement of a wide range of individuals and organizations. I am encouraged to believe that it will indeed help. It has a lot going for it. including a heightened concern for highway safety in general. the support of a number of groups and organizations. and the fact that at least 44 States have enacted some form of child restraint legislation in recent years. In 1983. this Nation recorded the lowest number of highway fatalities in 20 years. Some 42.500 died on the highways last year. more than 12.000 fewer than in the peak year of 1972. And the death rate in terms of fatalities per .million vehicle miles traveled is at an alltime low. Evidently a number of safety and safetyrelated efforts are paying off. and it is my hope and expectation that with enactment of this bill we will continue the progress of recent years. Mr. Speaker. I have no further requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.
980205140,Mr. Speaker. I would like to place in the REcoRD my views in support of H.R. 5297. the Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984. This legislation would assure the orderly phaseout of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). which is now scheduled to go out of existence at the end of this year in accordance with provisions of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA). I believe that. if adopted. H.R. 5297 will assure that any problems associated with CABs sunset will be minimized and that the transfer of some of the Boards current functions will be accomplished without any adverse effects on the traveling public. As my colleagues are aware. the ADA provided for the transfer of many of the CABs functions on January 1. 1985. Among these responsibilities are the administration of international aviation functions and the small community air service program. both of which are scheduled to transfer to the Department of Transportation. However. the deregulation act did not specifically provide for the transfer of certain other CAB functions relating to domestic air transportation. such as jurisdiction over consumer protection. competitive practices. and fitness of air carriers. Because I believe that the traveling public must continue to receive the same level of protection that it has come to rely upon over the years. H.R. 5297 assures that these important responsibilities will not be eliminated. In addition. it also consolidates within DOT virtually all of the transferring CAB functions. thus avoiding the confusion and inefficiencies which would undoubtedly occur if these responsibilities were dispersed among different Federal agencies. First. the bill would transfer the CABs existing authority to regulate unfair and deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition to the Department of Transportation (DOT). This authority. continued in section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act. has been used by the CAB to adopt consumer protection regulations on denied boarding compensation. baggage liability. notice to passengers about the terms of carriage and protections for charter passengers. In addition. the CAB has recently issued rulemaking proposals relating to airline computer reservations systems used by travel agents. and final rules are expected to be adopted in the near future. The legislation also transfers CABs existing authority in section 404(a) of the Federal Aviation Act to the DOT. This section provides the authority to regulate in other consumerrelated areas and is the basis upon which the Board has issued regulations dealing with smoking aboard aircraft and transportation of handicapped passengers. Second. the bill would transfer CABs authority to determine a carriers fitness to the DOT. Although the domestic fitness function was not specifically transferred by the Airline Deregulation Act. I believe it is important that the thorough inquiry now conducted by the CAB be continued after sunset. With the entry of many new airlines Into the system. it is extremely important that we assure the traveling public that carriers will be adequately prepared to undertake their responsibilities. Accordingly. the legislation would require DOT to perform this function and to continue issuing separate certificates under section 401 of the act. Third. the bill transfers to DOT the CABs authority to approve mergers. interlocks and agreements. as well as the authority to grant antitrust immunity to these transactions in appropriate cases. I believe DOTs expertise in air transportation makes it particularly wellequipped to exercise this authority. For example. sections 408 and 412 specifically require that. in determining whether certain mergers or intercarrier agreements should be approved. the transportation benefits which would be provided must be balanced against the possible anticompetitive effects involved. Because I believe that DOT would be in the best position to evaluate these often competing considerations. the bill transfers these provisions to DOT. Mr. Speaker. this legislation results from numerous hearings which we have conducted on the economic issues associated with airlines deregulation. As a result of this thorough inquiry. I firmly believe that adoption of this bill is essential if we are to have an orderly phaseout and transfer of the CABs functions. While the Boards disappearance will close another chapter in this countrys movement toward a deregulated air transportation system. we cannot overlook the fact that the traveling public and the aviation community will continue to expect that the Federal Government will be able to respond to any problems which may arise. Therefore. we must assure that the authority is in place to carry out these important responsibilities and that they will be administered by an agency with demonstrated expertise in air transportation issues. Mr. Speaker. I am confident that H.R. 5297 accomplishes these objectives and. for these reasons. urge my colleagues to support it.o
980216678,Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to rise today in support of H.R. 3282. the Water Quality Renewal Act of 1984. The history of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. particularly since 1972. has been one of substantial progress in meeting the water quality coals of our Nation. A combination of regulatory and funding mechanisms has led to widespread industrial and municipal construction of wastewater treatment facilities. These efforts. together with other special progams in the law. continue to improve the Nations water quality. The amendments in H.R. 3282 are a result of a great deal of work. especially on the part of our Public Works Committee chairman. the gentleman from New Jersey. Congressman HOWARD. He has striven to assure the strongest environmental bill possible. consistent with realworld needs. The leadership of our committees ranking Republican. the gentleman from Kentucky. Congressman SNYDER. as Well RS that of the Water Resources Subcommittee chairman. Congressman ROE. and his ranking counterpart. Congressman STANGFLAND. has alo been noteworthy. H.R. 3282 continues numerous existing programs and establishes some creative and needed new programs. In summary. the bill provides for. among other things: A 5year reauthorization of existing programs. Revisions of some of the acts compliance deadlines. An expanded program of grants and revolving funds for the construction of sewage treatment plants. A new NonPoint Source Control Program. Authority for administrative penalties. Tenyear national pollutant discharge elimination system ENPDES] permits and partial program delegation to the States. Continued eligibility for combined sewer overflows [CSOs] and collector systems. Required passthrough of 205(j) grants to substate planning organizations. A onequarter of 1 percent setaside for investigation and auditing activities within the Construction Grants Program. and Several sitespecific projects to deal with major problem areas. One of H.R. 3282s most innovative proposals is the bills authorization of a new revolving fund program through which a State will be able to provide financing assistance to its political subdivisions and. upon repayment. be able to use that money again to construct needed pollutioncontrol facilities. These funds can be used for loans. guarantees. interest subsidies. and other nongrant purposes. Under this new authority. many more communities will receive funding for construction of needed wastewater treatnient facilities. Many communities throughout the Nation have waited in vain for Federal funding. being too far down on the States priority list. and this new revolving fund program is designed to help those communities meet the acts 1988 deadline. Mr. Chairman. among its many noteworthy provisions. H.R. 3282 contains two new authorities that should be highlighted. Section 24(c). among other things. directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. to conduct a comprehensive 1year study of Beaver Lake. AR. In order to identify measures to optimize the use and quality of the lakes waters. The provision also directs the Administrator. upon completion of his study. to conduct a demonstration project at Beaver Lake to determine the effectiveness of measures designed to preserve and enhance the quality of the lakes water for current and future users. Section 24(c) Beaver Lake language is designed to protect one of northwest Arkansas most important sources of drinking water. and I am strongly supportive of this provision. A second provision in the bill which is of great importance to me and the people of Arkansas is H.R. 3282s section 25(c). which amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize partial delegation to the States of the acts NPDES Program. This provision is designed to increase individual States NPDES Program implementation activities. particularly those of the States of Arkanzas. Louisiana. New Mexico. Oklahoma. and Texas. It is a provision which I believe will expedite achievement of the acts water quality goals and I compliment the committee for recognizing its importance and including it in the Water Quality Renewal Act of 1984. Mr. Chairman. there are numerous other important water quality provisions in the bill before us today which are deserving of mention but which time will not permit us to discuss in detail. Some of those have been highlighted by the Members who have preceded me and others will be described after I conclude. Allow me. in summary. to indicate my strong support for H.R. 3282 and my desire to see this bill pass quickly and overwhelmingly here in the House.
980241281,Mr. Speaker I rise In support of H.R. 5398legislation relevant to the existing Vietnam era 01 bill and the highly successful Veterans Readjustment Appointment Program. Mr. Speaker. this bill contains several important provisions necessary to the continued success of these programs. H.R. 5398 extends the Veterans Readjustment Appointment Program for 3 additional years. through September 30. 1987. hi~s program. known as the VRA Program. tillows eligible disabled and educationally disadvantaged Vietnam veterans to be appointed to Federal civilian jobs on a noncompetitive basis. After 2 yeais of satisfactory service. the veteran Is generally given a career or careerconditional position within the Federal civilian workforce. Since the establishiment of the VRA In 1970. more than .000 thousand Vietnam era veterw~s have been placed in Federal Jobs. and its 3year extension will guarantee the programs continued ability to assist our Vietnam era veterans. H.R. 5398 also provides for a 15percent Increase in the benefits payable under the G1 bill. effective on January 1. 1985. 1 would like to point out to my colleagues that the most recent 0I bill benefit Increase was approved In 1980. and there have been significant increases In education costs since that time. These benefit increases are necessary and Justified. and I fully support them. It should also be btressed that the funds for these program changes have been Included in the budget. and the administration fully supports them. Finally. Mr. Speaker. the bill before us today extends by 6 months the cutoff date for application and trainIng commencement under the newly established Veterans Jobs Training Program. After several hearings. the Veterans Affairs Committee has concluded that these alterations In the Job Training Program will Improve its administration. and extend the availability of training to a greater number of deserving. unemployed veterans. In conclusion. Mr. Speaker. I would also like to call my colleagues attention to the leadership on these important veterans Issues exhibited by our distinguished committee chairman. my good friend SONNY MONTGOMERY. who has been In the forefront of all our veterans legislation. And finally. we must note the contributions of Education and Training Subcommittee Chairman MARVIN LEATH of Texas and the ranking Republican mnember. my good friend JERRY SOLOMON. of New York. They have both Worked diligently In exercising oversight and improvement of these important veterans proigrams and have played a crucial role in the development of this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I urge passage of H.R. Mr. Speaker. I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from New York . the ranking member of the subcommittee.

970013821,Mr. Speaker. the votes which Members of this body cast today may be among the most important of the entire Congress. I do not think that this is just because of the dollar amounts that have been discussed on both sides of the aisle. rather. it is because of what each Members vote will signify about his or her real commitment to fight inflation by demanding more responsible patterns and levels of Government spendIng. Before being a Member of this august body. I was a faculty member at the Wharton School of Business. Economists now realize that. in microeconomic terms. citizens react on an individual level in response to what their future expectations are in regard to what the economy and what Government will be doing in the months ahead. And that is why what we do today is so terribly important. because I think it shows to the public. or will show. what they may expect with regard to Government spending in the months ahead. Will they expect a true commitment to reduce Federal spending and efficiency in Washington? Or will they continue to get the kind of double talk and double accounting which they have become accustomed to for more than a generation? It may well be impossible to find one among us who did not campaign on a platform calling for improved Federal responsiveness to the real needs of the American people and for greater accountability of the Federal Government. Today we have an opportunity to prove to our constituents that we are serious about these commitments. We all recognize the dramatic plight of the American economy and the need to restrain Government spending. I believe it is incumbent upon us as Members of this Nations highest legislative body to show that we can and that we will impose some sense of fiscal responsibility in the workings of our own house. Let us put our own house in order. The measures to be voted on today offer a choice between a merely symbolic gesture to rein in the spending of these committee budgets or a sincere effort to significantly reduce this spending and turn around what has been an Indefensible pattern of explosive growth and expense. Even in our current economic state. the rate of inflation does not begin to approach the rate at which committee budgets have increased. In just the last 10 years we have seen a shocking sevenfold increase in the amounts allocated for House committees. This is truly a critical time. Our most pressing needs cannot continue to be met without a vastly improved economy. Inflation. which so erodes the security of all Americans and does most harm to those with fewest resources. must be halted. Recent actions in both Houses of Congress prove that there is broad bipartisan support for necessary reductions in the Federal budget. But we must begin at home to implement these needed reductions. Our constituents will surely not be so naive as to believe that House committee functions today actually require 700 percent more money than they used in We will be making many difficult decisions in the weeks to come. Todays decision. though. is not difficult and there is an impressively clear need to respond to the American voters by supporting the motion of my most distinguished colleague from Minnesota. As you all know. this motion will recommit the committee funding resolutions with Instructions to reduce the amounts by 10 percent from last years expenditure. The 52 Republican freshmen. I am proud to say. have already indicated our united support for such action by unanimously approving a resolution calling for such a reduction. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit as the only viable way to demonstrate to the American public that we do not intend to exempt ourselves from the overriding mandate to make all aspects of American government more responsible and accountable to the American people.
970070118,"Mr. Speaker. as Americans. we live In a society free of overt and deliberate governmental repression. It Is difficult for us to understand the hardships experienced by individuals living under totalitarian regimes. We are not tortured. We are not driven from our homes In the middle of the night by security agents. We are not Jailed without trials nor are we charged with crimes that have no legal Justification. Finally. we do not live in a constant state of anxiety for everything we do and say. This lack of freedom. this lack of respect for individual rights is unknown to most Americans. but these cofiditions are a daytoday reality for millions of individuals throughout the world. Two individuals who are particularly familiar with the repressive nature of the totalitarian government are Mykola and Raisa Rudenko. Mykola Rudenko. a founding member of the Ukrainian Helsinki Monitoring Group. and a Nobel Peace Prize nominee. has been Imprisoned in a Mordovian corrective labor colony on charges of ""antiSoviet agitation and propaganda."" His term Is 12 years. Mrs. Rudenko has been missing from her home in Kiev since April 14. It is believed that her disappearance Is being used to pressure or Influence her imprisoned husband. The ""crimes"" allegedly committed by the Rudenkos against the Soviet Union are acts of freedom and conscience. By signing the Helsinki accirds in 1975. the Soviet Union pledged to ""respect ... human rights and fundamental freedoms. including the freedom of thought. conscience. religion or belief."" The Rudenkos and approximately 500 other persons like them have been arrested for merely speaking out In favor of those accords and for documenting where those agreements have been breached. Our thoughts are with the Rudenkos and I urge that Mrs. Rudenkos whereabouts and her condition be disclosed by Soviet officials. Further. I ask that Mykola Rudenkos physical health be revealed. Finally. I urge that the Soviet Union adhere to those agreements outlined in the Helsinki accords. We as Americans. fortunate to live in a society void of systematic repression. cannot accept the unnecessary suffering which countless individuals under totalitarian regimes must endure. We must continue to strive for fulfillment of that. universal desirefreedom.9"
970077957,Mr. Chairman. I rise to offer an amendment to delete $14.910.000 authorized in this bill to the Department of the Navy for the construction of 200 offbase family housing units near the Johnsvllle Naval Air Development Center In Warminster. Pa.. and the Willow Grove Naval Air Station located in Horsham. Pa. The Navy desires to purchase approximately 30 acres of privately owned. industrially zoned land in a suburban community where open space is rapidly diminishing. This initiative. as presently proposed. is inconsistent with community planning. which has. In the past. tried to sensibly coordinate private residential needs and Industrial land usage with the priorities of the Warminster/Horsham Townships. Acquisition of this land. added to the 1.000 acres within Horsham Township already owned by the Federal Government. will result in the removal of onetwvelfth of township property from the tax rolls. In these budgetcutting times. when the Federal Government Is already asking so many sacrifices of local governments. township officials believe that further reductions in their tax base would be detrimental to the area and to their ability to provide funding sources for necessary local services. Additionally. under another program. AICUZ. the Department of the Navy has already begun to purchase private properties totaling 300 acres at the northern and southern ends of the Willow Grove runway which have been determined to be too close to Incoming and outgoing flights. While Horsham residents are well aware of the benefits derived from having the Navy as a neighbor. they are also aware of the penalties which must be paid. Although few air tragedies have occurred in the vicinity of the complex. the community has readily recognized the potential danger and has. for the most part. cooperated with the Department of Navy In this particular land acquisition endeavor. I call this project to my colleagues attention to emphasize the spirit of cooperation my constituents generally display In. their relationship with the Navy. However. this existing housing proposal which is the subject of my amendment threatens to destroy this relationship. I have been actively working with local officials and representatives of the Navy to develop a suitable alternative to the offbase housing plan. The surrounding localities. and in particular the residents of Horsham. many of them veterans. take a tremendous amount of pride in the role they have historically played in our Nations defense readiness. By deleting the funds for this construction and the related encroachment on the local tax base. we will provide the Navy and the community with the necessary time to conduct a thorough review of the avenues open to use to see that a suitable alternative Is developed. one that satisfies the Navys cr1teria without placing an undue burden on the neighboring communities and their residents. Therefore. I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and I thank them for their support.
970082124,Mr. Chairman. I am compelled to broach this unpleasant subject because the sewage disposal plan recently proposed by the District of Columbia may adversely affect my constituents. Just 2 weeks ago. I was abruptly informed by a newspaper reporter that the District of Columbia had entered Into a tentative agreement to transport some 500 tons of bludge every day to GROWS landfill In Falls Township. Pa.-a landfill that is situated In close proximity to the Delaware River. the main source of drinking water for millions of people in the greater Philadelphia area. This is the only operating landfill in the eighth Congressional District of Pennsylvania. This proposal not only raises serious questions environmentally. it also raises questions of fiscal responsibility and threatens the public safety of the people of Pennsylvanias Eighth Congression al District. And beyond that. this hasty proposal ultimately does not provide a meaningful answer to the questions facing the people of the District of Columbia. Mr. Chairman. this proposal is... in my view. a classic example of shortsighted. lastminute decisionmaking. It provides a shortterm solution for the District of Columbia but creates a longterm problem for the people of my District. That problem. with which the District of Columbia Is only too familiar. Is the regrettable fact that there is only so much landfill area to go around. The reason the District of Columbia Is in this curent crisis Is because it has exhausted the landfill sites that had previously been available to It. The Eighth Congresional District does not want to find Itself facing a simitlar situation a few years down the road. Currently. GROWS landfill handles somewhere between 100 and 150 tons of sludge per day from various sources primarily in suburban Philadelphia. The additional influx of sewage from the District of Columbia will tripleor perhaps quadruplethe amount of sludge being depolited into the GROWS landfill. Even the most optomistic projection. however. predicts that the GROWS landfill each day. Estimates vary as to the lifespan of the GROWS landfill will be exhausted within 8 short years. Mr. Chairman. perhaps a few statistics would help place this issue In perspective for my colleagues. The District of Columbia plans to truck 500 tons of sludge each day Into my district. That adds up to over 200.000 tons of sluge over the 15month duration of the proposed contract with GROWS. Shipping 500 tons of sludge on a 175mile oneway trip Is an expensive proposition. Mr. Chairman. It has been estimated that the transportation costs alone over the next 15 months will cost a staggering $25 a tonor some $4.5 milion over the next 15 months. A minimum of 20 to 25 21ton trucks will be required to haul this extraordinary amount of sludge. contributing to the congestion and deterioration of the local roads and highways. Moreover. these wastes will be hauled every day through the cities of Washington. D.C.. Baltimore. Wilmington. and Philadelphiaone of the most heavily populated corridors in the country. Surely a less expensive and hazardous method of disposal can be found. Mr. Chairman. I would like to emphasize that I am not alone in my opposition to this extravagent proposal. In response to the public outcry. the supervisors of Falls Township have sent a telegram to the Department of Environmental Resources of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urging them to deny GROWS landfill permission to implement this plan. and requesting that a public forum be provided. 1. too. have petitioned DER to reject. the GROWS proposal until certain determinations have been made. In response to the objections raised by myself and others. DER has requested that GROWS provide Information on the environmental impact of this proposal. as well as a detailed analysis of the sludge content. Furthermore. DER has urged the District of Columbia -to explore alternative methods of disposal. Mr. Chairman. I sympathize with the plight of the District of Columbia. Yet. I do not believe that running roughshod over the citizens of the Eighth Congressional District provides an equitable solution for the problem of sewage disposal. I believe that the taxpayers of this country should be assured that this Is the most efficient and effective plan available. For this reason. I request a 60day delay In the Implementation of this plan In order to give the orgainizations involved in the proposal time to adequately answer the questions that have been submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to give Pennsylvania time to effectively evaluate those answers and make an informed decision on the soundness of this proposal. My amendment does not preclude the eventual use of these funds or the disposal of this sludge but it provides some assurance to the people of the Eighth Congressional District that they are not the victims of a capricious and hastily conceived scheme. Mr. Chairman. as a freshman Congressman I had hoped to bring Washington closer to my constituencybut truckloads of sewage sludge was not what I had In mind. Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. DixoN) for his cooperation and I thank the rankIng minority member. the gentleman from Pennsylvania .
970136488,"Mr. Speaker. the Internal Revenue Service an1nounced recently that it will no longer -provide tax preparation services for taxpayers. The IRS will. however. continue to offer that service at its CapItol Hill office. 1 I question this new policy and. I deEplore the exception for Capitol Hill. I support. the Presidents economic recovery plan and I voted to reduce the budget at every reasonable opportunity. Although the elimination of the tax return preparation service is being touted as another method of reducing the budget. the IRS also recently announced that twice as many ""taxpayers will be audited In the next i few years as were audited in the past. !This will increase IRS expenditures. I The Commissioner expressed the hope that Increased audits will dissuade tax icheaters and ferret out questionable I tax shelters. I laud this goal. but I question the outcome. I do not doubt that the IRS will disCcover more Irregularities In tax returns after it halts its preparation pro*gram. Miscalculation is understandaIble considering the Incomprehensible nature of the tax forms and the conLstantly changing tax code. There will I be overpayments as well as underpaySments by lawabiding citizens who Iniadvertently miscalculate their Income or tax assessment. The U.S. Treasury iwill lose money it can Ill afford to lose -whenever there is an underpayment and taxpayers will lose money they -can Ill afford to lose whenever there Is -an overpayment. i I do not believe we should save I money by eliminating this service - which provided benefits to both the rGovernment and the taxpayer. Furthermore. the exception for CapI itol Hill Is ludicrous. Congressmen are 3able to complete their tax returns as I well as other Americans. In fact. they t may be more able since Congressmen I can use the mnoney they are not paying 3in taxes to obtain professional tax assistance. Congress already receives too many perquisites. from reducedprice haircuts in the House barbershop to tax breaks which. in effect. exclude many of us from almost any tax liability. We have earned a reputation for excluding ourselves from any painful lawsmy constituents noticed that when the Government shut down on November 23. Congress did not. having carefully passed its own appropriations billand this is one more example of Congress putting itself above the citizens we serve. The IRS exists not just to collect taxes but also to serve the taxpayers. The elimination of this seivice harms the taxpayer. especially the middleclass taxpayer who. in spite of his 5percent tax reduction. has become disillusioned watching more and more money going to feed the seemingly insatiable appetite of Uncle Sam. The exclusion for those of us on Capitol Hill gives the impression that Government agencies provide different. ""special"" treatment for Congressmen. We are not special. We. above all. should be required to suffer fObe consequences of our actions. I believe that the budget reductions we approved last year were necessary. I also believe that we in Congress must exhibit some responsibility for those reductions by sharing with the rest of the country the effects of our economic decisions."
970146939,"Mr. Speaker. may I first begin by encouraging the gentleman from Pennsylvania to participate in this special order as a fellow Member who had a similar experience as I did over the past several weeks. Recently public attention has been focused on the growing economic. political and social struggles in Central America. especially those in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Much of this public debate had been shaped by reports from several visiting Congressmen and an international press corps that has been accused of sloppy. if not biased. reporting. Few people can claim to be an expert on the complex sociopolitical equation that frames this continuing drama a few hundred miles south of the border. I did not believe that in the space of 5 days I would become an expert on the situation in Central America. but I did feel that I could formulate my approach to the debate on U.S. policy that clearly lay ahead. both more responsibly and more effectively. if I acquired firsthand knowledge of the relevant issues. I arrived in El Salvador on February 17 with three principal concerns: First. is the turmoil in El Salvador a political quagmire in which the United States might become militarily bogged down? Second. was the Salvadoran Government making ""significant progress"" in controlling the human rights violations that had appalled U.S. citizens and earned international condemnation? Third. to what degree are the Cuban and Nicaraguan regimes supporting the Salvadoran rebels? As I see it. the challenges we face is to synthesize the answers to those three questions in order to determine how the United States might foster a free and democratic system in El Salvador without involving the U.S. military. I am disturbed by the partisan and prejudiced propaganda that emerges from both the left and the right on this issue. and I seek to identify a path of accommodation. Not surprisingly. I returned after this 6day trip with more questions than answers. But I will insist on dispassionately posing those questions until credible answers emerge from the U.S. foreign policy crucible. In El Salvador. we were both well received and well treated by the Government of President Napoleon Duarte. We met with President Duarte. with Defense Minister Guillermo Garcia. with U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton. with Gen. Wallace H. Nutting and with leaders of the church and business community. We took advantage of the Presidents offer to travel wherever we pleased by visiting the village of San Antonio Abad and the Mariona Prison. where many of the political prisoners of the Government are currently held in San Salvador. I was favorably impressed by the sincerity and commitment of President Duarte. I believe that he enjoys broad support among his people and that he will continue to implement his popular program of political and economic reform. He stressed. however. that the constituent assembly elections scheduled for March 28 are a critical element to the restoration of democracy in El Salvador. a position with which I strongly concur. My favorable impression of the civilian government. however. is in contrast to my perception of El Salvadors military leadership. Few of the military leaders with whom I met seem to embrace the democratic ideals of President Duarte. I believe that this attitude was largely responsible for the apparent coverup of human rights violations which I will discuss later. Furthermore. as a result of my private meeting with President Duarte. I concluded that the military is not representing the will of the civilian government. For example. when I confronted President Durate with the informal weapons requests which had been made earlier in the day by Defense Minister Garcia. he was shocked. and he assured me that such a massive allocation of military aid was totally unnecessary. The Defense Minister had informally requested enough helicopters to move 2.000 soldiers. which I calculated would require the transfer of more than 180 helicopters. The President. on the other hand. maintained that he needed only 10 or fewer helicopters at the present time. As I met with government and military leaders. I concentrated on the three concerns which I wished to confront. and I think the Issues began to come into focus. I found that drawing analogies with the sequence of events that led us down the path toward extended involvement in Vietnam were inescapable. but for each similarity there were dozens of significant differences. In Vietnam there was a war of reunification between North and South Vietnam. In El Salvador. however. it is a war of political and class division. In Vietnam the most dominant national figure was certainly Ho Chi Minh. the primary leader of the north. In El Salvador. the most popular national figure is more than likely Napoleon Duarte himself. Americas ally. In Vietnam. U.S. troops were demanded by the governments we supported. while in El Salvador I was pleased to learn that U.S. troops are neither required nor requested. In fact. they have been adamantly refused by no less a figure then Defense Minister Garcia himself. The 11st of differences between Vietnam and El Salvador can continue at some greater length. but suffice it to say that the salient point is that we should learn lessons from our past involvement in Vietnam. but we must not allow this partial analogy to obscure our view of the reality. The human rights question is equally difficult to fathom. not only because one quickly concludes that both generals and guerrillas alike often distort the truth. but because the question is shaped by historical and socio. logical tradition as much as by current day standards of military professionalism. Nevertheless. I could not help feeling that General Garcias military forces exercised far too much autonomy and freedom from review. judicial or otherwise. In El Salvador. the local commanders. especially in rural areas outside of the main cities. have an au. thoritarian power that transcends civilian control. especially in the smaller areas distant from the oversight of the common commanders in El Salvador. We accepted the tragedy of San Antonio Abad as exemplary of the confusion that often surrounds alleged violations of human rights perpetrated in a war torn area. And in light of this. I sought to discern the truth about what occurred there. I visited this town and heard the stories of local residents that on one night this past January. members of the Salvadoran Armed Forces dragged citizens from their homez and systematically murdered them. Those whose familie- had been ""visited"" in the night. retrieved the bodies of their lifeless relatives the next morning from a stack of 20. II 918 When we confronted General Garcia with this gruesome tale. he and his lieutenants denied that the murders were systematic and offered another versionof the events. He insisted that his soldiers surrounded the town in hopes of locating a guerrilla stronghold. He contended that the soldiers were fired upon in the middle of the night. and in the ensuing battle 20 civilians were caught in the crossfire. We were shocked by the difference between the two stories and Impressed by the difficulty of discerning the ""truth."" The most conclusive evidence. however. was contributed by a U.S. embassy official who had viewed the bodies at the morgue and determined that most were shot in the back of the head at close range. This story discredited the version of Colonel Palacios and General Garcia and damaged their credibilit. and the credibility of the military in El Salvador. at least in my eyes. I concluded that the Salvadora:i military cor.inand does not have ontrol over its frontlines forces and. therefore. cannot prevent further violations of the human rights of its citizens at this time. I believe. however. that President Duarte is dedicated to harnessing this traditionally uncontrollable military machine and will do what he can to correct the situation. if we provide him the encouragement and the incentive to do so. It is already clear that the tough international scrutiny to which General Garcia is subjected is bringing him to the realization that he must ""clean up his act."" However. I should point out that there are continuing violations of human rights equaUy egregious from the left in El Salvador. Those of us who hiar arguments that the revolutionary left must be supported. ask back. ""What evidence do we have to suggest that their civilian leadership can control their military were they in power?"" There are clear examples of dramatic violations of human rights by the guerrillas. stories which are equally hard to believe and which demand full scrutiny by U.S. press. public and politicians allfe. On February 20. I left El Salvador for Nicaragua. with the hope that I might be able to address my third concorn regarding the provision of aid for the rebels in El Salvador by the Nicaraguan Government. by Cuban sources and. of course. by the Soviets as well. I also sought to identify a course of action of U.S. foreign policy that might strengthen the democratic strains in that country and at the same time diminish the antagonisms which are clearly growing between the United States and Nicaragua. During our stay. I met with Comandante Daniel Ortega. the leader of the ruling Sandinista junta in Nicaragua. but also I met with Alfonso Robelo. the leader of the opposition party in Nicaragua and with Enrique Dreyfus. a business leader. who only 2 days before our arriv1 had been released from a cruel. extended detainment in the Managua prison. I also met with church officials and others. both within the Sandinista ruling junta and without. My visit. unfortunately. was framed by a background of strident antiAmerican rhetoric. due in part to the public commemoraton of the death of Augusto Sandino. who I learned was the founder of the Sandinista movement. While I recognize that a residue of antiAmerican sentiment might be expected in a country in which we have been so directly involved in past decades. I was dismayed. shocked and terrifiod. to discover that this hatred is being perpetuated and employed by the Government as a distraction for the masses from the obvious shortcomings of their owri political rule. In meeting with the leaders of the Sandinista regime. I encountered an unwillingness on their part wo diminish their belligerent accusations leveled against the United States and. I concluded that the Sandinista government clearly prefers to tilt. in fact overwhelmingly tilt. toward the Soviet Union and Cuba. I asked Daniel Ortega. ""Comandante. suppose I go back to the United States and somehow the U.S. Congress can be persuaded to change dramatically its relationship with Nicaragua. to take steps that would lead to a restoration of economic aid and to a guarantee of no external military intervention. What then could I say to the U.S. people. to our Congress. that you would be willing to do in return? Would you. for example. be willing to say that you would not allow the Soviets to build an air force base in Nicaragua? Would you be persuaded to discourage Nicaraguan support for other revolutionary movements in Central America?"" Sadly. I report that Comandante Ortega said no to all my offers for compromise. While the Sandinistas did enjoy broad support at the inception of their rule. it is clear that this support is quickly eroding. I was told that the original Sandlnista movement was supported by almost 95 percent of the people of Nicaragua 3 years ago. but just last month I was informed that today only a third of the people in Nicaragua support the course that country is following. The Sandinista government has lost the confidence of the middle class and the leadership of the Catholic church. Just a week before my arrival. all seven bishops of the Catholic church in Nicaragua condemned the Sandinistas for t lie ruthless. forced resettlement ol the Miskito Indians and the killing of innocent Miskito Indians who were unwilling to cooperate with the government in this resettlement program. Both the church and the middle class are condemning this government for its repression. and sadly they have become the new victims of the Sandinistas rhetorical abuse as a result. I found my interview with Enrique Dreyfus and Alfonso Robelo particularly enlightening. Both of these leaders confirmed allegations that the repressive policies of the Sandinista regime have caused a marked decrease in the popularity of the government. I found the violations of human rights in Nicaragua to be no less reprehensible than those In El Salvador. though obviously I recognize that the actual loss of life due to those violations and due to the continuing war In El Salvador is considerably L- **ater. I am particularly outraged. however. by the suffering that these Miskito Indians are enduring at the hands of the government. The Sandinistas have systematically relocated. jailed and caused great suffering to thousands of Indians in the northeast. section of Nicaragua. We heard numerous reports about Indians who lost their lives at the hands of government soldiers. When the congressional delegation requested an opportunity to travel to the riverfronts along the Coco River. where these villages have been burned and where massacres allegedly have taken place. we were flatly denied the chance to make a visit. This is in clear contrast to our experience in El Salvador. where the Duarte government allowed us a free rein and a free passport throughout the country. My visit to Managua clearly demonstrated the broad extent of Cubas involvement in that country. a role that neither the Sandinist.as nor the Cubans seem to deny. Although Mr. Ortega did not discuss the Nicaraguan role in supplying the rebels in El Salvador. both Mr. Dreyfus and Mr. Rubelo confirmed that the transfer of military assistance is extensive. This trip left. me with a great many impressions that I needed to assess. I had no doubt. however. about the need of our Government to act fairly and decisively in an effort to bring peace and democracy to Central America. both to left and right wing governments. Following are several of my recommendations. I believe that President Duarte and the political and economic reforms he has implemented deserve our continuing support. Because the constitutent assembly elections scheduled for March 28 are a critical element of President Duartes plan to restore democracy to his country. we must affirm our belief in the importance of these elections and strive to insure that they are fair and representative. Attainment of this goal will be more feasible if we enlist the support of our NATO and other Latin American allies in overseeing the voting process. This support of free elections should be accompanied by negotiations aimed at involving as many political groups as realistically possible in the government. as has been suggested by Bishop Rivera y Damas and President Lopez Portillo of Mexico. Furthermore. I applaud President Reagans Caribbean basin initiative as a recognition that economic growth can promote political stability in this region. It seemed to me that the guerrillas effort to undermine the economic infrastructure of the country is at least as dangerous as an effort to overthrow the government. President Duarte. for example. has emphasized the need for buses. pointing out that just in the past few weeks almost 200 buses have been destroyed in El Salvador. I am opposed to further military aid to El Salvador at this time. however. not only because I believe that the military command has not adequately protected the citizens of El Salvador from violations of human rights. but also because I think that granting military aid at this time will strengthen the military faction of the government. especially in these weeks leading up to the elections. which cannot be supportive of a solution based on reconciliation achieved through peaceful means. Furthermore. in recognition of the demonstrated gap in communication between the civilian and military leaders we must clarify that our support is for the civilian governments efforts to achieve a political and economic solution and not for the militarys attempts to achieve victory on the battlefield. Despite the unfriendly rhetoric which is emerging from Nicaragua. I believe that we must not pass up this chance to negotiate with the Sandinistas. but obviously we need a third party intermediary. It is clear that we must use our leverage to do anything possible to discourage the Nicaraguans from continuing to support the flow of arms to the rebels in El Salvador. For this reason. I have supported the initiative proposed by President Portillo of Mexico to establish substantive negotiations with the Sandinistas. In this process. however. we must not ignore the violations of human rights that have been committed by the Nicaraguan Government. just as we do not ignore the violations in El Salvador. Finally. I am convinced that U.S. military intervention in Nicaragua is not the avenue to the institution of peace and democracy in that country. I believe that our evolving policy toward the turmoil in Central America must stress the importance of fair and free elections and negotiations. where appropriate. in an effort to foster democracy and stability and to avert further military conflict. I believe that the Presidents Caribbean basin initiative is this type of response and I am strongly supportive of our efforts to promote economic and hence political stability. I cannot. on the other hand. support the notion that further military aid to El Salvador at this time will be a constructive influence in this process. especially when we are trying to do all that we can to encourage a moderate conclusion in the election process just 2 weeks away. Finally. I maintain that if we are to continue to employ the human rights records of other countries as a criterion in the provision of U.S. aid. then we must apply that requirement fairly and consistently. Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity now ) see if there may be other members. other colleagues. who would like to participate."
970152637,"Mr. Speaker. some wise poltitican many. many centuries ago said. I am sure. that opportunity only knocks once. Of course. there are many frustrated Republican Members of Congress here today who spoke out earlier In the day in 1minute speeches saying that we have not had an opportunity even yet to really constructively begin to reduce the Federal budget. Fortunately. we have had at least one opportunity to try to reduce the budget of th6 committees of the Congress itself. and 2 weeks ago I am pleased that our body decided to take that. opportunity. to seize it. and do what we can to reduce spending In the Federal Government. at least when we have this onealbeit a smallopportunity to try to reduce spending. First. I would like to thank and commend the members of the House Administration Committee. both Democrats and Republican alike. for recognizing this opportunity when it was presented to them 2 weeks ago. They went back to their committee. and I must confess. did a job of reducing $700.000 out of these committee funding resolutions. I stand before the Members today to hope that opportunity can knock again and again and again over the next 12 months so that we can reduce Federal spending every ingle opportunity that we have. This body was elected a year and a half ago to do just that. to reduce Federal spending. and I am happy that we are showing in a small way that we can have the resolve. Of course. the freshmen Members of the Republican Party in Congress played an active role in seizing this opportunity. and I am proud of the effort we made to convince our colleagues and Members on both sides of the aisle of the importance of bringing fiscal responsibility to Congress. Many of us feel as I do. that it has been a long. long time since Congress has fPlt the need to reduce spending. Some of us feel it has been 30 or 40 years. and now we are beginning to learn to do something that many of us have not done in a generation. learning to use the word ""less"" rather than ""more."" My colleague from Texas. only a minute ago. criticized the freshmen for taking the opportunity in the 1minute speeches to call for some action in Congress. we are frustrated that Congress has not done anything yet. but we are not asking for more laws. as he alleged. We are asking for less laws. we ate asking. most of all. for one law. the budget law. to give us less spending in the Federal Government. We cannot deliver to the American people that which they are desiring. that which they are seeking. that which they are pleading fora balanced budget. lower taxes. lower Interest rates. unless we recognize our opportunity to cut spending every chance we have. My colleague. the respected chairman of the subcommittee. mentioned earlier in the day that we need this $40 million to run our committees because we have the responsibility of spending hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. and how can we do that well unless we spend millions of dollars running our committees? That is exactly the type of thinking that has gotten us in the mess we are in today. They declare that the only way we can solve our problems is to throw more money at them. That is not our charge. Our responsibility is to make the money we take from the American taxpayers work harder. make the people that work. work harder. and I am convinced that of the 1.700 men and women who work in the committees. on the staffs of the committees of Congress. we can get them to work harder. We can get them to do more for less. and we should take this opportunity to show that this is exactly what the American people want them to do. One of the most troubling things I have heard in the debate here this afternoon. though. was from my colleague. the chairman of the subcommittee. that he cannot guarantee that we will have no supplementals during the course of the year. I want to compliment him for not having any supplementals last year. I just hope and plead that he can reconsider and guarantee to us today that we will have no supplementals during this calendpr year. We have got to show the American working men and women that we are committed to tightening our belts. Does the gentleman realize. for exemple. that there are over a million union members in this country today. who have in the past 12 months provided concessions in their union contracts?"
970197462,"Madam Speaker. the equal rights amendment is another important step in the journey to equality for all Americans. Many decades have passed since this journey began and many milestones have been reached. but so much more ground is waiting to be traversed. The equal rights amendment is not a superfluous . exercise inserted midstride in the journey to equality. Although there are now more women in college than at any time in our Nations history. more women in State legislatures than at any time in our Nations history. and more women in Congress than at any time in our Nations history. full equality has yet to be realized. We cannot look at these achievements and complacently allege that women are now equal and no more needs to be done. Just as the right to vote was a critical advance. ment in the march toward equality for women so. too. will be the passage of the ERA. Without the equal rights amendment. equality must be litigated case by casea slow process that does not insure universal protection. Women should not have to go to court to fight for equality in the workplace. equality in pay. equality in educational opportunity. equality in pension benefits. or in social security. Neither should the equality of women be dependent on laws that can be repealed or changed by a simple majority. The rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the responsibilities imposed by the Constitution cannot and should not be denied by reason of a persons sex. The passage of the equal rights amendment is a vital step in the inexorable march toward equality for women. It must. and will. be realized.e a Mr. BROWN of California. Madam Speaker. our Nation which was founded on the principle of ""Justice for all."" has historically been unjust to over onehalf of its population: women. From the time that Abigail Adams wrote to her husband. John. only partly tongue in cheek. ""If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladles. we are determined to foment a rebellion. and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation."" women have been struggling. They struggled for over a century to obtain what should have been a simple right. the right to vote. Now they are struggling for another simple and hardfought right. the right of equality. With todays introduction of the equal rights amendment (ERA). the history of this struggle continues. The necessity for this struggle is not something to be proud of. Since it was originally introduced in 1923. the ERA has fought a constant battle against those who wish to maintain their power. Yet time and time again polls overwhelmingly indicate that the vast majority of Anmericans support this simple constitutional amendment. At the first womens convention at Seneca Falls. N.Y.. in 1848. it resolved. ""That it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise."" It took over 70 years to obtain that right. but what is significant about that resolution is that it pro. claimed it womens duty to secure their rights. Just as men must participate today. they must have participated then. but the impetus. the leadership. the drive must come from women. Women have learned these important skills in their participation of the abolitionist. labor. and civil rights movements. It is no coincidence that after each of these movements obtained great strides. women in turn called attention to their demands. their rights. This last decade of struggle has been particularly difficult and frustratingthe ERA goal so close and yet failing. But one thing women did learn. and unfortunately it was a hard lesson. is that women must fight for their rights. As simple. as sensible. as those rights may seem. no one will give them away. And once those rights are secured. as undoubtedly they will be. the fight to preserve those rights will have to be maintained. Recently. women have begun to understand just how vulnerable they still are as nearly every program. every advance. has been attacked or weakened by the Reagan administration. The Womens Education Equity Act. title IX. family planning. the equal rights amendment. and countless other programs and regulations have been threatened. am pleased to see that women are learning to be politically aware and are striking back. Then. perhaps their daughters will not have to fight the same battle.. until one day the motto of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony will ring true. ""Men. their rights and nothing more. women. their rights and nothing less.""e"

970228974,"Mr. Speaker. many of my colleagues have already given eloquent reasons to oppose this tax bill. I rise to add my voice to the pleas of others who hope for its defeat. This is not a small bill. a simple set of painless measures that close loopholes and bring effortless compliance with existing law. Instead it holds a hidden snake. a very painful. permanent economic poison that will affect our economy and all Americans for decades to come. I am. of course. referring to the proposed withholding of interest on dividends. Here our Government is extending the long arm of the IRS into the pockets of those Americans who receive these interest and dividend payments in a way that will discourage savings and investing for generations to come and at a time when we all know we need desperately to bolster our Nations capital base. At the same time. this withholding proposal will slow the drop of interest rates or perhaps even reverse the favorable trend we have seen over the past few weeks. and further crowd out * the American saver and investor from access to capital markets they need if we are going to faster a recovery. We often describe our Nations source of capital as a ""pool of savings."" If that is so then this tax bill is going to siphon off those funds from that pool into the Federal Treasury. In short. we are getting hosed. Some say we need that siphon so that we can take the funds out of the interest and savings pool and put the money right back into that interest and savings pool. sort of like a perpetual motion machine that will somehow miraculously create a recovery of our economy. Nonsense. If we drain that pool via increase4 interest and dividend withholding. it is just as catastrophic as draining the pool by further increasing the national debt or increased Federal borrowing. In either case. our economy will continue to suffer for the months ahead. Is it fair to punish all American savers permanently for decades. if not for centuries. just so that we can achieve a shortterm gain in the revenue collection process of our country? Obviously it is not. This withholding proposal is a phony ""tax enhancement."" It Is a step which cannot easily be reversed. It is a course of action we will all come to regret."

980001857,Mr. President. I rise today to offer Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 with my colleague Senator HEINZ and other interested colleagues. We offer this measure in an effort to head off a pending financial crisis in the railroad retirement system. Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 is straightforward and direct. It calls on railroad labor and management to immediately discuss the financial difficulties facing the railroad retirement program in order to reach a joint agreement on how to resolve these financial problems. Mr. President. I have had a longstanding concern for the railroad retirement system. I supported the amendment of my colleague. Mr. METZENBAUM. to the 1982 continuing appropriations bill that provided full retirement benefits to retirees that were eligible for both social security and railroad retirement benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974. I worked with my distinguished colleague. Mr. HEINZ. in December 1981 to block .a proposed OMB Impoundment of railroad retirement funds that would have reduced benefits by some $50 million. And I subsequently requested and received a GAO report on March 5. 1982. which clearly stated that OMB had exceeded its authority in attempting to impound these funds. I also offered a successful amendment to the first concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1983 that provided for full funding of various railroad retirement benefits during that fiscal year. This amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 57 to 40 on May 21. 1982. and was contained in the conference report on the first concurrent budget resolution. Mr. President. the Congress supports a strong. stable. and solvent railroad retirement system. They want such a system to protect the rightful benefits of the more than 1 million beneficiaries of the railroad retirement system. The current state of the economy and increases in the level of railroad unemployment have hurt the financial status of the railroad retirement system. The chief actuary of the Railroad Retirement Board. in various communications to the Board. has noted that increases in tier 2 tax rates and possibly even Increases in tonmile taxes may have to be considered by July of this year if full benefits under the railroad retirement system are to be forthcoming. Over the years there have been declining trust fund balances in the Railroad Retirement Fund. Yet. the Congress has acted on several occasions to make changes in the railroad retirement system in order to Insure continued timely payment of benefits. It will continue to do with the cooperation of railroad management and labor. The Congress. with the advise of the Railroad Retirement Board. and representatives of rail management and labor stands ready to tackle the cur. rent problems of the railroad retirement system in a prudent and responsible manner. That is why Senator HEINZ. and I. along with out distinguished colleagues offer Senate Concurrent Resolution 5. at this early date in this session of Congress. I urge quick Senate action on this measure.
980010825,"Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation which closes some of the contractual loopholes presently operative under the NOPA which are causing major increases in natural gas prices. Millions of consumers continue to be devastated by rapidly escalating natural gas prices. I believe that the socalled takeorpay clauses in many purchase gas contracts are at the very core of the pricing problems presently facing consumers. During the debates concerning the NOPA. a major source of concern among all parties was the adequacy of the supply of natural gas. At that time. there was a severe shortage of natural gas in the market. At that time. these takeorpay contract clauses appeared to be a method by which to assure the longterm supply of natural gas for consumers. Mr. President. many of these takeorpay clauses require the purchase of high cost gas for periods extending over 10 to 15 years. The rigid terms of these contract provisions are now distorting the natural gas market. The result has been and continues to be higher prices for consumers. . At present. ""old"" gas constitutes an estimated 40 percent of our Nations natural gas supplies. The vast majority of this old gas is owned by the major oil companies. Last year. approximately 56 percent of the gas purchased by major interstate pipelines consisted of old gas. Thus. old gas. to the extent that it is currently available. has served an important function in the natural gas marketplace in helping to keep overall gas prices down. Yet. Mr. President. this year. it has been estimated that well over 2.7 trillion cubic feet of old. lower cost gas is being shut in in existing fields. Thus. a major shource of cheap gas. available for delivery to consumers. is instead being systematically withheld from the natural gas marketplace. In its place. pipeline companies are being strictly held td the rigid terms of these takeorpay contract provisions. pipelines are presently required to pay for the high priced gas which. as most parties readily admit. is without a viable market. Mr. President. it is the consumer who has been forced to pay the ultimate price. The legislation that I am introducing attempts to provide some relief from these rigid contract terms. My legislation is intended to provide relief to the natural gas consumer from the unnecessary influx of higher priced gas in the market. Specifically. S. 740 requires all contracts for the first sale of natural gas. except those contracts involving the ""old"" forever regulated gas to include a market out provision. This market out provision is intended to recognize changed conditions in the supply and demand of natural gas. The exorbitant prices that consumers are now being forced to pay for a vital service is due to just such changes in the marketplace. In addition. my legislation would not require the total abrogation of these purchase gas contracts. Instead. where the natural gas is no longer marketable. the market out provision allows a reduction in the volume to a level of 70 percent. The price of the gas under the renegotiated contract would then reflect the average cubic foot price of all the gas under the contract. Mr. President. I believe that the approach that I am offering is fair. Given the present fluctuations in the natural gas market. market out clauses provide a reasonable and flexible mechanism by which to respond to changes in supply and demand. Producers. under my approach. should not be discouraged regarding the continuation of drilling and exploration of new natural gas sources. I believe that this 70percent reduction in volume will provide mutual incentives to producers and pipelines alike to seek the cheapest sources of natural gas possible. The result would be the continued availability of an adequate supply of natural gas at lower prices that consumers could afford. More importantly. from the consumers standpoint. my legislation maintains the NOPA commitment to cheap prices on ""old"". forever regulated gas. This old gas has been and continues to be the maior source of consurmer protection under the NGPA. I believe that by maintaining these old. low cost sources of natural gas. in conjunction with contract renegotiations. we will be able to provide consumers with some welldeserved relief. As old gas supplies continue to dwindle. the remaining supplies of ""old"" gas will serve as a vital cushion for the new. higher priced sources of natural gas which will inevitably displace the cheaper supplies. By way of contrast. however. the administrations decontrol bill will bring further pricing burdens to bear on the natural gas consumer. The administrations bill calls for the decontrol of all gas. including the old. lower cost supplies of natural gas. Under the administrations bill. producers have no real incentive to renegotiate these takeorpay contract clauses. Instead. in 1985. the producers are given a unilateral green light to hold all of their old gas supplies and thereafter sell such lower cost gas for prices far in excess of the current $1.25 million cubic feet price. The result will be an estimated $40 billion windfall for these producers at the further expense of the natural gas consumer. A recent GAO study indicates that under total price decontrol. the contract induced fly up of prices is likely to be more widespread than under the NGPA decontrol. Indeed. the administrations bill would have a devastating impact on the average annual residential gas bill in Tennessee. For example. in Nashville. the average annual residential gas bill in 1982 was $703.11 under NGPA decontrol. If the administrations bill were enacted. by 1986. these same consumers would be paying roughly $1.149 for their gas bills. In Knoxville. Memphis. and Chattanooga. this basic upward price trend could also be expected as consumers in these areas would also be forced to pay in excess of $1.000 annually for their natural gas. That. Mr. President. is clearly an unconscionable burden for consumers anywhere to be forced to pay. Mr. President. for the millions of poor and elderly natural gas consumers. the rapidly escalating price of natural gas has meant an ordeal of far greater proportions. Lowincome consumers presently spend an estimated 30 percent of their total incomes for energy expenditures. Many poverty level families spend from 40 to 50 percent of their budget on fuel and utility bills. Since the 1970s. the steadily in.creasing cost of energy for these consumers has meant zce loss of $9 billion in purchasing power. For these lowincome consumers. brute survival has become a matter of vital concern. Mr. President. the time for relief for natural gas consumers is long overdue. I am introducing this legislation today in an effort to begin the crucial task of bringing to a halt the current runaway trend in natural gas prices. Mr. President. I urge each of my colleagues to join with me in this endeavor. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of 8. 740 be printed immediately following my remarks."
980023781,"Mr. President. small businesses make great use of human resources. Studies done by Dun & Bradstreet and other national groups show that the vast majority of hiring within the private sector over the past several years has occurred in companies with 100 or fewer workers. Yet. while our present tax system is loaded with incentives for capital investment. precious little is being done to provide incentives for investment In human assets. human resources. At a time when the Nations jobless rate is still over 10 percent and the business failure rate is almost 600 a week. we must take steps to rectify this Imbalance. One thing we can do is provide additional tax credits to small businesses. helping them grow and prosper thereby furthering overall economic recovery. In the past. I have spoken out on the advantages to be gained through the use of jobs tax credits and have pointed out that small businesses have not been receiving their fair share of tax credits. Along with several of my colleagues. I have introduced legislation. S. 371. which addresses this situation. This bill offers small businesses increased savings and provides them with a substantial employment incentive that does not currently exist. Since introducing this measure. I have been contacted by numerous small business persons across the country who have indicated their interest in this measure. Typical of the correspondence and inquiries I have received is a letter from Leisure Development Corp. of America. Inc.. located in Rutherford. N.J. This firm stressed the significant role that the availabilIty of Jobs tax credits plays in planning future development of their operations. With enactment of S. 371. this company and many others like it across America could step up plans to hire the unemployed and put people back to work. Mr. President. I ask that the letter from Leisure Development Corp. be printed in the RECORD at this point. The letter referred to follows: Hon. Jim SASSER. U.S. Senate. Washington. D.C. DEAR SENATOR SASSER: Leisure Development Corporation of America. Inc. Is the owner and operator of Gadgets. a new family style restaurant chain. We expect to open numerous units throughout the country and eventually employ over 100 people at each location. As with all new companies. startup costs are often very high. and the restaurant industry is very much aware of this situation. The tax savings we hope to quality for through the employment of Targeted Jobs Tax Credit eligible people may be a factor in influencing our future development. As we understand it. TJTC was established to assist people who have the most difficulty finding employment. In our newest Gadgets approximately 10% of the employees qualify under the TJTC program. Your bill entitled. ""The Targeted Jobs Tax Credit Amendments Act of 1983"" would enable us to qualify for additional credits while we help alleviate the unemployment problem for an economically disadvantaged group of people. We are pleased to help disadvantaged people find work at Gadgets and hope to give other TJTC eligible people the opportunity for employment in our forthcoming restaurants. Yours truly."
980064931,Mr. President. today. I announce my support of a bipartisan effort to establish a comprehensive na. tional policy regarding Central AmerIca. Specifically. I am cosponsoring legislation introduced by Senator JACKSON and Senator MATHIAS designed to create a presidentially appointed commission with membership from both political partiesa nonpartisan commissionwhich will examine the situation in this important region of the world and make recommendations to the Nation regarding future American policy. This commission would be similar to the commissions which studied the issues of social security and the MX missile. Mr. President. there Is a growing concern throughout the country that the policies of the Reagan administration could lead this Nation into an overreaction to events in Central America. Yet. we must never lose sight of the fact that this region is strategically vital to the security of the United States. In my considered judgment we must not allow the spread of Cuban and Soviet Influence in the region. That much is clear. but the solution to the I problems of pentral America cannot be found through the barrel of a gun. The history of the region. indeed the history of Vietnam. teaches us that we must not attempt military solutions to regional economic and social problems. It is time to call for a halt in hostilities and for a beginning to negotiations for peace. For example. the United States should endorse the suggestions by the Contadora groupthe countries of Mexico. Colombia. Venezuela. and Panamato promote reglonal negotiations. No one wants war in Central America. So. our efforts must be directed at a cooling of tensions. We must guard against the prospect that rising hoAtilities could lead to a broader American involvement in the region. We must not allow American involvement to reach the point of no return. Just this past week. the administration sent 120 Green Berets into Honduras to train soldiers of the El Salvador Army. We are constructing an airfield in Honduras which could accommodate American Air Force transports. and the administration is requesting approval of a second airfield. with additional ones under consideration. The Cubans and the Soviets are embarking on a similar buildup in the neighboring country of Nicaragua. Many observers in the Pentagon itself have indicated that the actions and counteractions by the superpowers in Central America are not all that dissimilar to the tragic actions in Southeast Asia 20 years ago. We must not allow Central America to become another Vietnam. Clearly the geography. the people. and the culture of Central America are substantially different than Southeast Asia. Yet. we are reacting to the crisis in Central America in much the same manner as this Nation reacted to events in Vietnam two decades ago. The bipartisan commission suggested by Senate Resolution 158 would make a report to the Nation within the next 6 months. I am confident that it will find that the problems of Central America can only be solved with a longterm policy aimed at reducing the effects of poverty. poor education. and a lack of regional industrial infrastructure. Likewise. our policy must be directed at promoting a stronger regional democratic center and a growing middle class to reduce the leftist and rightist political and military competition. I am under no illusion concerning the Central America Commission. Such a commission cannot. alone. answer all the complex problems of U.S. Involvement in Central America. But as other commissions have demonstrated. it could help bring focus to the problem and provide a less politically charged forum for future policy considerations. So. for that reason. I am supporting this bipartisan effort. Mr. President. the first American soldier to die in Vietnam was a young
980076868,"Mr. President. today I join with Senators BUMPERS. JACKSON. HART. and EAGLETON in cosponsoring S. 1641. the Nonpartisan Scientific Advisory Committee Act of 1983. I think this is a good amendment that will improve the effectiveness of scientific and technical advisers to the Federal agencies. Scientists should be evaluated for their fitness to serve on committees specifically set up as a source of advice to the Federal agencies in their fields on the basis of their professionalism and the evidence of their expertise. Yet the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Frank Fahrenkopf. Jr.. has said publicly that all Federal departments save State. Justice. and Defense routinely rely on the Republican National Committee to check out candidates politically. Specific examples abound. Secretary of the Interior James Watt defended and stated his support for checking with the RNC on appointments to advisory committees when he was questioned about it on CBS ""Face the Nation"" last March. In 1981. thenAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Anne Gorsuch refused to continue the tradition of reappointing members of scientific advisory panels at her agency. It was rumoured among EPA officials that her purpose was to replace them with certified political conservatives. Career officials at the Food and Drug Administration successfully blocked the appointment of obviously unqualified persons to a panel of science advisers on vaccine policy. There is too much at stake for us as a nation to allow politics to play a role in the appointment of individuals to review technical or scientific issues for our Government agencies. The kind of political blackballing that has occurred under this administration robs us of many of the best and brightest of our scholars and researchers for service on these commissions. The problems we face are too serious for that. Issues like toxic waste and clean air should be fairly reviewed by experts. These policies should be not set according to the advice of ideologists or represenatives of specialinterest groups. Senator BUMPERS is to be commended for bringing this situation to the attention of the Senate by introducing S. 1641. I am pleased to join with him in this effort. As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee which is charged with oversight of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. I think it is high time we gave the agencies some guidance on the kinds of appointments we expect in light of current practices."
980154847,"Mr. President. nearly $2.9 million in interest penalties were pald to businesses In fiscal year 1983 by I ie Federal Government as a result of the Prompt Payment Act of 1982. This fact provides sufficient proof for those of us who worked hard for passage of prompt payments legislation that the record of the Federal Government in making its payments to businesses on timethat is. within 30 days- left room for Improvement. When I introduced 8.30. which led to 1982s Prompt Payments Act. on January 5. 1981. 1 said then that adopt ion of a 30day time period in which the Federal Government must pay its bills or face interest charges makes good business sense."" There were those who resisted this iniiative. claiming that it would hamstring Federal finance managers. Thise of us who supported this initiative pointed to a 1978 General Accounting Office study which indicated that nearly 40 percent of the bills paid by the Federal Government were late paymn iits. Now. with implementation of the Prompt Payments Act.. David Stockman. Director of the Office of Manaccin(nt and Budget (OMB). reports that ""over 99 percent of payments for gocods and services are now being made on1 t im1e."" The correlation is obvious. The prosplet of interest penalties that would have to come from already pinched agency budgets encouraged more efficlent payment policies by Federal finance managers -policies which ultimately bende it everyone. There is still much work to be done. however. in effecting an even better record of prompt payment of bills by Federal agencies. While 99 percent of bills owed by the Federal Government were paid on time in fiscal year 1983. there were an estimated 180.000 bills that were not paid on time. These bills constitute the 1 percent. If the breakdown of these part icular bills reflects the data contained in the 1978 GAO study. it means that the overwhelming number of the 180.000 bills involved small businesses. Small businesses just do not have the cashflow capability nor administrative resources to pursue overdue accounts the way large corporations do. In his report to the Congress on the first year of the law. OMB Director Stockman suggests that most problems with the implementation of the Prompt Payments Act came with the Department of Defense (DOD). and he says that OMB has been assured that DODs payment problems will be overcome in 1984. rhe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. on which I serve. is continuing its series of hearings into DOD management and spending policies. And the Small Business Committee. on which I also serve. is also considering the role of small businesses in DOD procurement policies. So. the opportunity will exist for the Senate to encourage even greater compliance with the spirit and the text. of the Prompt Payments Act--as it involves small businesses and as it involves DOD. two parties most affected by its implementationand in doing so. showing that good business practices in Government benefit everyone. Mr. President. I ask that the OMB report on the Prompt Payments Act be printed in the RECORD. The report follows:"
980173603,"I will detail just a few of these matters this afternoon. Mr. President. There are some 20 to 25 incidents of Contra activity within a 30day period. Beginning on February 25. two Nicaraguan fishing boats hit mines and sank at the Caribbean port of El Bluff. two more vessels are damaged. two fishermen are killed. and seven are wounded. On March 1. a Dutch dredging ship hits a mine at the Pacific port of CorInto. five persons are injured. damage to the Dutch vessel is assessed at $1 million: The same day border towns in Nicaragua are attacked with mortars firing from behind the Honduran border. Two days later a helicopter coming from Honduras attacks a Nicaraguan patrol boat in the Gulf of Fonseca firing two rockets. no hits. On March 7. a Nicaraguan truck carrying 9.000 gallons of propane is blown up 3 miles from the Honduran border. The same day a Panamanian freighter is damaged by an explosion caused by mines at the port of Corinto. and it goes on and on. March 12 the FDN blows up several towers that carry electricity to Honduras from Nicaragua. On March 14. the ARDE attacks a village in the department of Rio San Juan. killing a child and seriously wounding four others. On March 16. the FDN kills three peasants and a school director in Estell. On March 16. seven members of a farm cooperative are killed in San Ramon. Madriz. On March 17. 11 peasants die in an ambush and seven more are abducted in Puebo Nuevo. Estell. On March 20. a Soviet oil tanker is seriously damaged when it hits a mine at the Pacific port of Sandino and five crewmen are injured. It goes on and on. Mr. President. the administration is supporting the Contras and its political leadership. the FDN. in a war that cannot be won. Pressreports have indicated that even CIA assessments indicate the Contras cannot topple the Sandinistas. Independent observers have told me there is no chance of a Contra victory. no chance. that is. unless there is U.S. military intervention. Last July. members of the FDN directorate publicly called for U.S. milltary intervention. They announced their plans a month later to occupy large portions of Nicaraguan territory and stated ""we want repression to increase in Nicaragua. That is our strategy."" In February of this year a FDN communique called ""for the immediate replacement"" of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Mr. President. we are supporting the contras. despite these statements. despite the statements that they wish to overthrow the government of Nicaragua with force and violence. And despite the fact that some of their activities would be characterized as terrorist in other lands and in other times. And despite the factperhaps this is as damaging as any. Mr. Presidentthat they cannot win. Not only are we throwing away tens of millions of taxpayers dollars. but this great democracy. which Thomas Jefferson called over 200 years ago ""the last best hope of mankind."" is endorsing activities and supporting activities which are contrary to international law. Of course. there are some who believe the Nicaraguans represent a milltary threat to its neighbors. There is no doubt that there has been a significant military buildup in Nicaragua. But most Independent observers see that buildup as fundamentally defensive and substantially in response to U.S. policies and Contra attacks. I am advised that we have poured 25 percent more military aid into El Salvador and Honduras than the Cubans and Soviet bloc have sent to Nicaragua over the past 4 years. But every time we step up military support for Contra attacks. the Sandinistas turn closer to the Soviets. Shortly after the Soviet ship hit a Contraplanted mine in Corinto Harbor. the Sandinista Defense Minister flew to the Soviet Union to plead for more aid. Mr. President. some have stated that the Nicaraguans were planning to invade Honduras last year. But the former Chief of the Honduran Armed Forces. General Alvarez. publicly discounted such a possibility. In fact. a book just published by the Carnegie Foundation states: The current Nicaraguan buildup is fundamentally defensive and the Nicaraguan Army poses no Immediate threat to its neighbors. So if the Contras cannot topple the Sandinistas and they are not interdicting arms to El Salvador. what is our purpose in subsidizing their activities with American tax dollars? The book in its study of Nicaragua goes further: Fouryear arms buildup has made it unlikely that the country could be successfully invaded by any combination of Central American countries. Their forces are not sufficient to invade even the relatively lightly armed Honduras. Continuing. the book states: Nicaragua would have difficulty sustaining an invasion. given its limited fuel supply and logistical capabilities. particularly if the Honduran Air Force struck Nicaraguan fuel and supply depots and the United States blocked resupply by sea. Mr. President. Orginally the administration justified aid to the Contras on the grounds of interdicting the arms flow from Nicaraguan to Salvadoran rebels. But as early as April 1981 the State Department revealed that there has been ""no hard evidence of arms movement through Nicaragua"" since the State Department issued a white paper which purported to document such shipments. In March 1983 the New York Times reported that ""no significant weapons shipments have been intercepted on their way to El Salvador in the last two years."" The recent edition of ""Foreign Affairs"" also states that no such weapons were Intt rdicted in all of Administration officials have Indicated that such military pressure could serve to bring the Sandinistas to the bargaining table. Well. that is not very convincing because the Sandinistas have indeed offered to enter into negotiations. On July 19. 1983. the Government of Nicaragua offered to negotiate on the following points: Removal of foreign military advisers from the area. prohibiting the use of one country to carry out military destabilization of another country. and cutting off any arms flow or outside intervention in the internal affairs of any country in the area. That is a pietty wide ranging agenda for negotiation. I would observe. Mr. President. Again. last October the Nicaraguans published drafts of peace treaties for consideration of the United States and the Central American countries. Mr. President. the Nicaraguans have stated they will sign a negotiated peace agreement which provides for onsite verification to assure that no Soviet or Cuban bases are built in Nicaragua and that no arms are being shipped to rebels fighting in other countries. The Nicaraguans have now offered to negotiate on almost every point raised by the Reagan administration. But the Reagan administration has turned a deaf ear to these peace Initiatives. The administration says the Nicaraguans cannot be trusted to negotiate seriously. But how can that statement be verified unless we call their hand and attempt to enter into negotiations? How do we know the Nicaraguans will not seriously negotiate unless we are willing to enter into negotiations. And what do we have to lose? If the Sandinistas do not negotiate in good faith or If they subsequently break a peace treaty. the United States still can exercise a whole host of options. including cranking up the Contras again. if we wish. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the draft peace treaties be printed in the RECORtD at this point."
980182604,"Mr. President. I wish to honor the contribUtions made to our National Government by military. postal. and civilian service retirees. In their Federal careers. these outstanding individuals did a truly outstanding job of administering the laws that we. the Congress. enacted. They provided continuity and stability to our country in periods of turmoil. And they gave a diverse succession of Presidents the expertise needed to implement their policies. Every community in the country relies on the letter carriers. agricultural agents. civil engineers and others who enter public service. In Tennessee. we are proud of the accomplishments of these workers. Their responsiveness of our needs and their fine contributions to our governmental system deserve our sincere appreciation and greatest admiration. Unfortunately. for the past several years. retirees from the Federal service have figured heavily in the Reagan administrations cost control plans. They have experienced large reductions in health and costofliving benefits. and .basic changes in the retirement system have created confusion. doubt. and deep anxiety among Federal retirees. I have been in the forefront of the opposition to these efforts to undermine the integrity of the civil service retirement system. We have promised reasonable benefits to those who are currently retirees. as well as those who are now contributing toward a future retirement. And we should honor our commitment. In Tennessee. there are 18.958 retired employees with average annuities of $1.062 a month. There are 7.184 persons receiving survivor annuities on the average of $486 a month. These individuals have earned these benefits after long years of Federal service. And their retirement income is fully taxably. Civil servants are. on the whole. selfless dedicated individuals who are a source of pride for those of us who value the merit system under which they work. The standards for their selection are very high. A stable Federal retirement system is important to attracting and retaining talented and productive employees to Government careers. I pledge to continue to work on behalf of the Federal retiree in Congress to preserve the Integrity of their benefits. -. I congratulate Tennessees retired Federal workers on their service to the U.S. Government. The week of April 2228 has been designated ""Retired Federal Employees Week"" in Tennessee. With unanimous consent. I ask that the gubernatorial proclamation announcing this week be printed in the RECORD."
980248057,Mr. President. I rise today to submit a resolution of great import to our current economic situation. The resolution that I am offering calls on the Reagan administration to come forward with reasonable and plausible interest rate assumptions for fiscal years 1984 through 1989. Currently. the administration is projecting shortterm interest rate levels of 9.1 percent in 1985. 8.1 percent in 1986. 6.7 percent in 1987. 5.5 percent in 1988. and 5 percent in 1989. These interest rate estimates are markedly lower than those projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office which projects shortterm interest rates at 9.7 percent in 1985. 8.9 percent in 1986. 8.9 percent in 1987. and 8.9 percent in 1988 and 1989. Now why should we be concerned with this difference in interest rate assumptions? After all. I am sure that everyone here in this body would like to see lower interest rates now and in the future. Deficits $200 billion for as far as the eye can see is a reality. Who will pay for these deficits is not a secret. it will be our children. This administration has effectively mortgaged our future. The Presidents response to this deficit crisis is one based on personal optimisrp and political convenience. Well. the principal reason that we should be concerned is that these rosy. and I am sad to say. unrealistic interest rate assumptions are - used to reduce deficit projections in the years ahead. According to the Joint Economic Committee. the optimistic interest rate projections embodied in the OMB budget review will reduce the budget deficit by: $7 billion in 1985. $6 billion in 1986. $17 billion in 1987. $53 billion in 1988. and nearly $80 billion in 1989. That means. in total. that deficits will be reduced by nearly $165 billion in the years ahead by the use of what must be regarded as phony interest rate projections. Now there is one way in which the administration is attempting to deal with this serious problem. It is not new or novel. In fact. it has been used skillfully by the administration since day one. It simply involves cooking up phony economic assumptions to make the deficits go away. David Stockman outlined this technique in his interview in the 1981 Atlantic Monthly article. George Bush called it voodoo economics during the 1980 election. What we are now seeing is voodoo economics revisited. Thats not a bad days work for an administration that consistently refuses to face up to the deficit problem. Thats certainly a painless way to reduce the deficit. You dont need to do the hard work to see whether your revenues and taxes are adequate to meet your expenditure needs. You dont need to examine defense spending careful.. and see where you can make reductions without hurting our military preparedness. and you dont need to send forward a balanced program of tax revisions and expenditure reductions that will provide a realistic and equitable means of restoring balance to the budget. All you have to do. apparently. is cook the books. All you have to do is reduce the budget deficit with questionable economic assumptions. Now that. Mr. President. is a painless way to reduce the budget deficit. Now who really agrees with these interest rate assumptions? Well. the Congressional Budget Office certainly does not. The most recent Congressional Budget Office report ol deficit forecasts indicates that and I quote: The principal reason why interest rates should remain so high even as the economy cools down is the high level of Treasury borrowing and the concomitant rapid increase In the outstanding stock of Treasury debt. Mr. Penner. CBO Director. goes on to state further that if deficits are not reduced by realistic then interest rate payments should rise to some 4 percent of GNP by 1989. That means that over 16 percent of all Federal outlays will go for debt service. and public debt will double to a level of $2.5 trillion. In short. unless some hard choices are made on iscal policy. Mr. President. interest rates will not go down. and the administration will be trying once again to paint an unwarranted deficit picture for the American public. The interest rate assumptions contained in the OMB projections have no foundation in economic principle. They are not consistent with the expertise of any economist that I know of. or of any economist that has testified before the Senate Budget Committee. Now what do other economists think about the interest rate situation? Well. the Washington Post reported on August 7. 1984. that most outside economists foresee r. longterm rise in interest rates because of the deficit. Thats what Andrew Brimmer. former Federal Reserve Board member contends. Thats what Allen Sinai. chief economist for American Express contends. Thats Vat most Wall Street economists contenid. And Mr. President. the market itself continues to be worried about rising interest rates. Why on August 6 the average yield on 3 month Treasury Bills was 10.55 percent. the highest level since July of And to remove any further doubt. Mr. President. the homebuilders and realtors associations project either increases in the prime rate or effective mortgage rates of about 1 percent within the next year or so. So. Mr. President. to me the jury is in. These projections are simply implausible and cannot be taken seriously. They should be withdrawn and I urge my colleagues to send this message. that the American people deserve better. The homebuilders and realtors arent betting on interest rates coming down. Paul Volcker and Rudy Penner arent forecasting reduced interest rates. No one is. except the Reagan adminIstration. The United States Senate should not be a party to these phony budget estimates. Rather we should pass this resolution and send a clear message to the administration and the American people that we need a realistic assessment of the budget deficit problem. and then we can take realistic steps to deal with this problem. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that related articles and tables about interest rate projections be included immediately following my remarks.
980254996,"A letter from U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley which appeared in the CoNanESSIONAL RECORD on September 10 deserves further attention here. In that letter. discussion of the nonacquiescence policy prompted Mr. Giuliani to write that: This policy does not allow the United States Attorneys Office. 1111 or any other Federal agency to refuse to follow clear rules of law decided by the United States Court of Appeals. Properly applied. as it has been for years by the Internal Revenue Service. it permits a Federal agency to decline to follow nationwide the ruling in one particular circuit. However. there has never been any support to my knowledge for the notion that Federal agencies within a particular circuit could disagree with and refuse to follow clear rulings of that circuit. We have not defended cases in the past by disregarding the law of this circuit and will not do so in the future."" Now the reason that the issue of disability reform has to this date been placed on the back burner is due to a political decision made by the administration earlier this year to impose a moratorium on all disability reviews. This may be good politics. but it is not good policy. It is clear that there is a perceived problem here or else the White House would never have stopped the illconceived and misinformed policy which effectively has cut more then 470.000 disabled beneficiaries from the rolls between March 1981 and January of this year. Mr. President. I am pleased to hear that final resolution to this problem is imminent. yet. for those of us who have been intensely involved in this issue for the past 2V2 years it is hard to understand why it has taken so long. It is my only hope that the final resolution will contain adequate comprehensive measures to prevent the mistreatment which has occurred over the past 3 years from recurring. Surely. an end to the nonacquiescence policy practiced by the Social Security Administration wfH be a major step toward achieving this goal. Simple justice requires that we correct the inequities created by the Administrations hasty acceleration of reviews. commonsence demands it. It is nice to see that now. finally. Congress is willing to stand up to the Administration and refute the unfairness inherent in its disability policy.e"

970010454,"Mr. President. the administrations proposal to eliminate entirely the national sea grant college program is a budgetary blunder. The reason given by the administration Is totally wrong and mistaken. The budget documents submitted to the Congress today state that the sea grant program should be terminated because it has ""largely achieved [its1 original purpose to develop State and local capability for addressing marine and coastal issues."" As the author of the original sea grant legislation and as one who has conducted every Senate reauthorization and oversight hearing on the program. I know the intent of the Congress was and is that the program be a continued partnership between the Federal Government and State and local interests with each paying a share of the costs. That intention has been made crystally clear by the Congress time and again. I regret that the administration has misstated the purpose of the program to justify its proposal to kill it. The fact is that the sea grant college program is the most costeffective marine resource program we have. A recent compilation by an ad hoc sea grant study group showed the program has produced annual direct economic benefits of more than $200 million. The program is a public investment in technological innovation and increased productivity. The administrations program would kill the sea grant program as of October 1 of this year. It is a decision that could only have been made almost blindly in some frenzied midnight search for budget cuts. I am confident that the Congress. after examining the program in the light of day. will decide that the sea grant program should be continued. In fact. the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. acting yesterday on its fiscal year 1982 budget submission. included $35 million for the sea grant program. That is a budget cut of less than 10 percent. and the funding for the program was supported by the Republican majority as well as the Democratic minority. I support the President in his effort to curb Federal Government spending. and I expect that the sea grant program will bear its share of austerity. but I will vigorously oppose the proposal to kill this program.*"
970016965,Mr. President. I rise in strong support of the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island. my colleague and friend . This amendment. while it does not contain all that I would like to see. contains many strong elements. and to my mind is a minimum of what this Congress should do and what the Senate should do on the message sent to it from downtown. In the different items. he includes lowincome energy assistance. No part of .the Nation needs this more than the Northeast. However. even in the Sunbelt there is need for airconditioning at certain times. In the UDAG program. we will know what is needed there. In the area of rehabilitation. I was disappointed to see our amendment go down in defeat. but I hope this matter will fare better when proposed by the Republican side. We know the impact that the cutbacks will have in health services. housing. weatherization. community development. and mass transit. All of these are vital and essential programs. In the area of energy. annual increases in the cost of home heating have reached levels that the average American can no longer bear. This year $1.85 billion was appropriated and 50 million people have been served. Next year even more families will need protection in order to brace themselves against the economic effect of oil decontrol and the possible deregulation of natural gas. My staff has projected that it would take approximately $2.3 billion to maintain the current levels of assistance. in real terms. I am sad to say that the administration has only proposed $1.35 billion for this program. a full 25 percent less than last year. This means that next year while the price of home energy will be more than 25 percent higher. the elderly. the poor. and moderateincome workers will have their purchasing power under this program eroded by more than 50 percent as a result of the administrations cut combined with inflation and the rising cost of heating oil. And if the Budget Committees reconciliation resolution is approved by the Senate. the news could be even worse for beneficiaries under this program. I have evaluated the Presidents proposals with an open mind. I support the objective of reducing Federal spending but believe the national interest will not be served if those who are most in need bear the brunt of the proposed spending cuts. The State of Rhode Island is at the very end of the energy supply pipeline. It is 84 percent dependent upon foreign
970042394,"Mr. President. we are all well aware that the Reagan administration is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the draft convention of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The intention to undertake such a review was announced by Secretary Haig on March 3. just prior to the opening of the 10th session of the Third Law of the Sea Conference in New York. It is certainly fitting and proper that any new administration undertake such a review. As one who has long been an advocate of establishing an international regime to govern the worlds ocean space. I know that if this goal is to be achieved. there must be a resolution of many complex issues. and this takes time. My own efforts in the Senate to bring such a regime to fruition date back to 1967. At that time. I introduced Senate Resolution 172. which called for the negotiation of a comprehensive multilateral treaty governing all of the military and nonmilitary uses of ocean space. Once again. in 1969. I introduced another Senate resolution. Senate Resolution 33. which not only called for the negotia. tion of a comprehensive treaty but also contained a draft Law of the Sea Treaty. I was partially rewarded for my efforts in 1972. when the U.S. Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of the Seabed Arms Control Treatya treaty to prohibit the emplacement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on or below the seabed floor. As you can see. Mr. President. given the long history of this issue. we need not despair over a few months delay in the negotiations so that the United States can complete its study of the treatyit need not irreparably damage the prospects for a comprehensive LOS treaty. However. I do think that this administration must be careful not to delay too long. lest hardwon gains. achieved during 8 years of negotiations. during the course of three different administrations. may be lost. In this regard. let me call to the attention of my colleagues a very persuasive editorial entitled ""Reagan and the Sea Treaty."" which appeared iii the Boston Globe on I ask that the article be printed in the RECORD."
970096939,"Mr. President. the admin-. Istrations recent announcement concerning the development of the MX missile. the B1 bomber and related systems represents a commitment to the largest single strategic weapons program since the beginning of the nuclear age. I have some deep reservations about the staggering price tag attached to this program and strong doubts about whether the value of the additional security we will supposedly be buying Is worth- the enormous Investment of tax dollars. I am also concerned about the foreign policy and armns control Implications of this deci-. sion. At the outset. let me state that there are several aspects of the Presidents decision which I stronigly support. I r.-s especially heartened by the elimination from consideration of the socalled ""racetrack"" basing mode for the TAX missile. This proposal wouldhave had a devastating effect on the environment in large areas of our Western States. In addition to Its enormous price tag. The Presidents decision to drop the racetrack basing mode makes good sense. and I applaud him for that. I am also encouraged by the Presidents intention. In his announcement. to seek genuine arms reduction with the Soviet Union. Even as we continue to modernize our own strategic forces. we must actively pursue arms reductions. and I am hopeful that the delay of a final decision on the basing mode for the MX missile will open the door to early and constructive discussions with the Soviets on a verifiable new strategii arms limitation treaty and limits on nuclear weapons In Europe. Arms control is a sine qua non of a sane strategic weapons program. because further spending on strategic forces will buy more security only if coupled with limitations on the deployment of such force?. Several aspects of the Presidents program remain very troubling to me. The cost of the planned systems is dangerously high in view of the compelling national interest In bringing down the Federal deficit and eventually balancing the budget. Obviously. at a time when human services programs are being slashed to the marrow. the Congress ought to be skeptical of the need for such an enor. mious expenditure for new strategic weapons. In this connection. I would like to Point out that the announced $180.3 billion price tag for the first 6 Years of the program does not take into account the fact that an ultimate decision on the basing of the MX could add substantially to the total figure. I- also understand that the $180.3billion figure only Includes R. & D. and initial Production during the 8year period: it does not Include the total cost of producing the proposed systems. At bottom. we must ask ourselves how much additional security we are purchasing for such an astonishing cost. We must also ask what the effect of spending so much on new strategic systems will mean for funding badly needed improvements in our conventional forces and for servicing and maintaining existing equipment. There Is no doubt In my mind that Production and modernization of strategic weapons must be part of our national defense effort. I seriously question. however. the wisdom or going ahead with the Bi bomber. when even the Secretary of Defense has conceded that the BI bomber will be able to penetrate Soviet air defenses for only a few years after its deployment in the late eighties. In view of the cost of this Item. is this shot in the arm for the Air Force worth developing when our existing B52s will be able for many years to serve as cruise missile carriers and when an advanced technology or ""Stealth"" bomber will be available in the 1990s? The Congress will have to carefully consider whether the Bi can be Justified on any basis. especially in view of the minimal increment of additional security it will afford. At tihe very least. the Congress needs a better justification for the B4i than it currently has. In regard to the MX. the President has essentially deferred a decision on a basing mode since no one expects the missiles which will initially be based In hardened Titan silos. to close the socalled window of vulnerability permanently. The President has mentioned three basing modes which will be examined: the continuous airborne patrol aircraft. a landbased system protected by a ballistic missile defense system. and deep underground basing. Each of these three options Involves substantial costs and problems. and I would hope that the administration would consider a fourth alternative. one which. in my view. would ultimately be much more costeffective and strategically advantageous: the seabased Trident II missile. The apparent diversity and flexibility of the nuclear Triad continues to have political and other attractions. but may be on the verge of being outdated and unnecessary in terms of the security It provides at such enormous cost. A submarinebased ballistic missile system would be far more costeffectife and certainly far less vulnerable to enemy attack than the proposed MX missile in any landbased mode. I would urge the administration to accelerate development of the Trident II missile and seriously consider the seabased Trident II as an alternative to further development of the MX I also urge the administration to be mindful of the arms control implications of its proposal. in particular the decision to deploy large numbers of nuclear sea-. launched cruise missiles. Since cruise missiles could be deployed on hundreds. if not thousands. of submarines and surface vessels. there would be an immense verification problem that could Jeopardize the possibility of achieving meaningful limitations on these weapons in a newv SALT agreement. If the Soviet Union were to respond with a similar program involving the larger number of submarines and surface ships at their disposal. a major new threat to the United States would arise. Furthermore. a new sealaunched cruise missile program could undermine the present NATO consensus to deploy new landbased theater nuclear weapons in Europe. because the deployment of sealaunched cruise missiles would call into question the need for such landbased weapons. rhe prospects for negotiations With the Warsaw Pact for * mutual limits on theater nuclear deployments In Europe may also be seriously diminished. Mr. President. for all of these reasons I believe that the Congress should be very skeptical about going along with the proposed strategic weapons package in its present form. In particular. it makes no sense to proceed without a firm commitment by the administration to utilize arms control negotiations as a complement to weapons programs in enhancing our national security. These are critical times as we strive to put our economic house in order and preserve the peace. But neither objective will be served If we proceed down the road toward a costly and endless nuclear arms race with the Soviets. Now is the time for the Congress to Insist on a rational and costeffective defense program that emphasizes negotiated restraint as well as new weapons."
970123113,"Madam President. there are many excellentiand long overdue Initiatives in the 1982 Defense appropriations bill before the Senate today. There Is much in this bill that I wholeheartedly support. I have concluded. however. that the overall level of spending in the bill Is so excessive and unjustified by our real military needs that I cannot support final passage of this legislation. This bill would appropriate a single year Increase of 22 percent in our defense budget. from $171 billion in fiscal 1981 to $208 billion In fiscal 1982. The amount contained in the Senate bill Is $11 billion more than approved by the House of Representatives and $8 billion more than December .4. 1981 requested by the President for military spending. I seriously question whether the Pentagon will be able to manage a single year Increase of $37 billion without hasty. wasteful and unwise spending. In my view. $208 billion is an unconscionable level of defense spending unjustified by our present military needs and certain to contribute to the soaring Federal deficit that is at the root of our national economic crisis. My vote against this bill is a reluctant one. because there is much In it that I strongly support. The committee has included $330 million in advance procurement for the Trident submarine program. a level I strongly support and one which I hope wvill be sustained In conference. This long lead funding Is necessary to maintain the production of Tridents at the steady rate advocated by President Reagan. The Tridents are the most survivable and effective nuclear submarines ever built and I believe the committee hans acted commendably In providing an adequate level of advance procurement funding in the absence of an authorization for the ninth and tenth Tridents. Of particular Importance to the future of the Trident program Is the $239 million in the bill for research and development of the Trident II missile. I have previously urged the administration to accelerate the development of the Trident II and to consider a seabased Trident ir as an alternative to further development of the MX. The Trident program Is critical to our future national security. yet it should be noted that the amount of funding for the Trident program is less than 1 percent of the overall total of this bill. The bill also contains $953 million for the construction of two additional SSN688 Los Angeics class submarines. The continued production of attack submarines at the rate of two per year is strongly in our national defense interest. and I support this extremely important naval procurement. I especially commend the committee for Its inclusion of $300 million to supplement the capital Improvements program of the Coast Guard. This initiative is a welcome recognition of the Coast Guards role as member of our Armed Forces. This money will enable the Coast Guard to procure the vessels. aircraft and other equipment desperately needed to permit satisfactory performance of the enormously widespread military and civilian role the Congress has given to our ""second Navy."" There are many other elements in the bill directed at conventional force modernization and Improved readiness capability that are commendable and long overdue. The bill. however. Is weighted down by more than $3.7 billion for the purchase of B1 bombers .and developmnent of the M.X missile. Both of these programs. in my view. are unjustifiable because of their immense long range costs and marginal addition to our national security. The value of the additional security we will supposedly be buying .is not. In my judgment. equal to the enormous long term investment of tax dollars. For these reasons. I have decided to oppose passage of this appropriations bill. There is much that is good in it and I am as mindful as any other Member of this body of the need for significant real growth in the defense budget. This bill. however. goes well beyond what is necessary for readiness to meet the current military threat. and for modernization of our conventional and strategic forces. A 22percent in defense spending Is foolhardy In light of the economic realities that confront us and is not a sane economic or military course for our country to follow. Two weeks ago. the President vetoed a continuing appropriations resolution because it provided about $2 billion more in spending than he had requested for the entire Government. We are today acting on a single appropriations bill that Is $8 billion above the amount requested by the President for one department of Government. If ever a bill were a budgetbuster. this Is it. This appropriations bill now must be acted on by a HouseSenate confererice committee. I hope the conference committee will produce a bill that provides the increased funds really needed for a sound national defense. without the excessive budgetbusting increases included in the bill now before the Senate."
970153723,Mr. President. community service employment under the Older Americans Act. known as title V. has meant dignity. meaning. a modest increase in income. and appreciation by their communities for hundreds of Rhode Island senior citizens. and for thousands of other older Americans throughout the country. Approximately 300 Rhode Islands 55 and over are currently able to work in parttime jobs because of this valuable program. Under the administrations proposed budget for fiscal year 1983. all 300 of those Rhode Islanders will lose their employment. Despite the 3year reauthorization of the program recently passed by Congress and signed by the President. the administration plans to eliminate funding for title V in the coming fiscal year. Since the administration announced its proposed budget for the next fiscal year. hundreds of Rhode Islanders have written to tell me of their support for this program. Senior citizens who have been employed through the program. their friends and relatives. and the community agencies that have benefitted from their services have all written. They have told me that this is a program which has provided invaluable skills and experience .to public agencies. and has provided invaluable commitment. meaning. and supple. mental income to our senior citizens. The agencies which have benefitted from seniors assistance under title V perform a wide variety of services in Rhode Island. The Providence Police Department. the Providence Public Library. the Rhode Island Division of Personnel. the Rhode Island Department of State Library Services. and the Providence Housing Authority have each written to me to tell me how valuable their senior citizen aides have been. Senior citizen centers. community centers. childrens homes. and nursing homes have also expressed their concern about the termination of funding which the administration proposes. Our seniors have brought a wealth of khowledge and experience to this agency which we could not afford through regular budgetary meansIs the comment of one agency head. and his comment is typical of others. These employees have filled strategic positions in the operations of this department * * *. Over the years. these workers have been diligent in their performance of duty and have provided services which are vital to the operation of this departmentIs another voice of support. The letters of senior aides who are employed by this program are particularly compelling. One woman. Willa May Waldon of Woonsocket. R.I.. is 69 years old and works as an assistant cook in a Head Start and day care program. She writes: Before I went to work there I was feeling nervous. depressed. and very lonesome. I do not want to go back to that way of life. I also worried how I could pay my bills and buy food. My job gives me the added income so I no longer have to worry each day how I will live. I can now pay my rent and bills and still have enough money to take the bus and buy food. Please do not cut this program. it is very special to me. I feel like a new person since Ive taken this job. Ms. Waldons statement is eloquent. but the thoughts that she expresses are common to almost all of the letters that I have receieved from senior citizens on this proposed change. Mr. President. community service employment for older Americans was first funded in 1965. In the 198182 program year. there are 54.216 positions funded at $277.1 million. Throughout the history of the program. it has received nothing but praise and gratitude. It is a program worthy of the strongest support. Congress and the President have given that support by authorizing title V for another 3 years. The administrations proposal to cease funding title V. only months after the new authorization has been signed into law. makes a mockery of that commitment. It is a mockery especially in view of our high rate of unemployment. which means seniors will have more difficulty than ever in finding employment. and in view of other services for seniors which the administration has reduced or eliminated. I call on my colleagues to join with me in opposing any attempt to reduce funding for the valuable title V program.
970163735,Mr. President. I rise in strong support of S. 2158a tough. realistic bill aimed at controlling our Nations No. 1 highway safety problem the drunk driver. If ever there was a problem national in scope. and crying out for congressional attention. it is drunk driving. Each year. these accidents snuff out the lives of over 25.000 of our fellow Americans. An additional 125.000 persons annually are permanently disabled In drunk driver accidents. and 650.000 others are seriously injured. At hearings before the Commerce Committee In March. witnesses estimated that the economic cost of these accidentsannuallyadds up to $17 billion. There is no doubt that the American people want stronger laws to punish drunk drivers. A recent survey in the Christian Science Monitor indicated that 33 State legislatures are presently considering bills to toughen enforcement of drunk driver laws. Local law enforcement is clearly the first line of defense against drunk drivers. Our job as Federal legislators is to provide the tools that will enable local law enforcement officials to keep these potential killers off our highways. S. 2158 provides a strong incentive to the States to mount an allout. comprehensive attack on the drunk driver menace. Title I of the bill established an incentive grant program for the States that enact a comprehensive drunk driver statute. States that adopt the bills provisions for automatic license suspension. mandatory jail sentences for repeat offenders. alcohol treatment programs. and improved enforcement of drunk driver laws will automatically qualify for additional highway safety funding to carry out the comprehensive program. Title 11 of the bill authorizes funding for the upgrading and computerization of the National Driver Register. The NDR is operated by the Department of Transportation to help the States identify drivers with a history of serious traffic offenses. Presently. inquiries from the States are handled manually. with responses delayed for so long that the number of States making use of the NDR is declining. 8. 2158 will give local officials an effective weapon to keep bad drivers off the highwaysby providing immediate electronic access to and referral of information by the National Driver Register. The additional highway safety funding authorized by this bill. Mr. President. is insignificant compared to the loss of life. family tragedy. and health impairment we presently live with and pay for as a society. Legislation alone. of course. is not the whole answer. Drunk driving will never disappear entirely. until public attitudes and outrage demand an end to it. What this bill will do is strongly reinforce efforts already underway in most States to increase the penalties for drunk drivers. andmost criticallyget them off our highways through a combination of better law enforcement and automatic license suspension. I commend the leadership of Senator DANFORTH. who has successfully guided this bill to the floor in just under 6 weeks since the introduction of S. 2158. He has domonstrated outstanding leadership in this effort. and it has been a pleasure to work with him in developing this legislation. I also commend my own State of Rhode Island. which is very close to being one of the first States to adopt a comprehensive drunk driver law identical to S. 2158. Governor Garrahy has steered his tough drunk driver bill through the Rhode Island House. and Senate consideration of the bill is expected to take place w:ithin a few days. Hopefully many other States will quickly follow Rhode Islands lead and enact the model law contained in the bill before the Senate today. Finally. I congratulate my aide Bradford Penney on all his fine work in moving this legislation along to passage. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Senator CHAFEE. Senator RAINGLPH. Senator MITCHELL. Senator BRADLEY. Senator LEAHY. and Senator MATSUNAGA be added as cosponsors to this legislation.
970163996,"Mr. President. I rise today to express my concern about certain aspects of the Reagan administrations China policy. Along with many of my colleagues. I fully supported the normalization of relations between the United States and the Peoples Republic of China achieved by President Carter in 1979. I also approve in principle President Reagans efforts to achieve further improvements in the United StatesPeoples Republic of China relationship. But I believe it is most inappropriate to seek these improvements by encouraging the Peoples Republic of China to think that we support Taiwans reunification with mainland China. Such an approach disregards the hopes and aspirations of the Taiwanese people. Hopefully. Vice President Busu did nt t discuss this issue when he met with Chinese leaders late last week. My concern for the people on Taiwan dates back to World War II days. In anticipation of an American invasion of Formosa. as it Was then called. I studied at Columbia University in a Governmentsponsored program to prepare a contingent of Americans to participate in the eventual administration of the island once it had been wrested from Japanese control. As part of this training. we studied the history of Formosa and its people. the Native Taiwanese who have lived on the island for some hundreds of years. Although the people originally emigrated from China. by the 1940s they saw themselves as a separate nation and desperately wanted to be independent from both Japan and China. Today. the native Talwanesethe nearly 16 million pre1949 inhabitants of the island. who are ruled by the some 2 million Chinese that set up the nationalist government headquarters on Taiwan after 1949do not often agree with the Kuomintang (KMT) policies. For over 30 years they have been excluded from the national level decisionmaking process. and until recently given little control over even their local affairs. As you know. the KMT purports to represent all China and considers Taiwan only one of its provinces. The authorities view denands for greater political participation as endangering its national ideology and undermining its pledges to ""return to the mainland"" someday. Taiwanese who press the issuepoliticans. journalists. religious leaders. and educatorsoften find themselves in jail charged with subversion. The United States long ago acknowledged that both the PRC and the ROC agreed that there was but one China. and that Taiwan was an integral part of it. We have never. however. recognized this claim and for good reason. We believe that neither the native Taiwanese nor their KMT rulers want reunification dictated to them. In fact. the native Taiwanese. if given a real choiceone without fear of reprisalwould overwhelmingly choose an independent Taiwan. Admittedly. a declaration of independence at this moment could prove counterproductive and jeopardize the native Taiwaneses safety and wellbeing. But that does not mean that the U.S. Government should do anything which would encourage any of the mainland Chinese. in either Beijing or Taipei. to believe that we support ""reunification"" now or ever. Unfortunately. this Is exactly what the Reagan administration appears intent on accomplishing. Last November a New York Times article indicated that Secretary Haig. during a questionandanswer period in Florida: Seemed to acknowledge Pekings complaint that. by continuing to supply arms to the nationalists. the United States was undermining efforts at reunification. The article goes on to quote Secretary Haigs comments on a ninepoint PRC proposal for reunification which he characterized as ""rather remarkable."" The Secretary also said that. The Chinese call for peaceful integirtion. they recognize Federalism In Taipei and their ability to maintain their own political. economic and security framework. . . so these were not meaningless proposals. Another report. this time in the Los Angeles Times. purportedly based on a November memorandum from Secretary Haig to the President. also suggests that the administration sanctions Taiwans reunification with the mainland. In discussing arms sales to Taiwan. and the FX aircraft decision. the Secretary apparently wrote: We must recognize that mainland capabilities and intentions do not require a level of U.S. arms sales above the final year of the Carter administration. which provided an unusually high ceiling. We can agree to stay within this level. so long as Peking pursues a peaceful Taiwan policy. We can also decide the replacement rircraft issue in this context. Second. while we cannot specify a time certain for ending arms sales.. we can dwelop formulation linking our future actions to genuine progress on peaceful reunification. I believe we should oppose such suggestions which tend to close out the option for Taiwanese selfdetermina. tion. and would prohibit them from some sort of independent course. I again urge that all talk of reunification cease. Even if the executive branch is not prepared to promote native Taiwanese interests and concerns. it can at least remain neutral on the question and avoid seeming to support Chinas sovereignty over the Island. Mr. President. I ask that the two press articles to which I referred to earlier be printed in full at this point In the RECORD. The articles follow: (From the New York Times. Nov. 15. 1981]"
970213487,"Mr. President. 7 years ago yesterday. the leaders of 35 nationsthe United States. Canada. the Soviet Union and every European nation except Albaniamet In the Finnish capital of Helsinki to affix their signatures on a document which set standards for the conduct of behavior among those nations. This historic eventthe signing of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in EuropeCSCEwas the culmination of nearly 2 years of negotiations and marked a high point in the era of detente. Seven years later. with d6tente an unfashionable word and the bilateral relationship between the two superpowers in shambles. some question the relevancy of the Helsinki Final Act and the series of meetings and consultations that have become known as the CSCE process. Yet. it Is precisely during periods of tension such as these that the principles embodied in the Helsinki agreement become even more significant. For the Helsinki Final Act provides the foundation for lasting peace. genuine security. and increased cooperation among the nations of Europe and North America. That structure will not be built. however. unless and until the Soviet Union begins abiding by its commitments. As a founding member of the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand the expectations of the people of EuropeEast and WestChat were generated by the signing of the Helsinki accord. Those expectations have not yet been fully realized and. tragically. in some cases. those hopes have been dashed completely. Yet. the Helsinki process offers the best chance for reducing the misunderstanding and stress that has marked EastWest relations in recent years and for improving the lot of the people of all 35 nations. While the Helsinki Final Act covers nearly every aspect of EastWest relationsmilitary security. trade and economic cooperation. scientific and cultural exchangethe provisions that have received the most attention in the West and. sadly. the least implementation in the East. are those dealing with human rights and humanitarIan issues. The 35 signatories agreed to respect human rights. to facilitate the freer movement of people. especially for family reunification and binational marriage. to disseminate information of all kinds. and to guarantee religious freedom. Instead. the Soviet Government .imprisons human rights activists. denies Jews and others the right to join their relatives abroad. forces spouses to undergo lifethreatening fasts in order to be reunited with their loved ones. Jams Western radio broadcasts. and severely restricts the exercise of religious rights. Many of the Warsaw Pact nationsespecially ( choslovakia. East Germany and. now. Polandhave followed the Soviet example of repression. Continued Soviet and Eastern disregard for their Helsinki obligations can only result in a further deterioration of our relations. That message must be deliveredforcefully and continuallyto the Soviet authorities at every level of our dealings with them. American actions and rhetoric must make it clear. that we consider respect for human rights to be an integral element in the improvement of relations and in the establishment and maintenance of genuine security in Europe and throughout the world. The Helsinki Final Act itself recognizes that respect for human rights ""is an essential factor for the peace. justice and wellbeing necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations"" among all countiles. We must hold the Soviets to those words.e"
970247843,"Mr. President. on Tues. day. September 21. a very important event took place on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. The U.S. Section of the Womens International League f3r Peace and Freedom in conjunction with other American womens organizations held a press conference to reaffirm the strong commitment of American women to peace and to express their determination to halt the nuclear arms race. Also participating were two Members of the House. Congresswomen SCHNEIDER and SCHROEDER. For many years women have played a vital role in the pursuit of peace. During World War I. over 1.000 women participated in an International Womens Congress at The Hague. These women sought to put pressure on the alliance and entente powers. which did not sanction the Congress. to bring the war to an end. The Womens International League for Peace and Freedom was born out of the womens movement to end World War I. The league. which is organized in 25 countries and more than 100 American cities and towns. has a long tradition of working for peace and world disarmament. For example. league members were strong advocates of a ban on above ground nuclear testing as well as outspoken opponents of the Vietnam war. In March of this year. the league launched STARa yearlong campaign to register 1 million American women to stop the arms race. Through STAR. American women are not only showing their support but also presenting their demands for a SovietAmerican nuclear weapons freeze. a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and other measures designed to bring the arms race to an end. In recent months other American womens organizations have joined the league in the quest for world peace. Many of these organizations developed out of the concern that has been growing in the United States about nuclear wara concern which I share. Peace LinksWomen Against Nuclear War was founded early this year by Mrs. Betty Bumpers. the wife of our distinguished colleague from Arkansas. Thanks to the dedication of Mrs. Bumpers. Peace Links has evolved from a core of 35 women in Arkansas to a national effort. By working through traditional community groups and State chapters. Peace Links educates American women and their families about nuclear issues and helps them to make their voices heard. Womens Action for Nuclear Disarmament (WAND). founded by Dr. Helen Caldicott. has an active network of women and men working in more than 70 affiliate groups across the United States. Members of WAND. like members of the league. Peace Links. and the National Womens Political Caucus. are especially active in the nuclear freeze campaign. As the first U.S. Senator to support the freeze proposal. in November 1981. and as a cosponsor of the KennedyHatfield resolution calling for an immediate freeze to be followed by substantial reductions of nuclear weapons. I am delighted that American women strongly support the freeze. In my view the freeze is the first and most crucial step in curbing the nuclear arms race and reducing the risk of nuclear war. In testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee last November. Gen. David C. Jones. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. told me that an allout nuclear war ""would be the greatest catastrophe in history of many orders of magnitude."" American women. like their counterparts in Europe and the Soviet Union. recognize the dangers of nuclear war and are desperately trying to wirn us that we must. take action now to avoid the impending disaster. I believe that it is our duty and our moral responsibility to heed these warnings. Indeed. we can afford to do no less. A nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union would bring an end to our society as we know it and. in the words of Jonathan Schell. create ""an abyss in which all human purposes would be drowned for all time."" Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the women of the United States for their invaluable contributions to the cause of peace."

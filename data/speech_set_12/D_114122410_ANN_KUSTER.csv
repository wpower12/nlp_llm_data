1140004946,Thank you. Judge POE. and to my dear colleague. ANN WAGNER. and to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for tackling this issue. I am proud to join my colleagues in passing these six commonsense bills which I have pushed for across the aisle to strengthen protections for victims of sex trafficking. and Judge POE has done a great job setting the stage here for the child who is the victim of sex trafficking. I think we all need to work on our language and our understanding. He is absolutely correct. I look forward to passing more of these reforms tomorrow and to continuing our bipartisan work together. It saddens and astonishes me that in todays world. human trafficking remains such a serious problem both here at home and abroad. Throughout the world. thousands of women and underage children are being trafficked and forced to commit sexual acts against their will. As Judge POE so eloquently stated. rape. that is what we are talking about. It is sickening that individuals advertise and promote this heinous practice in order to make a quick profit. Representative WAGNERS legislation. the SAVE Act. which I helped to cointroduce. would penalize individuals who knowingly host and sell advertisements for the commercial exploitation of minors and trafficking victims. Last Congress. as she eloquently stated. I was very proud to reach across the aisle and join Representative WAGNER to lead all House womenevery single House woman Member. Republican and Democratin urging the Obama administration to push the United Nations Security Council to add Boko Haram to the AlQaida Sanctions List. following the abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls threatened to be sold into sexual slavery by this terrorist group. The horrific kidnapping of the female Nigerian school students captured the worlds shock and horror. however. human trafficking is not just a foreign issue. Together. we can be a powerful bipartisan voice against the horrors of this and other instances of human trafficking. Both Democrats and Republicans in the House understand the importance of working together to protect women and girls. and they know that trafficking isnt just a political issue. it is a human issue. I have organized discussions on this topic back home in New Hampshire where I have heard from community leaders. law enforcement officials. academic researchers. advocates. andmost importantly and. frankly. most eloquentlythe trafficking victims themselves about the ongoing occurrence of human and sex trafficking taking place right here in our own backyard. Domestic child sex trafficking is a serious problem in the United States. with an estimated 293.000 American youth at risk of commercial sex trafficking and exploitation. It is imperative that we pass these bills to help law enforcement rescue domestic victims. track down their exploiters. provide additional tools for prosecutors to treat trafficked minors as victims instead of criminals. and ensure access to protective services. Again. I commend Judge POE for his eloquent description. I applaud the House leadership for bringing to a vote these bipartisan bills to prevent trafficking and provide support to victims. As a mother. I honestly cannot even imagine the anguish and the pain that these families go through as they fight to bring their loved ones back home. It is essential that we pass these bills and. moving forward. that we do everything together to support States and countries efforts to eliminate human trafficking. Thank you. Representative WAGNER. and to all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for organizing this worthy effort.
1140020137,Mr. Speaker. this is the final amendment to the bill. which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. Mr. Speaker. I would first like to commend Congressman PITTENGER and Congressman HECK for their tireless work on this bill. The three of us arrived in Congress at the same time. just over 2 years ago. as part of a very large freshman class. Republicans and Democrats alike. we were all sent here by constituents frustrated with the gridlock and partisanship who want their Representatives to work together to solve problems. In that spirit. I appreciate the bipartisan work that went into this bill. which addresses a noble goal: ensuring that the voices of small businesses are heard by Federal regulators making important decisions across our entire economy. I share that goal. Indeed. I have worked across the aisle to bring regulators like the FDA and the SBA to my district in New Hampshire to ensure that they listen to our small businesses and family farmers. Unfortunately. this bill before us today falls short of what our constituents expect and deserve. and contains a lastminute. partisan amendment to undermine funding for consumer protection. Regardless of ones position on the bill. however. I believe we should all work together to improve it. Thus. I offer this amendment to help protect veterans and military servicemembers from unscrupulous business practices. This bill authorizes several advisory boards to ensure that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau consults with small businesses and community financial institutions. My amendment is straightforward. simply stating that no person shall be eligible to serve on a CFPB advisory board if they or their company has committed unfair. abusive. or deceptive business practices against veterans or military families. We can all agree that men and women in uniform should not have their homes foreclosed. their cars repossessed. or their families evicted when they are fighting overseas to protect our freedom. Likewise. military families should not be targeted by predatory interest rates and other abusive lending practices. That is not just wrong. it is illegal. My amendment is straightforward. If a business violates protections for military families. they should not have a seat at the table when new rules are being written for the financial services industry. This amendment is proveteran. It supports our military families. And it makes sense. So. I ask all of us. Republicans and Democrats. to support this amendment. Send a message to our veterans. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140042184,Mr. GARAMENDI. I appreciate you yielding. and I appreciate you taking the time to share with the American people our Make It In America agenda. I really want to thank you for the fantastic work that you have been doing on growing domestic manufacturing in the country. We are joined by our wonderful leader. Mr. STENY HOYER. and his leadership on this issue is now legendary. So thank you for that. New Hampshire has had a long history of being a leader in the manufacturing industry. all the way back to the paper mills at the turn of the century. the textile mills. At one point in Manchester. New Hampshire. we made a mile of cloth a day. and we were leaders in that. So from the beginning of the time that I have served here in Congress. I have been highly focused on how we can support successful local businesses and embrace innovation to help move our manufacturing economy into the 21st century. In New Hampshire and across the country. we have some of the hardest working and most innovative companies in the world. I have had the opportunity to visit dozens of companies in my congressional district. visiting manufacturing companies. community colleges. community groups. and organizations all across the Granite State that are harnessing these new technologies to revitalize the manufacturing sector and breathe new life into our industry. In Keene. New Hampshire. in the southwest corner of my district. for example. we have a Regional Center for Advanced Manufacturing. bringing together leaders from the community. from the K12 school unit there. public schools. from our community collegeRiver Valley Community Collegeour State university systemKeene State Universityand students and leaders from all across the region learning and teaching the trades of tomorrow. Coming up in October. New Hampshire will celebrate a full Manufacturing Week. It is a fabulous program. It started out 1 day. it has now exploded into a whole week. Hundreds. if not thousands. of students from the high schools will come into our manufacturing companies and will have a chance to see firsthand what this looks like. these CNC machines and the computerized precision manufacturing. This is not your grandfathers factory. It is not dirty. It is not noisy. In fact. it is pristine clean. The machines are run on computerized programming. and every employee in the company needs to have the latest in education and talent. People will be able to come in to the companies and see what the work is that is going on. I have had the chance to see the CNC computerized machines working with wood. working with textiles. working in glass. even counting and organizing eggs at a wonderful Pete and Gerrys Organic Eggs farm. The problem is that. during the last several decades. lower wages. lack of access to education and skill training. and changes in our global economy have stacked the deck against our U.S. manufacturers. These issues are standing in the way of innovation. So that is why we have all come together with this Make It In America agenda: to make the right policy changes to help level the playing field so that our manufacturers can grow and successfully create more jobs. That is my number one priority: jobs and economic development. As part of the Make It In America agenda that I am supporting. we have developed a strong. comprehensive plan to help manufacturers thrive in the 21st century. The great thing about manufacturing. as my good colleague. Mr. GARAMENDI. has pointed out. is whether you are working on transportation policy. education. taxes. regulatory issues. trade. or most any other issue. we can take actions that help manufacturers. And that is exactly what our Make It In America agenda is seeking to do. One bill that I introducedand I am working hard to include it in the agenda. and I am working hard to passis the Workforce Development Investment Act. What this important piece of legislation would do is create a tax break for employers who partner with community colleges to provide skill training for specific jobs in their respective industries. As I go around visiting these companies. they do have jobs available. but they dont always have people in the community with the skills that they need. And so. for example. at Nashua Community College. we got funding to create a new program that would train people in this advanced manufacturing. precision manufacturing computerized techniques. and those people will come out with a 2year associates degree and walk directly into jobs at $55.000 with great benefits and a great quality of life right there in New Hampshire. My legislation would do all of this by encouraging greater collaboration between community colleges and employers to make sure that students not only have the right skills to succeed. but are on a path to employment when they graduate. So again. I thank Mr. HOYER. Mr. GARAMENDI. and everyone else who has worked to shape this strong manufacturing agenda. I am proud to be a part of it.
1140065295,I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of my motion that will instruct conferees to include in the conference report language to combat currency manipulation from the Senatepassed version of H.R. 644. Currency manipulation by foreign governments is one of the greatest challenges we face to creating the type of free and fair trade that will benefit all Americans from top to bottom and help us create more jobs right here at home. I. like so many others. am highly focused on helping our domestic manufacturers grow and create good. strong. middle class jobs. Since taking office. I have made supporting job creation and economic opportunity my number one priority. and our States manufacturers play an integral role in that conversation. Unfortunately. U.S. manufacturers already face so many challenges that make it more difficult to compete with foreign companies. From the lower cost of labor to limited environmental protections. our manufacturers must compete with foreign policies that lead to an uneven playing field. Unfair currency manipulation makes that competition even more difficult. Currency manipulation is when governments use monetary policy to devalue their currency. which makes their exports cheaper and foreign imports more expensive. The good news is that we have the most talented workers and the most innovative companies in the world. and we can compete and win despite these challenges. For example. right in my district in New Hampshire. I visited dozens of new manufacturing companies that are harnessing cuttingedge technologies. like precision manufacturing and healthcare technology. to revitalize the industry and create modern. 21st century jobs for our workers. We must support these American manufacturers by cracking down on unfair advantages overseas that hinder their success. This motion will help to level the playing field for manufacturers in New Hampshire and across the country by directing the Department of Commerce to slap duties on goods that have unfairly benefited from undervalued currency. This is the only provision in either customs bill that will effectively deter currency manipulation by our trading partners. Working to address currency devaluation has long enjoyed bipartisan support. In 2010. the House overwhelmingly passed legislation restricting currency manipulation by a vote of 34879. Earlier this year. the Senate version of this legislation passed 7820. in large part because of the critical language restricting currency manipulation. However. the version of this legislation passed by the House does not include the bipartisan provision that so many agree is crucial for limiting the ability of U.S. workers and businesses to compete more fairly with foreign companies and workers. I strongly support fair and open trade that will spur job creation back here in the United States. When 95 percent of global consumers exist outside the United States. we have to find new markets for our manufacturers and other producers to grow and create more jobs here at home. But when U.S. manufacturers are already disadvantaged by foreign products that are subsidized by their home currency. it is difficult for them to compete both at home and abroad. And the impacts of this unfair manipulation are real. The Peterson Institute estimates that. over the past decade. at least 1 million and as many as 5 million jobs have been lost due to currency manipulation. Additionally. an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute estimates that by eliminating currency manipulation we can reduce our trade deficit by as much as $500 billion. leading to a substantial increase in GDP growth and helping our American economy thrive. Specifically. New Hampshire could expect to see roughly 13.000 new jobs as a result of an effective policy against currency manipulation. The status quo is simply not good enough for U.S. workers. and that is why I am offering this motion today. Our workers are already competing with foreign companies that pay their employees a fraction of what U.S. workers make. We should do whatever we can to help make it less difficult for U.S. companies to compete globally. Adding this currency manipulation language to the bill before us today will give us the best chance to do that. Please join me in supporting my motion in support of American manufacturers. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140071329,"Mr. Speaker. this evening I rise as the cochair of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic to call upon my colleagues to refocus our efforts on bringing an end to the opioid epidemic that continues to threaten communities all across New Hampshire and across this country. The opioid epidemic has grown to historic proportions. Our medical providers are struggling to keep up with the flow of overdoses entering our clinics and to secure treatment for those who need it. Our law enforcement. as first responders. have taken on the burden of responding to more and more potentially dangerous situations when a call for help comes in. and these calls are becoming more and more frequent. Statistics now show that more Americans die from drug overdoses than do in car crashes in this country. In my home State of New Hampshire. the opioid epidemic continues to grow. In 2015 alone. the total number of drug deaths in the Granite State exceeded 400. more than one per day. far surpassing the current record of fatalities set just last year at 324. There is no doubt that these numbers are staggering. But behind each and every one of these numbers is a daughter or a son. a mother or a father. a community leader or a neighbor whose life was precious and whose death has inflicted terrible pain on loved ones. For every life lost. there are also many more individuals and families whose lives have been forever changed by opioid misuse. We must never forget or overlook what each number represents. As the epidemic has continued to infiltrate communities across New Hampshire and New England. experts and advocates have risen to challenge opioid abuse in a number of important ways and sometimes from unexpected places. My dear friend Kriss and I have known each other for years now. and she has taken it upon herself to be a champion of this issue. Through her unique position as a premier cosmetologist in the State and the makeup artist of choice for many of the Presidential candidates that pass through New Hampshire during primary season. Kriss has forced a conversation about the need to end the opioid epidemic onto the national stage. Kriss has emerged as a leader on the issue back home. and she and her husband. Mark. continue to display remarkable courage and strength as she shares the story of her stepdaughter. Amber. who is with me here today in this Chamber. who lost her life to a heroin overdose. Kriss hope is that her experience might help and enact real change. So with Kriss and Marks blessing tonight. it is my honor to share Ambers story with you. As Kriss puts it. Amber was the girl who helped everyone else. But. tragically. she could not help herself once she took that first drug at the young age of 15. As Ambers stepmother. Kriss came into her life when she turned 17. At that point. Amber had already passed through the gateway drugs of overthecounter Benadryl. marijuana. alcohol. and prescription opiates that were available on the streets. She suffered from untreated bipolar disorder. but she did not have access to the appropriate medication and. like so many others. was left uncomfortable in her own skin. selfprescribing medication to find relief. In Kriss words. Amber was a girl hard to catch. She chose ""life on the run."" When she found herself living on the streets. she would help others by giving them the coat off her back. panhandling to buy food. or helping others as they detoxed from heroin while homeless. By age 20. she took her first hit of heroin and became spellbound by it. It made choices for her. She had the opportunity to have a loving home. an education. and parents that could support her recovery. but her addiction led her to a life of homelessness on the streets of Manchester. New Hampshire. After four incarcerations in the last 2 years of her life for heroin possession and prostitution. she was a victim of trafficking on the streets of Manchester to maintain her high. When incarcerated and craving treatment. a bed finally became available for Amber at a wonderful treatment center in New Hampshire. but. meanwhile. the prison would not let her out. The prison itself offered no recovery. When she was released. the bed was no longer available. Amber even had to lie to the emergency room to get help by saying. ""I want to kill myself."" She detoxed in that hospital. but no recovery aftercare was available. Kriss and her husband. Mark. brought Amber home. and on the third night. she fled home leaving them a note that said. ""I have to go back to my people."" The last time that Kriss and Mark saw her was Easter Sunday. She was high. vacant. and the drug had consumed her soul. Three days later she was found in an alley dead of a heroin overdose. She was 22 years old. Her death would be easy to blame on institutional failure to ensure that those in need can access resources or on a general lack of empathy for individuals crippled by addiction. Kriss and Mark have made a conscious effort to use Ambers life. her death. and her ongoing vibrant spirit to wake up the hearts and minds of those who have the power to change fate. Tonight. I share Ambers heartwrenching story in the hopes that we can all recognize opioid abuse is not a disease singular to a certain socioeconomic group or race or region. It can take hold of anyone. Ambers parents have been incredibly brave to share her story and to come to Washington to push for reform. We need to erase the stigma from substance abuse disorder. and we need to be far more honest and productive considering the effect on daughters or sons. mothers or fathers. That is why tonight we called our colleagues together for this Special Order so that we can speak from both sides of the aisle and share the lives of friends and loved ones. It is my intention that by honoring those we have lost and by acknowledging the complexities of opioid abuse and the human lives that are behind these fatalities. we can come together to convey the urgency behind bringing an end to the opioid epidemic. I yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire ."
1140090545,"Mr. Speaker. I thank all my colleagues for the bipartisan work that is happening this week. I am proud to be a cochair with the gentleman from New Hampshire of the Bipartisan Taskforce to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. Members of Congress from all across the country coming together to address this crisis. I rise. however. to oppose the rule and. as Mr. MCGOVERN has said. we intend to move the previous question. I am bringing to the House floor a Democratic substitute opioids package to include $600 million in critical funding to address this opioid epidemic. We have an emergency. People are dying. as Mr. GUINTA saidin my own State. our State of New Hampshire. over 420 people in 1 year. We have a better chance in New Hampshire of dying from an opioid epidemic death from fentanyl. from heroin. from drugs off the street. than we do of dying in a car accident. This is an emergency. and it is a crisis. My substitute bill will provide vital funding for all of the bills that we are discussing. for bills that will provide the grants the Committee on the Judiciary has brought forth in H.R. 5046. introduced by Mr. SENSENERENNER. for law enforcement. for drug courts. I have just this week been to the graduation of a drug court. We can turn lives around. but we need funding for drug courts to spread all across our country. for the good work that my colleagues. the gentlewoman from Indiana and the gentleman from Massachusetts . put into the Energy and Commerce bill. H.R. 4641. to create the task force. Mr. GUINTA and I had an original bill. the STOP ABUSE Act. that created a task force. and we are so pleased that that task force will move forward. We need to bring together the experts to determine why now. what is happening in our society that opioid overdoses are leading people. leading this addiction. this substance use disorder that is a disease. leading people to go from prescribed medication from their physician into heroin off the streets and. in our State. is now being laced with fentanyl. which is a lethal combination. The substitute will provide a total of $600 million in vital new resources to address this epidemic. and my understanding is that we have not included this funding in these underlying bills. We want to support the underlying bills. but it is critical to have the funding. New Hampshire has now gone from number 24 in the Nation in deaths per population to number 3. seemingly overnight. I have traveled around my district bringing together stakeholders. law enforcement. treatment providers. longterm recovery. which is a critical aspect of this. physicians. hospitals. police. everyone to the table. In Keene. in Nashua. in Concord. in the north country of our State. we now have mayors committees. We have the Governor having a major summit this week. Here is the answer: we have solutions. I serve on the Committee on Veterans Affairs. and I was so proud to bring to one of our congressional task force hearings Dr. Julie Franklin from the VA in White River Junction. Vermont. who is doing critical frontline research with people. veterans who are experiencing chronic pain. This is lifelong pain. She has worked with them with acupuncture. with mental health treatment. with physical therapy. with all different kinds of wellness and yoga. and she has decreased the use of opiate medication by 50 percent. We can do this. but we need funding. I urge you to vote ""no"" on the rule. I ask my colleagues to please support the substitute package that will include a critical $600 million in funding."
1140090680,Mr. Chairman. the underlying bill before us authorizes the creation of an interagency task force to combat the opiate epidemic. I want to commend the gentlewoman from Indiana and the gentleman from Massachusetts for their hard work on this issue. This important legislation will make it easier to tackle this crisis in a holistic way that addresses all angles of the crisis. including law enforcement. education and prevention. and. most importantly. treatment and lifelong recovery. I thank Congresswoman BROOKS and Congressman KENNEDY for their great work on this bill. as well as the leadership of the chair and the ranking member. In fact. a similar provision to this legislation was included in the STOP ABUSE Act that I introduced with my colleague. Mr. GUINTA. last year. Today he has joined me in introducing this important bipartisan amendment that will further improve the scope of the task forces effort. In New Hampshire and across the country. four out of every five heroin users started out misusing prescription opioid medication. Last year more than 25.000 people died across this country from overdoses on prescription drugs. There are complex reasons for why we have seen such a dramatic rise in prescription drug misuse. but one of the causes that we must examine more closely is prescribing practices and overprescribing. I recently joined my colleague. Congressman MOONEY of West Virginia. in introducing legislation that would address this problem. This amendment with Mr. GUINTA would help to shine more light on prescription drug misuse by requiring the task force to research addiction trends in communities with high rates of prescription drug misuse and overdoses. This research will be invaluable in the effort to identify why this crisis is hitting certain regions of our country particularly hard and in identifying further potential corrections to prescribing practices that can be made. I thank my colleagues for taking up such important legislation this week. and I urge support for this amendment. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire .
1140091745,Mr. Speaker. I thank my friend from Colorado for yielding. and I also thank the Representative from Georgia for his words. In New Hampshire. right now. we have a fourtimesgreater chance of dying from a heroin or opiate overdose than a car accident. as you have pointed out in national statistics. This morning. I rise to say that I am proud of what the House has been able to accomplish this week in a bipartisan way by working to address this critical challenge of substance use disorder that is devastating communities in my home State of New Hampshire and all across the country. Last year. I had the honor to cofound with my colleague from New Hampshire the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic to address the critical problems that heroin and opioid addiction are bringing to every corner of my district and most parts of the country. The membership of the task force now includes 83 members. about half Republicans and Democrats. who are dedicated to fighting this problem. Last month. we unveiled a legislative package of 15 bills to fight this epidemic. and we are pleased that many of these bills and provisions have been included in the package this week. To mark the start of opioid week. we held a Special Order on Tuesday evening. when over 20 Members from both sides of the aisle came to the floor to share personal stories of friends and family who had been affected by the heroin epidemic. As part of the Special Order. I told the story of Carl. the son of a constituent and friend of mine. Sue Messinger. Carl. at 24 years old. was working hard in college. He wanted to become a dentist. He was a recent graduate. He earned good grades. and he had his eye set on applying to dental school. But it turned out. unbeknownst to his family. Carl had been using heroin. His was another face of addiction. When he finally spoke to his parents. they began the long journey with him to recovery. They were able to secure a place in a detox program. and they then moved toward his recovery. He was passing every drug test. He remained resolutely committed to avoid drugs and alcohol. and his family was overjoyed to see him get better. But when Carl came down with an upper respiratory infection shortly thereafter. a fatal error occurred. Unaware of Carls history of addiction and his recent completion of detox. the doctor who he saw for the upper respiratory infection prescribed a narcotic cough suppressant. Triggered by the codeine in the cough syrup. Carls addiction to heroin was instantly reawakened. and he could not resist the craving. He injected heroin and died that day of pure fentanyl. 50 times more powerful than heroin. in his own home. There were no labels on the bottle that indicated that the cough medicine could trigger drugseeking behavior. There was no way for Carl or his mother or his parents to know that the cough medicine could pose a fatal danger. Since his death. his mother. Sue. has spoken out about the need to reform labeling requirements. And I am pleased to be a sponsor of Representative WALBERGS bipartisan bill seeking to ensure that medical professionals have full knowledge of a patients previous opioid addiction. Sadly. that bill is not in the package of bills this week. and it is one among many that we will need to address at a later date. So I am hopeful that I can continue to work with the chair of this committee and so many others on the other side of the aisle to bring forward bills such as this that will make a difference in peoples lives. Earlier this week. I introduced the Drug Abuse Crisis Act that will provide $600 million in critical funding to finally address this heroin epidemic. I want to close my remarks by talking about hope. So many of the bills that we have passed will finally bring hope for recovery. for treatment. for longterm recovery to the families. to the users. and to our communities. This legislation will build and expand upon the work that we have done this week by dramatically increasing resources for medicationassisted treatments. funding competitive programs for law enforcement and for those hardest hit by this drug crisis. I am opposing this rule before us today and the previous question so that we can move to consider my Drug Abuse Crisis Act. Lets bring hope to our families and communities. and please oppose the previous question.
1140102603,Mr. Speaker. I want to commend Judge POE for his eloquent words tonight. I appreciate the bipartisan sentiment. I rise tonight in solidarity with my courageous colleagues from across the country who spoke last week and. as Judge POE joined us. we read the eloquent words of the survivor in the Stanford University case. We rise tonight to show our continuing support for the woman known to the world as Emily Doe and to join with all of our sisters at Stanford and on college campuses and in communities around the Nation with one simple message to America: We are all Emily Doe. I am going to start my remarks tonight 40 years ago on a cold winter night at a prestigious college campusthis time on the East CoastI was an 18yearold student. I was going to a dance. The dance was at a fraternity. and I intended to enjoy the evening with my friends. We danced. We listened to music. We enjoyed the evening and we enjoyed the party until one young man assaulted me in a crude and insulting way. and I ran alone into the cold. dark night. I have never forgotten that night. I was filled with shame. regret. humiliation while he was egged on by everyone at that party standing by. Several years later. I was working as a legislative assistant right here on Capitol Hill. and I was assaulted again. this time by a distinguished guest of the United States Congress. I was 23 years old. And as Judge POE referenced tonight. I did not say a word to anyone. And. in fact. until I wrote these words to share with you tonight. I had never told anyone this story. My family didnt know. my husband. my children. my friends. I was 23. A few months after that evening. I was walking home from dinner at a diner right here on Capitol Hill. If I named it. you all would know it well. I was mugged. I was grabbed in the dark. and I fought free. And when I broke free. I ran. again. alone into the cold. dark night. I tell these stories tonight on the floor of the United States Congress not because they are remarkable or unique. Sadly. I tell these stories because they are all too common. You see. all of usMembers of Congress. college students. soldiers and sailors. mothers and sisterswe are all Emily Doe. And the message we hear and the message that the court sent in Stanford is that we are not safe. we are not secure. and we do not deserve to be free. free from sexual assault. free from rape. free from rude. crude. obnoxious offensive assaults on our bodies. on our beings. on ourselves. What we hear on college campuses. on military bases. in the workplace. and in the courthouse is that he has a future. he has potential. he was drunk. he didnt mean any harm. he just wanted to have fun. to get some action. and then get on with his life. What about her? What about her future? The student. the soldier. the sailor. the mother. the sister? We have been silent for too long. We also have potential. We also have a future. We are all Emily Doe. and tonight we will not be silent anymore. Tonight we stand togetherRepublicans and Democrats. mothers and sistersfrom across the country to take a stand for liberty and justice for all. We will fight for consequences for the 3 percent of men on college campuses and in our communities who are sexual predators and a menace to women everywhere. We will fight for bystander education and sexual assault prevention. For the 97 percent of men on college campuses and in our communities who can be part of the solution. join us in taking a stand against sexual assault. We will reward college campuses that are open. transparent. and not only change their policies and programs but actually hold the perpetrators accountable and provide real and effective counseling and support for those students who have been assaulted. And we will impose sanctions on college administrators who fail to act. fail to change. fail to prevent. fail to protect. Every student deserves to be safe. every student deserves to be secure. to live her life and to live her future. So remember. tonight we are all Emily Doe. She has given us our voice. and we will not be silent any longer. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts . my good friend and colleague.

1130008816,Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Chairman for yielding me time this afternoon. I am proudly standing here as an original cosponsor of this bill. H.R. 890. I think today gives us an opportunity. Mr. Speaker. to speak with clarity and say once and for all. regardless of the interpretations and regardless of the arguments on this floor. that we require an individual. before they benefit and they take. that they must work. I think it is a very safe thing for us to do. It mirrors the culture of this country down through the years. You know. I support these requirements because working is the best way to lift people out of poverty and give them the opportunity for earned success. I remember in my youth. my father. he clearly made us work. He made us understand the value of hard work. It wasnt a punishment. it wasnt cruel. He knew that through hard work that our character would be molded. and we would understand that through work and through the sweat of our brow that we would find the destiny for our own lives. I think today what this body should do. and will do. is clarify that the work requirements of TANF is a good thing. These work requirements are bipartisan. Weve all heard on the floor today the bipartisan effort between Republicans and Democrats alike during 1996. What were saying is they were good then. and they are good today. Most importantly. I am pleased with what occurred back in the midnineties. When youre talking about almost 73 percent of those who were on welfare moved to work. thats a positive thing for the lives of the American people. The administrations unprecedented actions are clearly circumventing this law and the will of the people. with over 83 percent of Americans today believing that these work requirements are a positive thing. Its common sense. its a selfevident truth: if you want a positive future. you must help create that. and part of that requirement is that you must work. I urge my colleagues today to join me in supporting H.R. 890 because it returns us to the real work of helping people who need it most.
1130032131,amendment reflects what many of us believe is a successful formula to apply to a program that has. in the eyes of the GAO. in the eyes of the independent auditors who look at these programs. a program that is in dire need of improvement because of the error rates and the waste and the other things that are occurring in this program. In addition to that. it reflects our strong belief that ablebodied people should have the opportunity and should go in and be a productive citizen. Thats what this amendment says. It gives States an option. It was a pilot project because it reflects a winning formula from the welfare reform program back in 1996 that was put into place. with unequivocal successablebodied people going back to work. working families beginning to have productive income. not just taking a check from the government. There was never an intention at all for our side to say we want to take away the safety net of the food stamp program. absolutely not. This was a pilot project. that was it. It was up to the States whether they wanted to participate to see if they could get more people back to work. Again. consistent with what the GAO reports have said over and over again. these programs are in need of reform. Again. it was not as if this amendment came out of thin air. The gentleman. the ranking member. the entire leadership on the minority side knew this amendment was there. And the gentleman forever is on this floor. Mr. Speaker. talking about regular order. talking about the need for us to have open process. perhaps to let the will of the House be worked and then go to conference. That was what the goal here was. let the will of the House allowed to be seen through. work its will. and then go to conference. And then we would try and participate in a robust discussion with the other side of the Capitol to see if we could see clear on some reform measures to a bill and a program that is in desperate need of that. Mr. Speaker. again. what we saw today was a Democratic leadership in the House that was insistent to undo years and years of bipartisan work on an issue like a farm bill and decide to make it a partisan issue. Mr. Speaker. it is unfortunate that that is the case. I do agree with the gentleman. But I hope that we can see our way to working on other issues where there is potential agreement. Yes. we have fundamental disagreements on many things. but were all human beings. representing the 740some thousand people that put us here and expect us to begin to learn to set aside those disagreements and find ways we can work together. Today was an example. The other side. Mr. Speaker. did not think that was their goal. did not think that was an appropriate mission. and instead decided to emphasize where they perhaps differed when we wanted to reform in a certain area.
1130057249,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding to me today. Today I rise in support of this rule for the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. and I agree with my colleague on the other side of the aisle. the gentlewoman from California . She understands how important this bill is. as do I. Make no mistake. this is a jobs bill. We are going to be able to take advantage of economic opportunities because of this piece of legislation. I am proud to serve as a member of the Transportation Committee. That this bill passed unanimously out of committee is something that I think needs to be noted. This legislation enhances the Army Corps of Engineers ability to develop and support Americas port and waterway infrastructure. and it does so with full spending offsets and zero earmarks. That is the kind of commonsense reform I believe the American people expect and deserve. This bill places hard caps on the time and cost of studies. eliminates duplications and delays. places a 3year cap on those studies and caps in dollar amounts of $3 million. It expands the role of publicprivate partnerships in water infrastructure and makes significant changes to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund so that monies that are collected for harbor maintenance are more fully utilized for their design purpose. I know it is a novel idea that those monies collected for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund would be there. and this bill addresses that. Perhaps most importantly to the people of my district. this bill begins a critically important conversation that began at the committee level on the impact of the decreased water flows down the ACF River system and into the Apalachicola Bay. The Apalachicola Bay is a natural treasure. producing 90 percent of Floridas oyster harvest and 10 percent of the Nations oyster harvest. The oystermen. small businesses. and hardworking families who depend on this bay have seen their livelihoods put at risk. I am pleased that Chairman SHUSTER and the ranking member have worked in good faith to begin this dialogue with me. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to support this rule. as well as the underlying bill. which provides critical support to Floridas 15 deepwater ports and allows us to be fully prepared for the economic opportunities as a result of the Panama Canal expansion.
1130114949,Mr. Chair. I appreciate the efforts of you and Ranking Member RAHALL. and those efforts. how they have advanced this bipartisan piece of legislation. I would also like to thank Subcommittee Chairman GIrnS for giving this issue the urgent attention that it deserves. For more than 40 years. Americas waters have been made cleaner and safer by a balanced regulatory partnership between the States and the Federal Government. The basis for this partnership was a commonsense understanding that not all waters are subject to Federal jurisdiction and that the States must have the primary responsibility for regulating waters within their own boundaries. But. now. decades of success have been put at risk under the guise of clarifying the scope of the Federal jurisdiction. Under its proposed rules. Federal agencies like the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers would see their regulatory authority under the Clean Water Act drastically expanded. to the point of covering almost any body of water throughout America. from ditches to culverts to pipes to watersheds to farmland ponds. This would have devastating consequences on virtually every major section of our economy. including farming. construction. manufacturing. transportation. and energy development. That is why I have introduced H.R. 5078. the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014. Our bipartisan bill draws a line in the sand that preserves the critical FederalState partnership in place today. By preventing the EPA and the Corps of Engineers from finalizing or implementing the proposed rule. we are providing a safeguard against the Federal Governments overreach into regulatory decisions best made by officials at the State and local levels. We are also requiring the EPA and the Corps to consult with the State and local officials to form a consensus proposal on the scope of the future water regulations under the Clean Water Act. This bill is not antienvironment. It is not anticlean water. Our bill preserves the partnership we have had in place for years to strengthen the health of our waterways and manage our water quality. and it does so in a way that maintains certainty for our job creators. E11400 For these reasons. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.

1130060999,Mr. Speaker. this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. My motion is similar to an amendment offered by my good friend. Ranking Member CONYERS. during the committee markup. It simply excludes civil rights cases from this act. My amendment makes it crystal clear that discrimination based on sex. race. age. or other forms of discrimination will not be subjected to lengthy. expensive sanctions. People should have a right to seek redress to petition the courts to act. For an individual to be able to take legal action based on discrimination because of age. race. color. gender. or sexual orientation is not senseless. It is not frivolous or silly. They are exercising their sacred right to work to make our union stronger and better for generations to come. Mr. Speaker. I am not sure that my friends and colleagues in this body fully understand the importance of my amendment. Civil rights lawsuits are unique because they push the judiciary to review. question. consider. and update our Nations commitmentour constitutional dutyto respect the dignity and the worth of every human being. These cases inspire our judicial system to explore and develop new legal theories and standards. There is no doubt that legislation like H.R. 2655 would have slowed down many historic legal successes of the 20th century. Civil rights landmarks like BROWN v. BOARD OF EDUCATION would have taken another 10 years. Rights to marital privacy could have been debated for who knows how long. Blacks and Whites would not have been free to marry. Samesex couples would not have been able to love each other. Decisions guaranteeing freedom of the press and First Amendment protections could be ongoing. Civil rights legal progress would have been even slower if this act was the law of the land 60. 50. or even 20 years ago. Our judicial system of thoughtful. deliberative. constant review makes our historyour progress. our commitment to justicea model for nations around the world. This effort has been tried already. It does not work. My amendment corrects the greatest injustice of this bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support my commonsense change to this seriously flawed legislation. This amendment is the right thing to do. the fair thing to do. It is the just thing to do. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130097346,Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio . the esteemed chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. for her hard work. for her leadership on this resolution. and for her kind words. I would also like to thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her kind words and for her leadership. The two of them have never given up or given in and have kept the faith. and for that. I thank them so much. I would also like to thank the Speaker and our friends on both sides of the aisle for helping to bring this resolution to the floor. I am glad to be on the floor with the gentleman from South Carolina. JIM CLYBURN. who I met more than 50 years ago at an organizer meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. when we both were very young. first for the sitins. when we both had all of our hair. To be here with the gentleman from South Carolina today. if someone had told me then that the two of us would be sitting here in the Congress. I would say: you are crazy. you are out of your mind. you dont know what you are talking about. Fifty years ago. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law. This bipartisan effort outlawed discrimination based on race. color. religion. sex. or national origin. The following year. President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law. It was a bipartisan effort. Mr. Speaker. if you visit my office in the Cannon Building. you will see both Democrats and Republicans standing together. You will see me standing with Members of the Senate. One man I will never forget. the Republican leader Everett Dirksen. helped make it possible to get the bill passed. Too many people I knew and loved lost their lives in the fight for civil rights and simple justice. Every single day. each and every one of us must remember the heroesaverage men. women. and childrenwho put their lives on the line in the fight for equality. We cannot forget their sacrifice. and we must not ignore the lessons of history. When we come together across party lines. from different races. religions. and regions. we can achieve the greater good. I hope and pray that we will come together againDemocrats and Republicans. of all faiths. colors. and regionsto pass laws that maintain. protect. and strengthen rights for which many gave their ultimate sacrifice. Again. Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan. the gentlewoman from Ohio. and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their strong support of this resolution.
1130120162,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank my friend and my colleague. Congressman JEFFRIES. for organizing this Special Order. Thank you for all that you do. Thank you for speaking up and speaking out. Thank you for finding a way to get in the way. Mr. Speaker. our march toward a more perfect Union has been long. hard. and tedious. but we must continue to move forward. I know there are forces that want to stop us. slow us down. and take us back. but as a Nation and as a people. we have made too much progress to turn back now. Through hard work. discipline. and with the blessing of the Almighty. we canand we willmove to redeem the soul of America and create a more perfect Union. The American people are ready. They have grown by leaps and bounds to build bridges of understanding between diverse communities. As their Representatives. will we follow their lead? Can we work together in this body as one people. one family. who live in the same house. one housethe American house? We dont have to be mean to each other. We dont have to put each other down. My work in the movement taught memy faith has taught me and many othersto respect the dignity and the worth of every human being. There is some good in the worst of us because everything that is was made by our Creator. That is why we must respect the worth and dignity and that spark of the divine in each one of us. As A. Philip Randolpha dean of Black leadership. the visionary who planned the historic March on Washington in 1963 and the founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Portersonce said: ""We may have all come here on different ships. but were all in the same boat now."" My colleagues. my brothers and sisters. we must keep the faith. We must press toward the mark of the public good and put our personal ambitions aside. As Mr. JEFFRIES did a few moments ago. let me paraphrase the words of a great Republican President who lived in a more divisive time even than in our own. He said: Brave men. both living and dead. have consecrated the American soil with their tears. their sweat. and their blood. The world will little note nor long remember what we said here. but it will never forget what we did here. We must be dedicated . . . to the great tasks remaining before us . . . and make sure they did not sacrifice in vain. that this Nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that the government of the people. by the people. and for the people shall not perish from the Earth. Thank you. Mr. JEFFRIES."

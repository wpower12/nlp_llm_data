1140030076,"Mr. Chair. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2578. The Internet is one of the great American success stories in our history. benefitting billions of people around the world. Congress has a longstanding and bipartisan commitment to a global. open Internet. free from governmental control. Our support for the decentralized. multistakeholder approach to Internet governance has enabled its growth as an unparalleled platform for economic opportunity and democratic participation. Last year the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced that the U.S. government would take an important step to transition technical functions of the domain name system to the multistakeholder community. This transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to the private sector has been a U.S. policy goal for two decades. through Republican and Democratic administrations alike. Since NTIAs announcement. the multistakeholder community has stepped up to the plate to craft a transition proposal and enhanced accountability measures needed in the absence of U.S. government stewardship. NTIA has articulated specific criteria for the transition proposal and made clear that any plan must advance our vision of a free and open Internet. Despite this significant progress. H.R. 2578 includes language that blocks NTIA from using funds to relinquish the IANA functions. This limitation of funds is not only unnecessary. it sends the wrong message to the international community. Our diplomats point to the IANA transition announcement as a key factor helping us win allies and support for an Internet free of government control. As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stated. this funding restriction ""could result in harm to U.S. businesses and Internet users as a whole."" While I oppose this provision in H.R. 2578. I agree with my colleagues that the IANA transition must be conducted carefully and transparently. Thats why Im working with my Republican colleagues at the Energy and Commerce Committee on legislation to ensure NTIA implements the IANA transition consistent with the principles we all support. Our legislation will address concerns about transparency and accountability. while reaffirming our commitment to the transition. While I cannot support the funding restriction in H.R. 2578. I stand ready to work with my colleagues on responsible oversight of the IANA transition. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule. the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5minute rule. During consideration of the bill for amendment each amendment shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent and shall not be subject to amendment. No pro forma amendment shall be in order except that the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees may offer up to 10 pro forma amendments each at any point for the purpose of debate. The Chair of the Committee of the Whole may accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD designated for that purpose. Amendments so printed shall be considered read. The Clerk will read."
1140032828,I thank the gentlewoman from Texas. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 235. the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act. Now. whether it is communication. commerce. business. education. research. access to the Internet is today an integral part of the everyday life of millions of Americans and people around the world. And we take great pride in this because this is an American invention. Just this month. the GAO released a new report which found that broadband affordability continues to be the most frequently identified barrier to adoption. Now. this whole issue of taxation for access to the Internet. this is not the collection of taxes across State lines. That is another issue. There are over 10.000 taxing agencies in the United States today. Imagine if we. you. your constituents. everyone in the country who uses the Internet has to pay for access to the Internet every time they go to use it. that they would be taxed on that. So. the temporary. or the moratorium bill that we have. now this one makes it permanent. This is a bipartisan effort. Over 200 cosponsors in the Congress are on it. We want to encourage expanded broadband adoption. If you tax it. you are going to shrink it. And I think in the communities that are of lower economic means. this is going to hurt them even more. We need to do everything we can to ensure that Internet access is universally affordable. This bill is an important component of that effort by permanently eliminating the taxation of Internet access. The current moratorium. as my colleagues have said. expires October 1. and we want to be ahead of that to keep the door open. but no taxation to access. I want to salute the chairman. Chairman GOODLATTE. We are good friends. We have worked on other efforts. As I said. this bill has nearly 200 bipartisan cosponsors and strong support of the communications. Internet. and ecommerce industries. So I would urge all of my colleagues to support this. and understand that. from the ground up. we want to expand the use of broadband in our country for every community. Whether they are poor. whether they are rural. whether they are in a city. whether they are middle class individuals. we dont want to weigh the Internet down with taxation of average people in this country. It would really be unfair. and I think it would smother the Internet as we know it.
1140043205,"Mr. Chair. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2898 because it upends decades of state and federal water law and needlessly pits water users against one another. In the midst of Californias worst drought in its history. this bill mandates that certain interests come out ahead of others. California is currently in the fourth year of a punishing drought that has forced every resident to conserve water. has caused millions of acres of agricultural land to be fallowed. and places us at risk of major wildfires. But. this crisis should not be used as an excuse to permanently upend a century of water law and countless protections for threatened and endangered wildlife. H.R. 2898 will weaken or override decades of state and federal law. including California state water law and the California Constitution. the state and federal Endangered Species Acts. the National Environmental Policy Act. and the San Joaquin River Settlement Act. This list should set off alarm bells for any proponent of states rights or cooperative federalism. For over a century. the federal government has deferred to state water law whenever possible. but this bill unwinds that history entirely. And what do we gain by discarding a century of water law and species protections? According to the Department of Interior which manages the Delta collaboratively with the state. this bill ""will not provide additional meaningful relief to those most affected by the drought."" Local conservationists predict that this bill would cause a complete extinction of the Delta smelt and would accelerate the decline of the wild salmon and steelhead runs in California which have been an important part of the Northern California economy since the mid19th century. Instead of taking up partisan legislation that will start a new water war in California. Congress should be providing immediate relief to droughtimpacted communities and should invest in longterm drought resilience measures such as conservation. recycling. and desalination. which would drastically increase the amount of water available to farmers in the Central Valley. This irresponsible bill would override sciencebased management of the delicate Delta infrastructure and would gut several of our most bedrock environmental laws. For these reasons I strongly oppose this legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote against it."
1140055772,Mr. Chairman. I thank our ranking member. Mr. Chairman. I oppose this legislation for several reasons. First. except in very narrow circumstances. the bill does not allow any limitsnot any limitson exports of domestic oil regardless of potential threats to our national security. and that is our top responsibility as Membersour national security. For decades there has been a bipartisan commitment in Congress and several administrations to energy independence and reducing our reliance on foreign oil. Given the continued dependence of our economy and our military on oil. energy independence remains critical to our national defense. But with little consideration of any national security implications. this bill allows unlimited exports of a critical strategic resource. Mr. Chairman. the United States still imports 26 percent of the oil we consume and remains the worlds top importer. Every barrel exported under this bill would have to be replaced by a barrel imported from elsewhere. leaving us more reliant on foreign countries. The bill allows the President to limit exports only if he declares an emergency under the National Emergencies Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or if he is directed by the International Energy Agency to respond to an international supply crisis. Outside of these narrow circumstances. the bill permits no restrictions on exports of crude oil. This means strategic considerations such as decreasing our reliance on imports from unfriendly regimes can play no part in deciding whether to allow exports. I dont think that is a good deal at all. The bill also will have drastic impacts on the U.S. shipbuilding industry. tanker fleet. and refineries. all of which are critical to our national defense. Congress has recognized for nearly 100 years that it benefits our national security to maintain a robust domestic shipbuilding industry and commercial shipping fleet. For example. crude exports from Alaska which were legalized in 1995 must be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels crewed by Americans. This bill contains no requirement that exports be carried on U.S.-flagged tankers. Under current law. the President can allow exports of crude oil if he finds they are in the national interest. This bill would allow unlimited exports regardless of whether they are in the national security interests of the United States or not. I think that this is a slippery slope. Commander Kirk Lippold. the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole. testified before Congress earlier this year.
1140056884,"I thank the gentlewoman from California. the chair of the California Democratic delegation. and my dear friend and colleague. Mr. Speaker. it is really. I think. bittersweet this evening because we loved Congressman Don Edwards so much. and it is hard to imagine the world without him. He was the kind of human being that you wanted to have live forever. Instead. his contributions to our Nation. to the State of California. to his community are a record that will be revered for generations and generations and generations to come. There is a lot that has already been said about Don. beautiful things that have been said about Don. how he graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School. how he began his professional career as an FBI agent. and how he joined the Navy as an intelligence officer. So he served our country in many different roles. and. of course. the crown of his public service career was right here in the House of the people. the House of Representatives. He was a smallbusiness man in a business that his father owned and that he became a part of during the 1950s. and then. of course. he was elected as a Democrat. In fact. I still have in my office an invitation that Don had sent out. I think it must have been for some fundraiser that he had had. but the cover of that invitation has Don Edwards standing next to a very young President of the United States. John F. Kennedy. Young children and those who helped elect John F. Kennedy and anyone else who comes through my office very often remark about the picture. It is something that I cherish. that my staff cherishes. and my constituents do. It has been said that he was elected to be the president of the California Young Republicans. That is a very prestigious organization. and I can just see Don. elegant in every way. He dressed magnificently. He had the most beautiful posture. The way he carried himself. he almost kind of glided down the hall. But he had a deep sense of humility about him. We talk about his greatness and his goodness. and he was never one to want to be served. His joy was in serving. And so he had more than a healthy dose of humility about him. Don Edwards had an eloquence about him that ran as deep as his beliefs. In my lifetime. he had two great love affairs. One was Edie. and the other was the Constitution. He loved the flag. He understood that that was a symbol of our country. but he knew that the Constitution. our Constitution. was the soul of our Nation. and that is where he embedded himselfin the Constitution and in the subcommittee that did its work to always reinforce and establish the constitutionality and make the Constitution live for people who it had not touched yet. If there is anything that would be noble. I think that that is. and the record that he built was one where he was the foremost champion of civil rights. having drafted every civil rights bill in the House of Representatives for two decades. What a record. What a magnificent record. He loved his community. I remember when he announced that he was retiring. He thanked his constituents for the patience that they had extended to him because. I think. many times in the debate about what is constitutional and how to extend rights to people. it is not always very popular in the beginning. We love our history once it has been made. but we struggle very hard and dont always recognize the opportunity at hand in that history is being made. In his gentle. elegant way. he thanked his constituents for the patience that they had had with him in that they had stayed with him so that he could do the work that he did on their behalf. He famously said. in the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights Act: ""If you cant vote. you are not a real citizen."" So he understood where the nub of the dignity of citizenship rested: voting. I dont think he could really comprehend why the Voting Rights Act is not being brought up today so that we can all vote on it and improve what is so essential in the life of the citizens of our country. I think. Mr. Speaker. that Congressman Edwards would be very proud of his colleagues in the California Democratic delegation today. starting with our chair. ZOE LOFGREN. who not only worked side by side with him. but now chairs our delegation. The values that he carried. the values that he loved and that he made so real and shared with everyone in the House. whether colleagues agreed or disagreed with him. they drew a great sense of joy from him because they knew the love of our Constitution and of our country that he carried. and so they respected him. What he carried and did here. I think he would be very proud of his fellow Californians for carrying those traditions on. I want to pay tribute especially to Shary Farr. Congressman SAM FARRs wife. As I said to Shary. because she was there when Don took his last breath. I feel that we were all there with him because she was. She did so much in seeing to the great care that was given to him until he took his last breath. There is a poet that wrote: And so he passed on. and all the trumpets sounded on the other side. God bless you. Don Edwards. for what you gave and created for our country. We bless your name. and we thank you for your service. It is an honor to honor you. We love the Edwards family. and we always will."
1140065290,"Mr. Speaker. let me begin by saying Im pleased that this bill includes several measures I have championed. including bills Ive offered relating to energy efficiency and electric vehicles. However. I have to oppose this legislation because H.R. 8 fails to address climate change. In fact. the bill includes several controversial provisions that shift our nations energy policy into reverse. Im very grateful to Chairman UPTON and Subcommittee Chairman WHITFIELD for including my legislation. the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act. in the base text of H.R. 8. This bipartisan. noncontroversial bill which I introduced with Rep. KINZINGER. received 375 votes on the House floor last year. This measure would save taxpayers millions of dollars and would make the federal government a leader in reducing energy use at data centers which can be highly inefficient. I also appreciate that two amendments I offered at the Energy and Commerce Committee markup of this bill were agreed to by voice vote and are included in the Managers Amendment. The first would allow federal agencies to offer electric vehicle charging stations to guests and employees. a practice that is not currently allowed. The second would add transparency requirements to ensure that only critical infrastructure information is protected from FOIA requests. and that this designation is periodically reviewed to ensure this authority is not abused. These provisions are incremental but important steps toward promoting innovation and deployment of clean and energysaving technologies. Unfortunately. the same cannot be said about the rest of H.R. 8. With historic international climate negotiations currently underway in Paris. this socalled ""comprehensive"" energy bill does not include a single reference to climate change or promotion of renewable resources. This represents the squandering of an opportunity to put in place a 21st century energy policy for our country that promotes clean energy and reduces our dependence on the fossil fuel resources that cause climate change. H.R. 8 includes several controversial provisions that my colleagues and I opposed at Committee and that are also opposed by the Administration. For example. the bill contains unnecessary provisions to shortcircuit the review process for exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The current process. which requires the Department of Energy to ensure that all exports are in the public interest of the United States. is working and already has us on track to be the largest LNG exporter in the world within a decade. H.R. 8 also includes provisions that would require a shortsighted view of energy efficiency investments in building codes. and it would repeal the requirement that all new and remodeled federal buildings phase out fossil fuel use by 2030. Lastly. the Managers Amendment includes a highly controversial bill from the Natural Resources Committee that would limit public review and direct more natural gas pipelines to be built on public lands. including National Parks. Again. I appreciate the Chairmans willingness to accept my bipartisan additions to this bill. but I cannot support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to oppose it."
1140081362,"Mr. Speaker. Im pleased to rise today in support of my legislation. the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act. I thank Chairman UPTON. Ranking Member PALLONE. and my legislative partner Congressman ADAM KINZINGER for their strong support of this bill. This bill is all about bringing our federal governments IT and data centers into the 21st century. The federal government is the nations largest landowner. employer. and energy user and should lead by example in this field. By requiring federal agencies to utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies. this legislation will reduce the federal governments energy use. save taxpayer dollars. and set the standard for the private sector. Today. the world generates more data in twelve hours than was generated in all of human history prior to 2003. This data must be stored and processed at data centers which are the backbone of the 21st century economy but can be highly energy inefficient. While we now routinely hear about data centers. this was not the case when I began examining this issue over a decade ago. In those days I had to explain to my colleagues what a data center was. Today. most people understand that data centers are a critical part of our national infrastructure and are found in nearly every sector of our economy. According to the GSA. the federal government alone has more than 2.000 data centers which store everything from Social Security and tax records to ebooks at the Library of Congress. Data centers are critical to our economy and our lives. but they can be extremely inefficient when it comes to energy use. Experts estimate that most data centers could slash their energy use by up to 80 or 90 percent by simply implementing existing technologies and best practices. Several Silicon Valley companies have taken the lead in developing efficient. sustainable data centers. but we can do much more across both the private sector and government. H.R. 1268 will drive energy efficiency improvements across the governments IT and data centers by requiring federal agencies to: 1. Utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies. 2. Formulate specific goals and periodically evaluate their energy efficiency. and 3. Make data center energy usage statistics public in a way that empowers further innovation. Importantly. the bill requires government agencies to formulate specific performance goals and a means to calculate overall cost savings. The Department of Energy estimates that implementation of best practices alone could reduce the governments data center energy bill by 20 to 40 percent. And the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions found that widespread adoption of energy efficient information technologies could save the federal government over $5 billion in energy costs through 2020. In 2005. I authored language in the Energy Policy Act which mandated an EPA study on the energy use and energy costs of data centers. This report was transmitted to Congress in 2007 and served as a driver of both private and public investment in energy efficiency. Based on widespread agreement across government. industry and academia. the bill before us today requires an update to this important report. H.R. 1268 also creates a new ""Open Data"" initiative to make federal data center energy usage statistics publicly available in a way that empowers further innovation. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act passed the House last Congress with 375 votes. It passed the House again in this Congress as part of H.R. 8. and it is included in the Senates comprehensive energy bill which is currently being debated. This noncontroversial. bipartisan bill has strong support from both industry and energy efficiency advocates. and I urge my colleagues to support it."
1140081531,"Mr. Speaker. I thank my friend. the gentleman from Nebraska. the very distinguished Mr. FORTENBERRY. I thank him for his words and for his magnificent remarks here on the floor this evening. We obviously share the same sentiments. I think if anyone is tuned in this evening for what we call a Special Order. the Congress is not really held in great regard today. but there is on a daytoday basis for so many of us a discovery of deep friendship that is created. that comes about because we work so closely together on something that binds us. where we have not only common ground. but the deep. deep values of our country that are embedded in us and everyone here. people across the country. and that we get to work on it together. Congressman FORTENBERRY is my brother. and I thank him. I thank him from the bottom of my heart for the values that he has expressed. the work that he has put into this. and what it means to the people that we are speaking for. This resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that the atrocities that are being perpetrated by ISIS. they constitute war crimes. and they are genocide against religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria and throughout the region. Now. over the past decade we have really witnessed an acceleration. It started when there was the invasion of Iraq. but it has heightened as the years have gone on. And now the assault on Christians and other religious minorities. particularly by ISIS. has moved to a level of barbarism that we read about in the history books. and is taking place. imagine. in the 21st century. It has included the torture and the murder of thousands. the displacement of millions. including Assyrians. Chaldeans. Syriacs. Armenians. Turkmen. SabeaMandeans. Kakae. Amalekites. and the Yazidis that Mr. FORTENBERRY has spoken to and represents so magnificently. These are families that are being torn apart. fathers and sons being executed. mothers and daughters being enslaved and raped. The USA Today columnist. Kirsten Powers. painted a very vivid picture when she wrote in December of last year: In October. Islamic State militants in Syria demanded that two Christian women and six men convert to Islam. When they refused. the women were publicly raped. and then beheaded along with the men. On the same day. militants cut off the fingertips of a 12year old boy in an attempt to force his Christian father to convert. When his father refused. they were brutalized and they were both crucified. Today. there are fewer than 500 Christians remaining in Iraq. down from as many as 1.5 million in 2003. Now. the United Nations has written. come up with a definition some time ago of what genocide actually is: Any of the following acts committed with an intent to destroy. in whole or in part. a national. ethnical. racial or religious group. as such: killing members of the group. causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction. in whole or in part. imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group. and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is genocide. and this is what is actually taking place today. Despite the persecution of these hundreds of thousands of religious minorities. the United States has not spoken out. but tonight the United States House of Representatives has. And this is a seminal moment for the House to have taken this on and to express unanimously that this is genocide. There are many things that we have worked on together. as members of. and other members as well. of the House Religious Minority Caucus. humanitarian aid. protection. faster refugee processing for these vulnerable communities. and an official statement by the Congress. Tonight that happened. We have labeled these atrocities for what they are. genocide. I think that Congressman FORTENBERRY has stated in a most eloquent way why this is important. First of all. this is one of the great values of our country. one of the great. great values of our country. where we recognize religions of people of all religious backgrounds. Our Constitution. in just a few words. in just a few words. I believe. has prevented bloodshed. whereas in other places. it takes place. It is as deeply meaningful to me as a firstgeneration American. the only Member of the entire Congress that is of Assyrian and Armenian descent. This is a repeat of history of my family. It is why I am a firstgeneration American. because my grandparents fled. both sides of my family. the Armenian side and the Assyrian side. for this very reason. because they were being hunted down and persecuted because they were Christians. We know that a century ago the world witnessedbut the House and the Congress is still silent on this. and we have to address that. toowhen the Ottoman Empire rounded up and murdered Armenians. Greeks. and other minorities in Constantinople. By 1923. there were some 1.5 million women. children. and men who were lost. It was a systematic campaign that we now know as and call the Armenian Genocide. So for those in my family who told the stories. my grandparents. my parents. this is. for me. a bittersweet evening. But I think that they are all proud. those who have been called to God. and those who are still with us. that the United States House of Representatives is calling this out for what it is. It matters when the United States speaks. Our voices collectively. this evening. are going to echo around the world. and the stability. as Congressman FORTENBERRY spoke to. of these minority communities. have really been the glue that have held these ancient communities together for so long. I. too. share the hope and pray for the day that there will be peace in the region and that they will be recognized and honored in their communities. on the lands. these ancient lands. with their ancient faiths. I think that is the collective hope of all of us. The stability and. I think. the cultural identity of the Middle East depends on this. The United States has always championed human rights. basic human rights. and civil and religious liberties. both at home and abroad. Whenever we go abroad. those are the issues that we raise with whomever we are meeting with. I think that these are our most cherished values and. I think. Americas greatest export. During his trip to South America in July of 2015. Pope Francis called for an end to this genocide of Christians in the Middle East. saying. ""In this third world war which we are now experiencing. a form of genocide is taking place. and it must end."" I think his voice spoke. obviously. for the voiceless. Bishop Demetrios of Mokissos. the Chancellor of the Greek Orthodox Church of Chicago. recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal the following: ""It may seem like we in the United States have little ability to change conditions in the Middle East and elsewhere. But that outlook has too often led to inaction and great regret after crimes against humanity have been allowed to unfold without intervention. The United States and other members of the U.N. made a solemn vow in 2005 with the passage of the Responsibility to Protect. a response to crimes against humanity. With genocide occurring before our very eyes. we must properly identify the crimes and honor our international commitment under the Responsibility to Protect."" So. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues. with the words of Pope Francis. Bishop Demetrios. countless advocates across our country and around the world. and the 203 bipartisan cosponsors of this resolution. and the voice of the entire House. unanimous vote this evening of this resolution. I am very proud. I am very proud and I am lastingly grateful to be a part of this body that has spoken as one on this issue of enormous import and morality because we. tonight. have let it be known to the world that this is. in fact. the horror of genocide that is taking place in the Middle East. Again. it is a moment of great pride to me. certainly to my family and to people. not only my own people. but to those across the United States. the religious leaders of all faiths that have spoken out. This tonight. the evening of March 14. 2016. will live on and historians will record that we indeed did the right thing. So I thank you all. Historians will record that we indeed did the right thing. So I thank you all."
1140085851,Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2666. and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. today we are debating a bill that the majority has titled the No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act. It sounds terrific. On the surface. this bill appears to do what Democrats and Republicans both support. We both support this. What we support is very clear: preventing the FCC from setting the monthly rate that customers pay for Internet access service. But in reality. this bill is about undermining the FCCs authority to protect consumers and ensure a free and open Internet for all. I listened very carefully to the chairman. whom I respect. who is my friend. talking about innovation. talking about the effect that that has on so much that we do. I represent the innovation capital of our country and the world. Silicon Valley. so I think that I understand something about innovation and the ingredients that make it work. As the ranking member of the subcommittee. I have made it very clear that I do not support setting rates for customers to pay on Internet access. nor do any of my Democratic colleagues on the committee. In factand the chairman left this out. The chairman left this out. In fact. during the subcommittee and full committee markup of this bill. I offered an airtight. onepage amendment. right hereright here. onepage amendmentto codify that the FCC will permanently forbear from setting the rates that customers pay for Internet access. It is airtight. It is as clear as a bell. but it was rejected twice. Now. why would the majority reject exactly what they say they are seeking? It is a good question. It is a rhetorical question. but it should be raised. I think it is because this bill is about more than the FCC setting the rates that customers pay for Internet access. The FCC is the cop on the beat in the communications marketplace. That means the FCC has the responsibility to keep watch over the companies that provide our cell phone. cable. and Internet services to ensure that everyone is treated fairly. I think. in the absence of the following. not one consumer organization in the country supports the bill that is on the floor because it is overly broad. The definition of rate regulation in this bill leaves the door open for courts to strike down the FCCs authority to protect consumers and act in the public interest if they interpret any of its actions as impacting broadband Internet rates. That is what this bill does. That is what we object to. We do not object to. essentially. what the title of the bill is. No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access. These protections include prohibiting Internet service providers. ISPs. from capping the amount of data that customers can use. outlawing payforprivacy agreements where consumers have to pay fees to avoid having their data collected and sold to third parties. enforcing net neutrality rules against blocking Web sites. and reviewing mergers that increase consolidation and limit choice in the broadband Internet market. As I said a moment ago. it is no wonder this bill is opposed by over 70 public interest groups. including the National Hispanic Media Coalition. the Consumer Federation of America. and the National Consumer Law Center. And the White House has said that it will veto the bill. We could have come here with a very simple bill that essentially is what my amendment stated: no rate regulation. That is what the majority says that they are for. except the bill goes way beyond that. I want to make it clear to my colleagues and to the American people that may be tuned in to this debate: This bill. in its broadness. is an attack on consumers and an attack on the FCCs net neutrality rules. Now. that is not a surprise because the majority has never supported that. And that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. Mr. Chairman. I include in the RECORD three letters from consumer organizations. I reserve the balance of my time. Hon. PAUL RYAN. Speaker. House of Representatives. Hon. NANCY PELOSI. Democratic Leader. House of Representatives.

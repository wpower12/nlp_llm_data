1140016083,Mr. Chairman. today. I rise in opposition to this substitute amendment. Every day. I hear from my constituents in Tennessee who are still struggling to find work and make ends meet. This is the result of the slowest economic recovery in American history. and. in parts of my district. communities are still plagued by doubledigit unemployment rates. yet this amendment would raise taxes on Americans by $3.2 trillion. This would be on top of the $1.6 trillion in new taxes already imposed under President Obama. Raising taxes on small business is exactly the opposite of what is needed to reduce unemployment. get Americans back to work. and grow our economy. Even with this $3.2 trillion tax increase. which would be the largest in American history. this budget would never balance. In fact. compared to A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America. this substitute amendment would add $4 trillion to our debt over the next 10 years. This is because this amendment would increase spending by $7 trillion. compared to the House Republican budget. In fact. it increases spending for every category in the budget except for our national defense. This budget would take $1 trillion of its proposed tax hikes and use all of this money to break the Budget Control Act spending caps for nondefense spending only. This is unacceptable. At a time when we are faced with Russian aggression in the Ukraine. the threat of ISIS in the Middle East. and an increasingly unpredictable security environment. we need to adequately fund our servicemen and -women. That is why the House Republican budget would comply with the current spending caps in the law but still adds $387 billion in defense spending over a 10year window. all while balancing the budget without any tax increases. Long before I served on the Budget Committee. I got a crash course on budgeting 101 as a single working mother. And in those years. I raised three children on a nurses salary. teaching me how to live within my means and stretch my dollars. Mr. Chair. I have had to work to make ends meet. so I know how important our social safety net is for those in need. I want to see this safety net strengthened and preserved for future generations. However. this budget falls into the trap of measuring how much we care by how much we spend. Federal programs and initiatives should be evaluated based on their outcomes. by how many people we help get out of poverty. help to get back to work. and help to get the training and the education they need. One example is our Federal job training program. In 2011. the Government Accountability Office. the GAO. issued a report that found 47 overlapping Federal job training programs. costing $18 billion in 2009 alone. The report showed that this duplication was not serving workers that needed training and was not responsibly using Federal dollars. If we want to help workers who need training. there is a clear need to reform these programs to improve outcomes. That is why last year. this House passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. By the way. it was bipartisan legislation which was signed into law and made important reforms to Federal job training programs. better helping workers looking for a job while responsibly using taxpayer dollars. This substitute budget would take a step back from these reforms and simply spend an additional $13 billion on these programs without any reform. Unfortunately. this is just one example of this substitute amendment doubling down on failed policies of the past. Additionally. it would create a $1 billion slush fund for a national stimulus program. Just like the previously failed stimulus program. this would do nothing to create new jobs and simply adds another $100 billion to our debt. which our children and our grandchildren will have to pay. It would also reverse bipartisan reforms made to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. commonly called SNAP. and increase spending. If we want to protect those who are most in need. we need to find ways to reform the SNAP program. The substitute amendment would go further than even ObamaCare has. calling for the creation of a public health insurance option. a backdoor way to nationalizing our health care system. This idea is so radical that when Democrats controlled both Chambers of Congress and the White House. it was not adopted. Health care should be patientcentered. allowing Americans to make decisions with their doctors and their families. not with the Federal Government. Instead of doubling down on ObamaCare. House Republicans want to see greater choice. more affordability. increased quality. and innovation in health care. which is why our budget proposes a marketbased. patientcentered reform. We also will provide structural reforms to Medicare and Medicaid. which provide care to our Nations seniors and those in need. The House Republican budget would make no changes for those who are near or currently in retirement. and provides States the flexibility to administer their Medicaid programs to meet the needs of the people in their own State. Doing nothing to reform this unsustainable path that Medicare and Medicaid are on. as this substitute amendment does. ensures that we will go bankrupt. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140023135,"Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. we are here today for two reasons: one. our constitutional duty assigned to us by the Constitution. and. two. to maintain the protections that same document ensures for all Americans. First. the Constitution mandates Congress oversee the District of Columbia. Article I. section 8. clause 17 makes clear Congresses exercises ""exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the District"" of Columbia. In that vein. Congress passed the Home Rule Act. which gives the District some autonomy. but Home Rule also retains the constitutional duty imposed on Congress to be the ultimate signoff for all of the Districts legislation. That responsibility could not be more important than today. The D.C. Council recently passed legislation that affects the hiring practices of organizations that work to advance certain beliefs. As passed. the bill fails to acknowledge certain longstanding constitutional protections of the First Amendment for political and religious organizations. Because of this. we cannot let this legislation stand. Former D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray requested the council postpone its vote on the bill because of its legal problems. In a December 2014 letter. Mayor Gray explained D.C.s attorney general found that the bill ""raised serious concerns under the Constitution and under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993."" He went on to say. ""Religious organizations. religiously affiliated organizations. religiously driven forprofit entities. and political organizations may have strong First Amendment and Religious Freedom Restoration Act grounds for challenging the laws application to them."" To remedy these problems. the Mayor requested the council include an exemption to ""protect the religious and political liberty interests that the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are designed to secure."" Madam Speaker. I will insert Mayor Grays December 2. 2014. letter to the D.C. Council into the RECORD. While the council postponed the vote. they took none of the Mayors advice. Once again. Mayor Gray wrote the council. again. in midDecember voicing his disapproval for the bill. In that letter. he suggested. ""If the council wishes to adopt this bill. it should clarify the D.C. Human Rights Acts existing exemption for religious and political organizations to ensure that that exemption protects the religious and political liberty interests that the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are designed to secure."" Mayor Gray concluded that. ""Without this language. I cannot support the legislation and believe that the council would expose the District government to costly legal challenges by moving forward."" Again. Madam Speaker. I will insert in the RECORD Mayor Grays December 17. 2014. letter to the D.C. Council. Despite these warnings. the council and Mayor Bowser ignored the former Mayors requests. passed the bill. and sent it to Congress. If they had taken Mayor Grays advice. we would not be here today. Madam Speaker. this law is contrary to the Federal statute. and the D.C. Council knows it. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed in 1993 prevents the government from creating any law. rule. or regulation that prevents an individual from freely exercising their religion. Based on this mandate. the Supreme Court recently held that certain corporations are not required to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs. From the way it was drafted. it is unclear if the D.C. bill violates this mandate. making it unconstitutional. Both Mayor Bowser and the D.C. Council know that this is a problem. In fact. in February. Mayor Bowser admitted that the bill was ambiguous and requested the council pass temporary emergency legislation clarifying that the bill doesnt require employers to provide insurance coverage for reproductive health decisions. Madam Speaker. I will insert in the RECORD Mayor Bowsers February 2. 2015. letter to the D.C. Council. Madam Speaker. that fix was only temporary and does not address the constitutional concerns I share with Mayor Gray. Given this ambiguity and no permanent fix. the bill is unconstitutional and cannot stand. given the recent Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby. Protecting the freedoms guaranteed by our First Amendment should not be a partisan issue. Mayor Gray knew this and pointed this out to the council that it has gone too far. Finally. Madam Speaker. I want to speak directly to the claims that this resolution is somehow an attack on womens health care or their rights to use contraceptives. These attacks are offensive and are patently false. As a registered nurse. I have spent my adult life bringing health care to women. children. and families. This resolution would in no way threaten anyones access to care or freedom from discrimination based on the use of contraceptives. rather. it simply maintains the status quo in Washington. D.C.. before this misguided law was passed. Women are already protected from discrimination on the basis of pregnancy status and a number of other fronts through both D.C. and Federal law. as they should be. Specific to concerns regarding how this would impact women using contraceptives. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission makes clear ""an employer could not discharge a female employee from her job because she uses contraceptives."" Those protections would in no way be impacted if any resolution were to be signed into law. Madam Speaker. the RHNDA law is fundamentally dishonest. It purports to be a nondiscrimination act. but it directly targets the fundamental First Amendment freedoms of employers in our Nations Capital. the very city charged with protecting those same freedoms. We must act to protect religious freedom and to offer relief from this oppressive RHNDA law."
1140025134,"Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. when I became a nurse more than 40 years ago. I took a vow to ""devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care."" but our understanding of the science limited to the extent to which I could fulfill that promise has evolved. During my first years of nursing. if a woman came into our hospital in labor at 32 weeks of pregnancy. our odds of saving her child were slim. However. today. babies are being saved as early as 22 weeks into fetal development. according to a study that was just released this past week by The New York Times. Whats more. there is significant evidence that. at 20 weeks of development. unborn children have the capacity to feel pain. Sadly. while we celebrate advances in technology that prove life has value and worth before leaving the hospital. we also continue to be one of only seven nations that allow elective. lateterm abortionsone of only seven nations around this world. It is difficult to imagine a more important measure of society than how it treats the most innocent and defenseless population. By condoning the destruction of unborn life that could otherwise live outside the womb. the United States tragically fails to meet this most fundamental human rights standard. Basic decency and human compassion demand that something has to change. Polls consistently show that upwards of 60 percent of Americans support putting an end to the dangerous and inhumane practice of lateterm abortions. To be clear. we have a mandate to act. That is why I strongly support the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act this week. which will provide Federal protection for an unborn child at 20 weeks. with exceptions to saving the life of the mother or in cases of rape and incest. Todays vote coincides with the 2year anniversary of the conviction of the evil abortionist. Kermit Gosnell. who killed babies born alive in his clinic and who is responsible for the death of an adult woman. Americans were rightfully outraged when they were told of his crimes. The truth is that innocent. unborn children routinely suffer that same fate as Gosnells victims did through ""normal"" lateterm abortions and the government does not bat an eye. The only difference between these casualties and the loss of life that resulted in Gosnells murder conviction is the location. Madam Speaker. if we cannot appeal to my proabortion lawmakers sense of compassion when it comes to this issue. then surely we can at least appeal to their senses of logic and fact. Knowing that premature babies are being saved as early as 22 weeks into fetal development. there is no legitimate reason to oppose this bill. In the year 2015. the United States has no business aborting a life that can live outside the womb. Science agrees and so do the majority of Americans. The PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act will right this wrong. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140042159,"Madam Speaker. it is an honor to be here and to be a part of todays Republican Womens Policy Committee on this Special Order on national security. and I want to thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for bringing us together on this very important topic. I rise today to specifically address the Presidents attempts to strike a deal with both Iran and Cuba. First. Iranafter four missed deadlines. President Obama announced a deal this morning with Iran. the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism and a nation whose Ayatollah famously called the United States ""the Great Satan."" It was a deal praised by the likes of Syria and Russia and condemned by our allies. such as Israel. What is more. under the agreement. international inspectors must ask Irans permission before reviewing its nuclear sites. by the way. after which. Iran has 2 weeks to decide whether to even grant it. All told. Iran would have 24 days to drag out this process and conceal signs of noncompliance. Instead of peace through strength. this agreement amounts to unrest through appeasement. Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. Congress does have the power to vote down a bad deal that threatens our national security. I believe this is a bad deal. and I intend to use what we can to show the President we do not support this deal. Unfortunately. the Presidents efforts to cozy up to rogue nations doesnt end there. President Obama is attempting to normalize relations with Cuba. Here again. the President is clearly more interested in striking a dealany dealrather than knowing the details of the deal. Consider this: Cuba was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism until the end of May. and now the President wants to open up an embassy on the shores of Havana. So can you tell me what has changed? Just last week I led nearly 20 of my colleagues in sending a letter to the President. citing a report from the Department of Homeland Security which found more than 21.000 Cuban nationals with felony convictions living within our borders. These individuals are rated by our Department of Homeland Security as a threat level 1. meaning that they are the worst of the worst. They have no legal status as they have been given orders to be removed. but they are roaming our streets because Cuba will not take back its criminals. Madam Speaker. if the President insists on opening the door to negotiations with tyrants like Raul Castro. the very least he could do is to force this nation to follow the law on this simple matter and take back these criminals into his own country. Listen. when it comes to Iran and Cuba. the President must put national security and the wellbeing of the United States before his political legacy. Again. I thank my colleague and friend from North Carolina for this Special Order today in order to bring these very important issues to the American people."
1140043774,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. Planned Parenthood has blood on its hands. Over the last week. we have seen multiple videos showing its employees brazenly discussing the harvesting of aborted babies tissues and organs. but the truth is Planned Parenthoods culture of depravity runs much deeper than these couple of videos. In my home State of Tennessee. Planned Parenthood. the supposed champion of safe abortions. sued to overturn our States informed consent and mandatory licensing laws. measures that were put in place to protect womens health and safety. When I authored an amendment to our State constitution allowing legislators to reinstate these protections. Planned Parenthood ran an illfated smear campaign attempting to confuse the facts and turn Tennesseans against the measure. You see. Planned Parenthood doesnt empower women. it deceives them at their most difficult and vulnerable moments. It values convenience over truth and profit over life. As a nurse. I have seen the big abortion industrys shameful tactics with my own eyes. That is why. for 2 years now. I have sponsored the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act to address one of Planned Parenthoods largest government revenue streams. I continue to urge passage of this legislation. but in light of these videos. we must take the fight a step further. For these reasons. I have just introduced the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015. legislation that would enact an immediate moratorium on all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood while Congress carries out a full investigation. I eagerly await the findings of this forthcoming investigation. but do you know what. Mr. Speaker. no matter what it reveals. here is the truth: Planned Parenthood has made a business out of destroying that which God has created. It performs over 327.000 abortions a year. all while receiving roughly $500 million in annual funding from the taxpayer dollar. The onesided relationship between Planned Parenthoods evergrowing bank account and American taxpayers must be severed.
1140099308,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 89. which takes a strong stand against the carbon tax that would hurt American families. workers. and job creators. As the President closes out his time in office. he would like nothing more than to ram through more of his harmful energy agenda. Just look at the Presidents budget this year. Among the $3.4 trillion in tax hikes he proposed. the President included a $10 per barrel tax on oil. This tax alone would cause gas prices to increase by an estimated 25 cents per gallon. With a carbon tax. there would be a tax hike on production. distribution. and the use of not only oil but also of natural gas and any other form of energy that emits carbon. Such a tax would have many serious impacts on our economy by making daytoday life more expensive for families throughout this country. First. a carbon tax could drive up the cost of energy for both the producers and the consumers. This translates to larger energy bills that eat up even more of Americans takehome pay. especially during the hottest and coldest months of the year. Second. a carbon tax would destroy wellpaying jobs throughout the American energy sectora sector that has fueled significant job growth throughout the country. Third. a carbon tax would deliver a direct hit to working families and have compound effects that would reach all corners of the economy. In fact. a carbon tax would increase the cost of. virtually. every good manufactured or service performed in the United States. including everyday necessities. If a good requires energy to make or transport. which most do. taxes on that energy are. essentially. a tax on that good. As a result. Americans would have to pay more for everythingfrom milk to clothing to school supplies. Finally. to make this bad idea even worse. we know that a carbon tax would hurt those who are living in poverty and those who are on fixed incomes more than anyone else. Put simply. a carbon tax would make it harder for us to grow our economy and help working families and small businesses succeed. We all want an alloftheabove energy approach that supports new innovations. not a targeted tax hike on specific industries. Thanks to the leadership of Whip SCALISE. Congress will pass this bill today and send it to the Senate. and we will send a clear message to the people in our districts. as well as to the Obama White House. that we do not support this extreme tax. Instead. we will continue to pass legislation that grows our economy and that helps more Americans get back to work. After all. last week. we received the worst jobs report in almost 6 years. It is more important than ever that we move forward with a bold. progrowth agenda. not another expensive Washington tax. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140108038,Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer an amendment to protect American workers and small manufacturing businesses from a misguided provision in a proposed EPA rule. Last year. the EPA released its phase 2 fuel efficiency and emissions standard for new medium- and heavyduty trucks. While many in the trucking industry are not opposed to the phase 2 rule as a whole. one section in the proposal wrongly applies these standards to what are known as glider kits. A glider kit is a group of vehicle parts that can include a brand new truck frame. cab. or axles. but which does not include an engine or transmission. Since a glider kit is less expensive to purchase than a new heavyduty truck and can extend the investment and working life of a truck. businesses and drivers with a damaged or older vehicle may choose to purchase a glider kit instead of buying a new one. Gliders extend the useful life of truck engines while frequently having a higher resale price against comparable trucks. Due to their rebuilt engines. they can also often be a more fuelefficient option. allowing trucking companies and drivers to use less fuel. Unfortunately. the EPA is proposing to apply the new phase 2 standards to glider kits even though gliders are not really new vehicles. Further. it is unclear whether the EPA even has the authority to regulate the replacement parts like gliders. While the EPAs stated goal with phase 2 is to reduce emissions. the agency has not studied the emissions impact of remanufactured engines and gliders compared to new vehicles. It appears the agencys actual motivation is to force businesses and drivers that would like to use glider kits to instead buy new trucks. Applying the phase 2 standards to glider kits would certainly harm the workers and owners in the glider industry. leading to possible closure of these businesses and job losses at both manufacturers and dealerships. Additionally. the EPAs rule would limit consumer choice in the marketplace. Under this proposal. many operators and businesses would simply choose to continue using current vehicles. leaving older trucks on the road longer. My amendment would protect these businesses and American manufacturing jobs by prohibiting the EPA from finalizing. implementing. administering. or even enforcing phase 2 standards on glider kits. To be clear. this amendment would notand I repeat. would notbar the EPA from implementing the whole phase 2 rule for medium and heavyduty trucks. It would simply clarify that glider kits and glider vehicles are not new trucks as the EPA claims. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to help support American manufacturing and stop the EPA from attempting to shut down the glider industry. Mr. Chair. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140108675,"I thank my colleague for yielding. Madam Speaker. I rise in strong support of the rule to allow for the consideration of my bill. S. 304. the Conscience Protection Act. The Members of this body represent a broad array of views on matters of life and abortion. But. surely. we can all at least agree on this: that nobody should ever be forced to participate in the act of abortion against ones will. That is what my legislation is about. As it stands today. the conscience rights of prolife Americans are not being consistently upheld. As a matter of fact. nurses have been required to assist in abortions despite their moral objections. and States like California and New York are now requiring every insurance plan. including those by churches and Christian universities. to include elective abortion coverage. This is wrong. Madam Speaker. I am a nurse. I have been so for more than 45 years. and I still keep my license today. I love my job. but I would never sacrifice my view on the sanctity of life in order to keep it. and I shouldnt have to. Being an American has always meant experiencing the freedom to live according to ones deeply held beliefs at home. at work. and in the public square. My bill simply ensures that that will remain the case. Think about it this way: a search of over 1.300 results for the phrase ""right to choose."" My colleagues across the aisle use that term often. Of course. their argument leaves no choice for the unborn child in the womb. but it stands to reason that if politicians will protect that right to choose. then they must protect the other right to choose as well. the right not to be a forced partner in the practice of abortion. That is simply what my bill would do. The government recognizes the importance of protecting conscience rights in other arenas: ObamaCare prohibits government discrimination against entities that do not participate in assisted suicide. and Federal employees are not required to participate in Federal death penalty executions. Why should abortion be any different? Madam Speaker. if Americans cant abide by their own consciences. particularly on a matter of a deeply held belief such as this. then we have lost one of our most basic freedoms there is. Just to reiterate that which has already been said. this bill does not change the law of today on abortion. It does not. I challenge my colleagues to show me in the language of the bill where it does. It will remain exactly the way it is. This bill does not affect womens access to abortion. As a matter of fact. even in the bill. we make sure that that access is still there in the bills language. and this bill does not affect employers in the services that they give to their employees. Today. we can change this. I urge a ""yes"" vote on the rule."
1140108738,"I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee. my colleague and my friend. Madam Speaker. I rise in strong support of my bill. S. 304. the Conscience Protection Act of 2016. This legislation would prevent governments from penalizing or in any way discriminating against a healthcare provider for its refusing to participate in an abortion. In doing so. it would codify an act. known as the Weldon amendment. which has been attached to the annual spending bill since 2004 with bipartisan support. Importantly. the bill would also take the law a step further in allowing for a civil right of action so that the victims of abortion discrimination would have their day in court. Today. if you believe you have been discriminated against on the basis of refusing to be involved in an abortion. you appeal to the Obama administrations Department of Health and Human Services. In the case of Cathy DeCarlo. a prolife nurse from New York who was forced by her employer to assist in the abortion of a 22week preborn baby. it took HHS 3 years to close its investigation into her case. In California. where the Department of Managed Health Care required all insurance plans in the State to offer the coverage of elective abortion. the HHS took 2 years to determine that no violation of the law had occurred. this despite the fact that the churches and the Christian universities are now required to subsidize abortion through their insurance plans. Congress must step in to clarify and to strengthen our laws so that the conscience rights of every American are protected. because. Madam Speaker. if we lose the right to live according to our own convictions. particularly on the matter as deeply affecting as abortion. we dont have much left. do we? After all. it was Thomas Jefferson who reminded us: ""No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of civil authority."" President Obama. himself. echoed this statement in 2009. saying. ""Lets honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion."" If my colleagues wont listen to the pleas of the prolife Americans who are asking for the protection of these most basic rights. maybe they will listen to the words of their own President. With this bill. I am not seeking to change anyones mind on abortion. though I hope that one day I can. I am not asking my colleagues to rule anyones abortion to be illegal. though every act of abortion absolutely breaks my heart. I am not asking my colleagues to withhold a dime from a single abortion provider. although I will continue to fight to stop the spending of my constituents dollars to the industries that take human life. Today I simply ask the Members of this body to allow the millions of Americans who believe as I doin the sanctity of every human lifeto abide by those beliefs without having them trampled upon by their own government. I urge a ""yes"" vote on this very compassionate. reasonable. and modest bill."

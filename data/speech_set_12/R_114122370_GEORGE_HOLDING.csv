1140022669,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of an important man of Americas Greatest Generation. Dr. Thomas Frank Johnson. He faced lifes challenges head on. and. throughout all of this vast change. he always saw Americas promise above all else. Dr. Johnson. a military veteran and influential economist. passed away last December at the age of 94 and was recently buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy in the Pacific from 1943 to 1945 and remained in the Navy Reserve until 1980. He was born September 27. 1920. in Lynchburg. Virginia. and was a child of the Great Depression. which affected his economic and personal outlook. His philosophy was simpleas he would tell his childrentime marches on. so must we. Dr. Johnson was extremely proud of his military service. However. as a humble man. he only displayed one picture of himself. on his patrol craft 1191 in the Pacific. escorting aircraft carriers and destroyers into battle. After the war. he remained in the Navy. traveling by train. bringing soldiers and sailors homesome to their families. some to hospitals. and some to their final resting places. While very proud of his service. he rarely ever spoke of his time there. He simply moved on to the next phase of his life in postWorld War II America. After concluding Active Duty. Dr. Johnson completed studies in economics at the University of Virginia and was a member of the Thomas Jefferson Society. He moved to Washington. D.C.. in 1949 and began his professional career at the Department of Agriculture. specializing in the sugar beet industry. followed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In the mid1950s. he served as the assistant commissioner of the Federal Housing Authority. in charge of research and legislation. He concluded his tenure at the Federal Housing Authority as acting commissioner. He then joined the American Enterprise Institute. where he influenced economic thought and public policy for another three decades. For those three decades. Dr. Johnson held senior leadership roles at the American Enterprise Institute. including director of economic policy studies. In his last year. he was the acting CEO. A man who did not seek the limelight. he had an uncanny ability to recruit and cultivate the foremost economic thinkers of our Nation. Dr. Johnson fostered the talent of at least three Nobel Prize winners in economics. including Milton Friedman. Jim Buchanan. and Gary Becker. Dr. Johnson influenced economic policy during seven Presidential administrations. He established a lunchtime forum for informal discussions with Cabinet Secretaries. financial leaders. and ambassadors. Even President George H.W. Bush would attend the forum. Mr. Speaker. Dr. Johnson was a humble and very forwardlooking man. While engaging with many world leaders and policymakers. he was always a very private person. seldom talking about himself. He also taught economics nearly his entire professional life at the University of Virginia. George Mason University. and George Washington University. Throughout his career. Dr. Johnson was active in professional societies such as the National Association of Business Economists. serving as chapter president in 1971. Institute for Social Science Research. Royal Economic Society. National Tax Association. American Finance Association. Southern Economic Association. and the Cosmos Club here in Washington. where he often took his children to meet important policymakers and leading economists of the Nation and the world. Mr. Speaker. Dr. Johnson was also deeply engaged in his local community. serving on the Alexandria Hospital board of directors. including a term as its president. He also proudly served on the Alexandria school board and the vestry for St. Pauls Episcopal Church and Immanuel ChurchontheHill Episcopal Church in Alexandria. Mr. Speaker. my thoughts and prayers are with his wife of 63 years. Margaret Ann. three children. Thomas. William. and the Reverend Sarah Nelson. and seven grandchildren. Dr. Thomas Frank Johnson will surely be missed. Mr. Speaker. I will submit for the RECORD an additional account of Dr. Johnsons life. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of an important man in American life. Dr. Thomas Frank Johnson was part of the ""Greatest Generation"". a time now referred to as the ""American Century"". He. like other nonagenarians. saw so much change during his life and faced lifes challenges head on. He witnessed a World War. a dozen presidents. the beginnings of commercial aviation and lunar landings. the construction and collapse of the Berlin Wall. the rise of China and India as world powers and other wonders. Throughout all of this vast change. he always saw above all else. Americas promise. We commend Dr. Johnsonan influential economist shaping this nations public policy and a veteranwho died December 28. 2014. at 94 years of age. He served as a Lt. Commander in the Navy in the Pacific from 1943 to 1945. He remained in the Navy Reserve until 1980. For nearly 30 years. Dr. Johnson held senior leadership roles at the American Enterprise Institute (195887). including director of economic policy studies and in his last year Acting CEO. A man who did not seek the limelight. he had an uncanny ability to recruit and cultivate the foremost economic thinkers. Dr. Johnson mentored numerous AEI scholarsproviding the ideas and discourseand then editing the publications of the nations preeminent economists and public policy planners including Jean Kirkpatrick. Carla Hills. Irving Krystal. Herb Stein. and Murray Wiedenbaum. Dr. Johnson fostered the talent of at least three Nobel Prize winners in Economics including Milton Friedman. Jim Buchanan. and Gary Beckerwellknown members of the Chicago School of Economic Thought. Because of Dr. Johnsons guidance and mentoring. other colleagues and assistants have also gone onto remarkable careers. Dr. Johnson was known as the ""Dean of AEI"" and influenced economic policy during seven presidential administrationsJohn F. Kennedy. Lyndon B. Johnson. Richard M. Nixon. Gerald R. Ford. Ronald W. Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Dr. Johnson established the AEI cafeteria. a lunchtime forum for informal discussions with cabinet secretaries. financial leaders. and ambassadors. George Herbert Walker Bush was a regular. Dr. Johnson published numerous articles of his own in professional journals and books such as Renewing Americas Cities. He served on the commission for urban renewal under three Virginia GovernorsLinwood Holton. Miles Godwin and Bob Dalton. In 1980. Virginia enacted a law that implemented most of commissions work with a $150 million appropriationan enormous sum at the timeto renew Virginias cities. He was a humble and very forwardlooking man. While engaging with many world leaders and policymakers. he was always a very private person seldom talking about himself. He mused why anyone would want to know about his past. He and his generation just didnt boastthey just faced life every day and moved into the future. Over 94 years. Dr. Johnson achieved significant professional. community. and personal accomplishments. He was born Sept 27. 1920. in Lynchburg. Virginia. and was a child of the Great Depression which affected his economic and personnel outlook. His family had several reversals of fortune. including the loss of their tobacco farm near Farmville. Virginia. As a result. he didnt believe in debt and paid cash for everything. including his home. His philosophy was simple. As he would tell his children. ""time marches on. so must we."" Dr. Johnson was extremely proud of his military service to our nation. However. as a humble man. he only displayed one picture of himselfon his ""Patrol Craft 1191"" in the Pacific escorting aircraft carriers and destroyers into battle. After the war. he remained in the U.S. Navy travelling by train bringing soldiers and sailors home: some to their families. some to hospitals. and some to their final resting places. While very proud of his service. he rarely ever spoke of that time. He simply moved onto his next Phasethe post World War II America. His generation witnessed terrible tragedies and atrocities. Because of these experiences. Dr. Johnson respected people of all origins recognizing their fate could have easily been his. He often told his children about friends and colleagues who experienced incredible wartime escapes and journeys from Eastern Europe and Asia to America. He helped many of these immigrants. refugees go onto successful lives in the United States. These harrowing experiences are why he never lost sight of Americas promise. After concluding active duty. Dr. Johnson completed studies in economics at the University of Virginia (B.A. 1943. M.A. 1947. and Ph.D. 1949) and was a member of the Thomas Jefferson Society. He also attended Lynchburg College (193941). Dr. Johnson moved to Washington. D.C. in 1949 and began his professional career at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (194951)specializing in the sugar industryfollowed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (195154). In the mid1950s. he served as Assistant Commissioner of the Federal Housing Authority (195458) in charge of research and legislation during the implementation of the urban renewal provisions of the National Housing Act of 1954. He concluded his tenure at the Federal Housing Authority as Acting Commissioner. This was a time of incredible American renewal in which he played such an important role in shaping. He then joined AEI where he influenced economic thought and public policy for another three decades. Dr. Johnson taught economics nearly his entire professional life at the University of Virginia. George Mason University. and George Washington University. He also lectured at dozens of campuses throughout the country. He was responsible for bringing scholars to George Mason and helping to establish its economics and law schools. Throughout his career. Dr. Johnson was active in professional societies such as the National Association of Business Economists. serving as chapter president in 1971. Institute for Social Science Research. Royal Economic Society (U.K.). National Tax Association. American Finance Association and the Cosmos Club in Washington. D.C.. where he often took his children to meet important policymakers and leading economists. Dr. Johnson was also deeply engaged in the local community serving on the Alexandria Hospital Board of Directors from 1965 to 1971. including a term as its president (19701971). As a patient. he never mentioned his leadership on the hospital boardeven when getting a new pacemaker on his 90 birthday! He also proudly served on the Alexandria School Board (19741976) and the vestry for St. Pauls Episcopal Church and Emmanuel Church on the Hill Episcopal Church in Alexandria. As we remember Dr. Johnson. with his family present today in the Well of the House Chamber. it was this humble member of the Greatest Generation and his contributions that made the American Century possible. He is survived by his wife of 63 years Margaret Ann (Emhardt). three children Thomas Emhardt (Julianne Mueller). William Harrison (Tracy Schario). and the Rev. Sarah Nelson. and seven grandchildrenGaelen. Caleb. Eliza. Keegan. and Maren Nelson and Natalie and garret Johnson. We owe Dr. Johnson and his peers deep gratitude for their achievements and their couragefacing down incredible challenges. We live in the greatest country in the world because of men like Dr. Johnsonones that always believed in Americas promise for the future."
1140037843,"Mr. Speaker. the Obama administration and Tehran are yet again running up against another deadline. This one comes next Tuesday when the clock expires on reaching a comprehensive nuclear deal. Mr. Speaker. if you head over to whitehouse.gov. there is a site outlining the current nuclear negotiations. On the front page of this Web site. when discussing what a possible deal with Iran should do. it states: ""prevent Iran from using the cover of negotiations to continue advancing its nuclear program as we seek to negotiate a longterm comprehensive solution that addresses all of the international communitys concerns."" Mr. Speaker. what have we seen in reality? It is a possible deal that could block international inspectors from having unrestricted access to all of Irans nuclear sites to verify their compliance. Mr. Speaker. what could Iran possibly have to hide if their nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes? We have also seen a deal that doesnt require Iran to disclose all of its previous nuclear work and possible military dimensions. It is a bad deal because. if Iran expects the world to trust them and lift sanctions. why not come clean? I also see a deal that could lift all sanctions once the ink is dried. which is a bad deal. because what would this instant relief be rewarding? Years of covert work. violations of U.N. resolutions. and the export of terror across the globeno one in good faith could say that the deal before the world right now prevents Iran from obtaining a pathway to the bomb. If anything. Mr. Speaker. it puts them on a pathway to the bomb. It has been clear for some time now that this administration has been negotiating not with Iran. but with itself. We have seen them consistently move the goalpost on what they are willing to accept with respect to essential components of a good deal. This ranges from the number of centrifuges to inspections to the dismantling of nuclear infrastructure. The parameters of what this administration is willing to accept has moved so many times. I dont believe it would surprise anyone if reports emerged before next Tuesday that showed even more concessions have been made. Mr. Speaker. the administration needs to prevent Iran from having a pathway to the bomb. They need to hold good on their word that no deal is better than a bad deal. Mr. Speaker. I dont see how anyone right now. with the exception of Iran. could accept the reported deal as a ""good deal."" Lets not settle for a bad deal. lets not stand for a nuclear Iran."
1140072418,Mr. Speaker. on New Years Day. we mourned the loss of a great lady. Barbara Stockton Perry. Today I rise to celebrate Barbaras 89 years of life that she devoted to her Christian faith. to her family. and to her community. Barbara was born on November 3. 1926. in the town of Franklin. which is a small North Carolina mountain community that is tucked away under the Great Smoky Mountains. Though the population was very small. Barbara had a large personality and a keen mind. She was the valedictorian of Franklin High School in 1943. and she graduated cum laude from Brenau College in 1947. [ 1030 She then went on to the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill School of Law. She was the only woman in the class of 1950. and she was a member of the law review as well. This was classic Barbara. distinguishing herself as a highly intelligent woman who was not afraid to break glass ceilings. Barbaras first position out of law school was as assistant legal counsel to the Belk Stores Corporation in Charlotte. Then. after marrying Warren Perry in June of 1951. she moved to Kinston. North Carolina. with him and became a partner at Perry. Perry and Perry law firm. There. she became involved in the State bar and the local bar and was named to the Board of Governors of the North Carolina Bar Association. Community service was important to Barbara. So throughout her life. she donated her time and efforts to a long list of organizations. including the United Way. the North Carolina Symphony. the Kinston Arts Council. the KinstonLenoir County Bicentennial Commission. and the Pride of Kinston organization. A lifelong educational advocate. Barbara also served on the Board of Trustees of Parrot Academy. Lenoir Community College. Brenau University. and UNCChapel Hill. where she was elected to two terms on the Board of Governors of the entire 16university UNC system. In recognition of her contributions to North Carolina. she was honored by two North Carolina Governors. Jim Holshouser and Pat McCrory. Both of these Governors awarded her the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. If ever anyone instilled and fostered pride in the great State of North Carolina. certainly it was Barbara Stockton Perry. Ever devoted to faith. Barbara served for many years on the board of Angel Ministries. She was a longtime member of the Gordon Street Christian Church and more recently joined the Faith Fellowship Church. While her contributions to her community are beyond measure. Barbaras true joy was her family. She lost the love of her life. Warren. in 2003. but theirs was a life filled with adventure. By all accounts. they traveled the world together and shared a dance on all seven continents. At home. this extraordinary lady was known to her family simply as Mama Perry. She was happiest when she was surrounded by her children. grandchildren. and extended family. Mr. Speaker. it is impossible to condense the life of this truly remarkable woman into a few short minutes. I will close in saying that I was honored and privileged to know her. and I give thanks to Barbara Perry for devoting her life to her family. her community. and her faith. She will be missed beyond measure. May God always bless her.
1140078565,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the life and work of Goldsboros own George Collins Jeffreys. who passed away on January 20. Born over 90 years ago. in 1925. George lived a long and full life. The eldest of four children. he attended St. Marys School and Oak Ridge Military Academy in Oak Ridge. North Carolina. During the Second World War. George served in the Pacific. After the war. George returned home to work in the family business. which was originally established back in the 1890s by two prominent North Carolina families to market local produce. chickens. seed. and eggs. The business was successful. In the 1920s. Georges father and uncle took over the business. renaming it Jeffreys and Sons. The two brothers began offering beverage distribution. After the end of prohibition. they became a licensed distributor for AnheuserBusch products. It wasnt long before the company had grown so big that it was divided into separate seed. beverage. and cabinet companies. It continued growing and expanding in Goldsboro. Greenville. and other communities. Today. R.A. Jeffreys Distributing Company is the oldest AnheuserBusch distributor in North Carolina as well as one of the oldest familyowned distributors in the United States. R.A. Jeffreys Distributing Company services almost every grocery store. convenience store. and restaurant in the area. supplying 36 counties in North Carolina. Now. George Jeffreys was not only respected as a business leader. He was a thoughtful and generous member of his community. volunteering and contributing to local schools. Scout troops. churches. and community programs. In addition to his company being recognized multiple times as an outstanding wholesaler by AnheuserBusch. receiving the Dimensions of Excellence Award. George also received the Distinguished Service Award from the Tuscarora Council of the Boy Scouts of America. His dedication to business and to his community were certainly highlights of his long and full life. But the true foundation of George Jeffreys life was his family. His wife Lucy and his three childrenhis daughters. Leigh and Ellen. and his son Robertand seven grandchildren will all remember him with love. Mr. Speaker. I am honored to call George Jeffreys a friend. I pray for Gods blessings and Gods peace to his family.
1140083207,Mr. Speaker. the United States is fortunate to have allies and partners across the world that we work with every day to combat terrorism and our other security challenges. One of these relationships that I work closely on is the strategic partnership between the United States and India. Together. the U.S. and India face a set of common security challenges. and there can be no question that closer defense and security cooperation between our two democracies will greatly benefit all of our people. Over the last few years. Mr. Speaker. we have seen substantial growth in this partnership. most recently formalized last year with the 10year renewal of the defense framework. This partnership is also highlighted by forums such as the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative. I firmly believe that Congress should be supporting and offering more opportunities for the U.S.-India defense partnership to succeed. [] 1015 That is why today I will be introducing the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Partnership Act. This legislation will cement the progress that has already been made and will lay the foundation for future cooperation and growth. Additionally. this legislation will elevate Indias status by shortening the time required for the notification of sale or export of defense articles from the United States to India. It will also bring our defense establishment closer together by encouraging more joint contingency planning and will require the U.S. Government to review and assess Indias ability to execute military operations of mutual interest. Just as important as efforts like the legislation I am introducing today. I believe. is Congress closer examination and oversight of other actions that impact the U.S.-India partnership. One that certainly comes to mind. Mr. Speaker. is the delicate and. at times. seemingly confused policy with Pakistan. Pakistan has proven time and time again that it is an unreliable partner. While Pakistan has taken some. but very limited. action to disrupt terror elements that operate within their borders. their demonstrated unwillingness to fulfill and execute counterterrorism efforts should leave no question as to their true intentions. So why. Mr. Speaker. last month. did the administration notice a sale of eight F16s to Pakistan? What. I ask. is the benefit of the sale to our national security and the security of the region and our partners? This is one question. Mr. Speaker. But the request to use taxpayer dollars to finance the sale of these F16s to Pakistan is entirely another question. What has Pakistan actually done to deserve these fighter jets. let alone financing from the United States taxpayers? Certainly not enough. in my view. as I firmly oppose the sale from start to finish. Every year since 2011. the administration has been required to utilize a waiver to continue providing security assistance to Pakistan. Why. you might ask. does the administration need to continually use a waiver? Well. it is because Pakistan has failed to be an honest and real partner in the efforts to combat terrorism that is exported from its borders. On this front. Mr. Speaker. I have joined with Congressman BERA to seek a restriction on the availability of security assistance to Pakistan next fiscal year. We are not seeking to completely prohibit the use of the Presidential waiveralthough. I might add. this is a debate worth having here in the House. We are simply asking that 30 percent of the funds should not be subject to a waiver. This is a commonsense step that will. hopefully. after years of trying. get the Pakistani Government to cooperate and meet the requirements set in law. Mr. Speaker. India should know that they have a strong and committed partner in the U.S. Congress. and I believe that steps such as passing the appropriations fence I just outlined and passing the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Partnership Act would send a strong message and certainly enhance our strategic partnership with India. Mr. Speaker. we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us right now to further build an enduring defense and security partnership with India that will endure for years to come and. indeed. benefit both of our great democracies.
1140099972,Mr. Speaker. when most folks hear or think about the Internal Revenue Service. I am sure they probably think about the April 15 deadline. Maybe they even think about the prospects of an audit. or. in most cases. I imagine people are thinking about and wondering. you know. when is their tax refund going to be delivered? [ 1115 Or perhaps their minds might jump to the scandals that have plagued the IRS. from the targeting of conservative groups to the IRS failures to keep track of employee emails. Whatever the case. Mr. Speaker. I dont believe most people would immediately associate the IRS as a Federal law enforcement agency. However. the IRS is. in fact. home to our Nations sixth largest law enforcement agency. It is called the IRS Criminal Investigation. or CI. for short. CI was originally known as the IRS Intelligence division. and it was formed in 1919 to combat widespread corruption and organized crime. A great example of that from the early days is the investigation and conviction of Al Capone. Now. today. CI is solely responsible for the enforcement of criminal violations of our Nations tax laws and shares jurisdiction over violations of money laundering and bank secrecy laws. In addition. CI has also become an indispensable tool used in the investigation of terror financing cases and works jointly with many of our other Federal law enforcement agencies. Now. Mr. Speaker. I was a United States attorney for a number of years. and I have had the privilege of working with many CI special agents and personally know the value of their unmatched financial investigatory abilities. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. the IRS mismanagement of CI and their inability to prioritize CIs needs has caused a troubling drop in the number of CI special agents and staff. This. in turn. has led to a reduction in the number of Cs investigations and convictions at a time when offenses such as identity theft. money laundering. tax fraud. and terror financing are all on the rise. These resource decisions. along with an organizational and reporting structure at the IRS that is poorly suited to oversee a Federal law enforcement agency. have demonstrated that the IRS is illequipped to effectively support and manage CI. Mr. Speaker. simply put. we need to be placing a premium on the worldclass financial investigations CI carries out each day. This is why. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to have recently introduced the CI Realignment Act. This legislation. which I am pleased is supported by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. will create a new Bureau of Criminal Investigation within the Department of the Treasury by transferring CI out of the IRS. Mr. Speaker. first and foremost. this legislation is about law enforcement. It is about the dedicated personnel at CI that work in offices across the country and. indeed. across the world. While this House will continue to have discussions and consider necessary reforms and legislation to right the ship over at the IRS. the CI Realignment Act is concerned with creating a clear distinction between the civil IRS function and the Federal law enforcement agency charged with criminal enforcement of our Nations laws. Most importantly. Mr. Speaker. my legislation will remove CI from the bureaucracy of the scandalridden IRS and allow for an increased focus on law enforcement. Mr. Speaker. it is clear that the IRS urgently needs to address their shortfalls in many areas. from consumer service to data protection. Lets make certain that they do not further impede the critical work of our Nations top financial investigators while they try to figure out how to run the IRS.

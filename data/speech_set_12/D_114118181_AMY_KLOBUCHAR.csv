1140014432,Mr. President. I am here today for two reasons. One is to manage the bill at hand for the next few hours. and the other is to talk a little bit about Loretta Lynch. and how I hope we can resolve both these issues. I believe when it comes to the human trafficking bill on the floor. as well as my bill. the safe harbor billwhich is not the one on the floor. but it is also a strong bipartisan bill that passed out of the Judiciary Committee with every single person voting for it. 20 to 0. I want to talk a little bit about the bill so people dont forget it. It is expected to be an amendment to the bill on the floor when we get these issues resolved. I am hopeful that at some point hereand I hope it is todaywe are going to turn the corner on some of the language we have been hearing on the floor. I think it is becoming a sad situation. especially sad for the victims of trafficking. and I think we have a moment in time today and tomorrow where we can actually work on this and try to resolve it. I believe this great august body. which has dealt with many large issues in the past100 people who I think have come to this place with good willshould be able to resolve it in some way. get through this. and get this bill done. As we continue to work on the issues with the bill at hand. Senator CORNYNS bill. I also want to talk about the bill I have and why both these bills are important and actually work together. On trafficking. First. we know the numbers. More than 27 million people around the world are victims of some kind of trafficking each year. It is not always sex trafficking. Sometimes it is labor trafficking and other things. When it comes to sex trafficking. the average age of a victim when she is trafficked is 13 years old. She is not even old enough to go to a high school prom. not even old enough to get a drivers license. When you look at the statistics around the world. it is the third biggest international criminal enterprise in the world. The first is the illegal trafficking of drugs. I dont think that is a surprise. The second is the illegal trafficking of guns. and the third is the illegal trafficking of children. mostly little girls. But what people dont always realize when they think about traffickingI think they often think about kids who are found in the bottom of a boat. That does happen. horrible stories like that. But when it comes to the United States of America. 83 percent of the victims83 percent of the victimsare from our own country. They are from our own country. They are girls such as Tamara Vandermoon of Minnesota. She was 12 when she was first sold for sex. She was not even a teenager. She was just mad at her mom. and she ran away. A pimp found her and made her all kinds of promisespromises that sounded pretty good when you are a scared kid away from home. It happened when she was the most vulnerable. He took advantage of her before she even had a chance to grow up and be an adult. She has worked to change her life around through services and help in our State. Our State has been the leader in this area. That is one of the things why I introduced the safe harbor bill. which I hope will be the first amendment to this bill after we resolve these issues. My bill also is sponsored with Senator CORNYN. He and I have worked together on this bill. Another examplebecause people always use numbers. I used a bunch of numbers at the beginning of this speech. but I think sometimes people know behind those numbers. every single one of those numbers. is a child. Two weeks ago. out of the U.S. Attorneys office in Minnesota. our case was charged. and it happened a few months ago. It was a 12yearold in Rochester. MN. which is an idyllic community. a beautiful place. This little 12yearold got a text. She was with a girl who was a little older than herself. The text invited them to a party. She thought that was pretty cool. She goes to the McDonalds parking lot. She is at the McDonalds parking lot. and this pimp puts her in the car. She thinks she is going to a party. She gets carted up to the Twin Cities. She gets raped. He takes sexually explicit pictures of her. He puts them on Craigslist. She gets sold the next day to two other guys. raped by two other guys. Finally they were able to track down this perpetrator. He has been charged with a very serious crime by the U.S. Attorneys office. This happened in Minnesota. We can ask Senator HEITKAMP. who has been involved in this issue. It happens in the oil patches in North Dakota. It happens on the streets of Washington. DC. It happens all over this country. We may say. why is everyone talking about this now in this day and age? I look at this. as a former prosecutor. as back when people viewed domestic violence as a crime that was behind doors. that no one wanted to talk about it. and no one realized it was a crime. They thought of it as a family issue. When we start seeing kids who are in situations of domestic violence are multiple times more likely to commit crimes themselves because they grow up seeing it. we realize it is not just an issue between two people. As horrible as the injuries are to the immediate victim. it is also an issue for their entire family and for the entire community. We learned that about domestic violence. We learned that about child abuse. Now we are starting to see this about trafficking. We cant have a 12yearold who is a criminal. right? The 12yearold is a victim of this. The 12yearold doesnt know what they are doing. They are only 12 years old. but they are a victim. they are not a criminal. That is the focus of the Safe Harbor Act. I want to thank my colleague. Republican ERIK PAULSEN in the House. who has taken this bill on. We have worked together on it. A version of it has passed the House. We like ours a little bit better because it has the national sex trafficking strategy in it. and that is the bill we are going to be putting on as an amendment. ERIK has been a true leader on this issue. and we just talked yesterday about it. This bill actually now hasa version of it. my safe harbor billhas passed the House twice. It doesnt have the issues with the Hyde amendment. Hopefully it will be the first bill. the first amendment. when we resolve these other issues. What does the bill do? What it does is looks at what has been working in States across the country. According to a report by Polarisa group that is among many groups as a leader on sex traffickingit shows that 15 States across the country have taken these safe harbor laws. The laws basically say we are not going to treat these kids as criminals. We are going to make sure they are treated as victims. that they get the services they need. And mostly then from a law enforcement perspectivefrom someone who was a prosecutor for 8 years. ran an office of 400 people and saw these cases coming in and out of our doors all the timewhat it means is these victims will then better testify against the people whom we want to get. Those are the perps. Those are the people running the rings. Those are the johns who are buying the sex. By having this approach. we have a much better chance of going after the people who are doing this. The Ramsey County attorneys office out of St. Paul. MN. with their leader John Choi. was able to get a 40year sentence last year of someone who was running one of these rings. We have had numerous prosecutions in Minnesota. This idea of having a shelter. a place for the victims to gobecause otherwise what is going to happen if they dont think they are going to get help or maybe get some job training. have a place to stay. they are going to go right back to the pimp. and then they are not going to be willing to testify and tell their story. That is what has happened through history. and that has enabled the rings to get worse and worse. The other thing we know that has enabled them to get worse is the Internet. We love the Internet. but it has allowed people to market things on all kinds of Web sites and in all kinds of devious ways. They are able to sell young girls and young boys on these Web sites. They get a text and they show up and think they are going to a party. That is what is happening. It is behind closed doors and it is hidden. That is one of the reasons we are seeing this increase and these problems coming up. in addition to the realization we are not going to tolerate this anymore. We have 15 States across the country that already have the safe harbor laws. Another 12 States are making good progress in this direction. It is not starting from scratch. As I said. my home State is one of the first ones. but we are seeing them. What our bill does is create incentives for States to adopt these kinds of laws. It is not involving a lot of money. It is taking existing programs and trying to create incentives so that States will adopt these laws. The other piece of the bill is that it allows victims of these crimes to qualify for certain Federal job programs that they may not qualify for now. It also creates a national strategy. as I mentioned. to combat human trafficking. I always found when I was a prosecutor that people didnt care who took on the case. whether it was a local prosecutor or the State AG or the U.S. Attorneys office. They just wanted people to get the job done. They didnt actually understand the jurisdictional divisions. By making this national sex trafficking strategy the ideaand I have seen this with the Violence Against Women Actit may not be that we are mandating people do a certain thing. but we put out there some best practices that local offices can cover. We look at what is working in certain States. Then we put those out there because we have a national sex trafficking strategy. and we give people ideas of what they can do best. Those are parts of the bill. It is pretty straightforward. Again. it is not the bill on the floor right now which. of course. has an important purpose. to help fund some of the shelters and pay for it by an increase on the fees on perpetrators. but it is a part of the solution. Another part of the solution we havent talked too much about over the last few days. because there have been a lot of other things going on. I think we have to also remember the role of the private sector. We certainly have seen this in our State. where Marilyn Carlson Nelson. who is a wonderful business leader. headed up Carlson Companies for many years. Carlson Companies owns the Radisson Hotels. She has made training of her workforce a major part of this because it is the people on the frontlineand you can see Delta and all the others. American. United. a lot of the airlines are making this a priority as well. They are training their workers because they are on the frontline. and they are going to see this happen. They are going to see the victims. They are going to figure out something is going on that is wrong. so they can at least report it to their hotels security or whatever authorities they think they need to. they can stop it right there on the ground floor and report it to the authorities. We shouldnt forget that. Because unless these private sector entities who see it happening come forwardthis isnt in any of our bills. This is something they are doing on their own. Unless they do that. we can have all the laws we want on the books. but it is really hard to catch these things from happening. I am proud of the work they have done. My good friend Cindy McCain. HEIDI HEITKAMP. and I went to Mexico last spring with the major focus on sex trafficking. We met with the attorney general of Mexico and met with the head of their law enforcement in Mexico City about this very topic. Because Mexico. along with many other countries. has girls who do come in and are brought in for purposes of sex trafficking. I do want to emphasize. however. this is not just an international problem. but over 83 percent of the victims are from our country. But they have been coordinating with us on a number of successful prosecutions by giving us information so when the cases come to the United States. we view this. They have their own internal problems with this and other things as well. obviously. in Mexico. We went there not to say you are doing something wrong. We went there to say we have our own problems. and so do you. Lets figure out how we can work together on this issue. Again. Cindy McCain is an example of someone who on the private side has been very involved with her foundation in working on this issue and helping with shelters and other things. The private sector piece of this. they can be called trafficking facilitators. unknowingly. because they are allowing this to happen. But in a way. they are a major part of the solution. I do not want us to forget that as we go forward and as they work with us to address the needs of the victims. and mostly to be able to catch these cases and bring them to law enforcement. That is kind of a tour through what the safe harbor bill does. Again. Senator CORNYN and I have talked about it being the first amendment to the bill. I am very aware that we need to work out the issues on the underlying bill. and I am hopeful after days of acrimony that at some point we are going to be able to work together. I am hoping there will be a different flavor to peoples discussions about this issue today.
1140023559,"Mr. President. I rise today in strong support of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that is before the Senate today. I thank Senator CORKER and Senator CARDIN for their incredible work bringing people together on the Foreign Relations Committee. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill as written. We must move forward to pass this legislation as quickly as possible to ensure that Congress has a role in reviewing any proposed nuclear agreement with Iran. This is a critically important bill at a critically important time. Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is one of the most important objectives of our national security policy. and I strongly supported the sanctions every step of the way that brought Iran to the negotiating table. I have also supported the diplomatic efforts to address the threat posed by Irans nuclear program. The framework that was reached in Switzerland earlier this month is a positive step forward. but I think we all know that this process is far from complete. There are so many unanswered questions on the military dimensions of Irans nuclear program. on how its uranium stockpile would be handled. under what circumstances any sanctions relief would be provided. and the timing of that relief. It is clear that there are still differences between Iran and the rest of the international community on these issues. I believe it is important that negotiations continue to pursue a final agreement by June 30 that comprehensively addresses the threat posed by Irans nuclear program. Again. one of the most important objectives of the U.S. national security policy is to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The bipartisan legislation before us today will set up a process for Congress to review any final nuclear agreement with Iran. It ensures that Congress. which through its actions brought Iran to the table. will have access to all the final details of the agreement. It preserves our right to have a final say in the potential lifting of the sanctions that we led on. That is how we were involved in compelling Iran to negotiate in terms of these sanctions. Senators CORKER and CARDIN worked so hard to strike a careful balance between the Executives prerogative to pursue the negotiations and Congresss role in reviewing any nuclear agreement. Their negotiations were a success. as I said. The bill passed the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously. 19 to 0. 2 weeks ago. That is a committee with a number of Senators with a broad range of views on every issue. including foreign relations and including these negotiations. The President. who had long threatened to veto any such bill. has agreed to sign it. This is a significant victory for the Senate and also for congressional oversight of foreign policy. something many of us have been pushing for. Any nuclear agreement with Iran will have significant longterm implications for the United States. for Israel. and for our allies in the region. So it is critical that Congress have the opportunity to review it. This bill ensures that we have that opportunity. That is why it is so important that we act now to pass this legislation without delay and without amendments that undercut the bipartisan agreement on this bill. Right now. I understand there are negotiations over a number of amendments that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to offer. I think we know that a number of these amendments appear to be written in a way that would undermine the bipartisan support for the bill or would somehow make this bill much more difficult in terms of having a process. All this bill is. from my mind. is a process to review. Instead of having a haphazard process. this actually gives Congress something for which we have been asking for a long time. It has given us that ability to review this agreement and have a vote on it. I dont know how many times I have heard my colleagues from the other side of the aisle talk about itand my colleagues on this side of the aisle. We finally have a bipartisan way to do it. So I think we need to be very careful when moving forward and look at some of these amendments. I certainly share my colleagues deep mistrust and skepticism of the Iranian regime. I am appalled by the continuing human rights abuses. the unjustified detention of American citizenseveryone. from the Washington Post reporter to a former marine to a Christian pastor. I abhor the vicious threats we are hearing against Israel and against Israeli leaders. the track record supporting antiSemitism and the Holocaust denial. I am deeply concerned about the destabilizing actions in the region. including Irans efforts to obtain more advanced missiles. and the support for militant forces and terrorists. I think we all know the issues that are going on here. It is incredibly important that we work to address these issues. but there must be a recognition of the fact that what we are talking about here is a nuclear agreement. I think every Senator is going to want to look at that agreement and say: Does this make things safer or not? What effect does this have on Israel? Is it safer to have Iran have nuclear capabilities when they have shown the propensity to do all of these other things that I have just mentioned? I think many of us come down on the side that we want to see this agreement but we are pleased these negotiations are going on. We are particularly thankful that Senator CORKER and Senator CARDIN were able to come to an agreement on a process and to get that agreement through a highly diverse committee in terms of their political views and to get that agreement through on a 19to0 vote. Also. I might add that we dont want to revive the threat of a Presidential veto here. I know many of these amendments sound appealing to many of us but not if they are going to be used as a way to bring down this process. the review agreement. and that is essentially what would happen. We do not want to be damaging our own ability to ensure that sanctions relief will only come from a strong agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I would think that outcome would certainly be fine with the Iranians. if that is what happens. As our Republican colleague from South Carolina. LINDSEY GRAHAM. pointed out recently. ""Anybody who offers an amendment that will break this agreement apart . . . the beneficiary will be the Iranians."" So lets not give the Iranians a victory. Lets pass this bill on a strong bipartisan vote. and lets do it now so it is clear that Congress stands united and we want the ability to review this agreement. Our foreign policy is more effective when we speak with one voice. It may be simplistic to say that politics should stop at the waters edge. but when it comes to Iran. the fact is. we have been unified. The past three votes in favor of major sanctions legislation in 2010. 2011. and 2012 have been unanimous99 to 0. 100 to 0. and 94 to 0 respectively. And now the Iranians are at the table negotiating a nuclear agreement. That is because we stood together across party lines. We have stood together and been strong and unified as a country. The time has come to show we are serious againserious about ensuring that a final agreement is strong and enforceable and. most importantly. blocks Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. We may not agree on everything. but we must certainly agree on something that so many of us have been talking abouta role for the Congress. a role for the Senate in having a say over this agreement. That is all this bill is about. Passing this bill will show our commitment to our countrys security and the security of our allies and our partners. It transcends partisan politics. and that is something that. when it comes to foreign relations and when it comes to dealing with a country such as Iran. must stop at the waters edge. I thank our colleagues. Senator CORKER and Senator CARDIN. for working so hard to negotiate this agreementsimply a process of reviewso that we can finally have a say. and I ask my colleagues to support this. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140036723,Mr. President. I wish to recognize the Minnesota Orchestra and its music director. Osmo Vinski. for the ensembles recent visit to Cubathe first major American orchestra to do so since President Obama announced efforts to normalize our Nations relationship with Cuba. The Minnesota Orchestra last visited Cuba in 1930. when it was known as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. For more than a century. the Minnesota Orchestra has demonstrated a deep commitment to innovation and diversity. and this visit is just the latest example. During its whirlwind visit. the orchestra won the hearts and minds of music lovers across the island nation. The performances were met with applause and acclaim. and they illustrated the importance of strengthening the cultural bonds between our countries and our people. In Cuba. there is a real eagerness for the persontoperson contact that has been blocked for decades. This trip signified real steps towards forming those crucial relationshipsproving that music is a language that reaches beyond cultural. political. and geographical barriers to unite us all. I commend the Minnesota Orchestra for its willingness and initiative to take part in this historic cultural moment. Since its inception in 1903. the Minnesota Orchestra has promoted new ideas. new connections. and new music. Under Mr. Vinskiis leadership. this orchestra has risen in the ranks to become one of the top symphonic ensembles in America. and I am proud that it calls Minnesota home. The orchestra has become a visionary leader in the world of symphonic and classical music. stretching beyond what other ensembles imagine is possible. in order to achieve excellence in its field. I hope my colleagues will join me as I commend the Minnesota Orchestra. its Musical Director Osmo Viinskdi and all of the talented musicians and dedicated staff on this historic tour of Cuba. and for more than a century of performing and producing beautiful music enjoyed not just in Minnesota but around the world.*
1140041180,Mr. President. I rise today to talk about the important bill before us today. the Every Child Achieves Act. which reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and fixes No Child Left Behind. I also rise today to talk about the reauthorization of the ExportImport Bank. which is also a very important matter for our country. I thank Senators ALEXANDER and MURRAY for their great leadership in crafting a bipartisan bill that makes critical updates to No Child Left Behind that will help ensure that all students receive a quality education. They worked together from the very beginning on this important bill. and I think the results show how important it is. I come to the floor to talk about three amendments in this bill. The Presiding Officer is a cosponsor on one of the amendments. which is about STEM education. I think we all know that in todays global economy. education is key to our economic prosperity. The Senator from North Dakota understands that because our two States. North Dakota and Minnesota. have some of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. We have exciting economies with technological jobs to fill. We are two States that make and invent products which we then export to the world. To keep doing that. Americas next generation of innovators will have to be highly trained and highly skilled. We certainly see this in my State. According to the Minnesota High Tech Association. Minnesota will be home to nearly 200.000 technology jobs in the next decade. Part of this is getting young people engaged at an early age. Todays high school students arent just competing against students in Milwaukee and Miami. they are competing against students in Munich and Mumbai. If America is going to keep its spot atop the worlds hightech hierarchy. students in our country must receive the best training and education we can provide. That is why Senator HOEVEN and I are working to increase the emphasis on STEM education. The KlobucharHoeven amendment. modeled after our Innovate America Act. will expand STEM opportunities for more students by allowing school districts to use existing Federal STEM funding to create STEM specialty schools or to enhance existing STEM programs within the schools. Our provision will also ensure that the Department of Education is aligning STEM programs and resources with the needs of school districts and teachers. I understand that it is in the managers package. and I thank the two leaders for that. The second amendment is the improving teacher and principal retention. The Every Child Achieves Act includes important reforms to improve the quality of education for students in Indian Country. One challenge that schools serving Native Americans continue to confront is the high rate of teacher and principal turnover and the instability it causes. Turnover hurts school districts with the added cost of rehiring and retraining. and it hurts kids as teachers come and go. One way to decrease teacher and principal turnover is to boost the professional development these teachers receive. Inadequate professional development and the lack of ongoing support are some of the key reasons why some of our best teachers are leaving. That is why Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska and I have been pushing a provision to improve teacher and principal retention in schools serving American Indian and Alaska Native students. Specifically. our amendment adds mentoring and teacher support programs. including instructional support from tribal elders and cultural experts. to improve the professional development that teachers and principals in Indian schools receive. This is also in the managers package. and we appreciate that. The next amendment deals with chronic absenteeism. We know students cant learn if they are not in school. When I was a prosecutor in Hennepin County. I developed a major truancy initiative to keep kids in school and out of the courtroom. My office worked closely with local schools on a faster. more effective response to truancy problems. That is why my provision in the Every Child Achieves Acts will provide professional development and training to schools to help ensure that teachers. principals. and other school leaders have the knowledge and skills necessary to address issues related to chronic absenteeism. Truancy is sometimes called the kindergarten of crime because it is truly an early risk factor. I still remember looking at the files of serious juvenile offendersones who committed homicide and the likeand I realized the first indication that there was a real problem was truancy. It doesnt just hit in high school. it actually usually hits in sixth and seventh grade. The more we can do to put a focus on this. the better off we will be not only for public safety but. of course. for the kids lives. I again thank Senator MURRAY and Senator ALEXANDER for their tremendous work on this bill.
1140053490,"Mr. President. I rise today to express my concern and disgust at recent revelations of improper and dishonest conduct by senior executives at the Department of Veterans Affairs. including the director of the St. Paul office of the Veterans Benefits Administration. According to a report released by the VAs Office of the Inspector General this week. two Veterans Benefits Administration executives used their positions to assign themselves to different jobs that involved fewer responsibilities while maintaining their high salaries. One of them has been the director of the VBA St. Paul regional office since October of 2014. The inspector general found that the St. Paul VBA director used her influence as director of the VBA Eastern Area Office to compel the relocation of the previous St. Paul office director. She then proceeded to submit her own name for consideration to fill the vacancy she herself had created. Taking on the job of directing the St. Paul regional office was actually a step down in responsibility for this administrator. In the inspector generals words. she ""went from being responsible for oversight of 16 [regional offices] to being responsible for only 1 [regional office]."" But she kept her previous senior executive service salary of $173.949 per year. She also received over $129.000 in relocation expenses. So look at this: She had a responsible job managing 16 regional offices. She created an opening by transferring the person under her. She took that opening and went from supervising 16 regional offices to supervising 1. Then she kept the same salary. going from 16 offices to 1 office. and then took $129.000 in relocation expenses. This is the kind of action that has created the breach of trust between our veterans and the departments that exist to serve their needs. There are so many people who have such good will who work at the Veterans Administration. including in Minnesota. and there are so many deserving veterans who deserve their help. But to make this truly work. we have to show that the people at the top are accountable. What this director did was not responsible. it was not a good use of taxpayer money. and it certainly was not fair to our veterans. This is a senior executive who is supposed to be focused on ensuring that veterans are being served the way they deserve and who instead used her position to push out one of her colleagues and get herself a plum assignment where she would have fewer responsibilities but at the same time keep the same salary. This conduct is unacceptable. It erodes the publics trust in the VA. It is commendable that the VA inspector general took action by referring these two cases to the U.S. attorney for possible criminal prosecution. The VA needs to do right by our veterans and our taxpayers by holding bad actors accountable and implementing reforms to prevent exploitation such as this from ever happening again. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140073030,"Mr. President. I rise today to honor U.S. Air Force Maj. Adrianna Vorderbruggen. who was tragically killed in the line of duty 4 days before Christmas when a Taliban suicide bomber rammed his motorcycle carrying explosives into a joint NATOAfghan patrol near Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. She was the highest ranking military officer there who was killed. There were several others who tragically lost their lives as well. Today I had the honor of attending the majors funeral service at the Fort Myer Memorial Chapel. Senator FRANKEN was also there. She was laid to rest with full military honors at the Arlington National Cemetery. She is survived by her wife Heather. her son Jacob. her father Joseph. and her brothers. Dan. John. and Chris. I will note that three of the four members of the familysince I was just talking about adoptionwere. in fact. adopted. Adrianna was a native of my hometown of Plymouth. MN. where she attended my alma mater. Wayzata High School. She excelled in both academics and athletics and was a 3year starter on the Wayzata High School womens soccer team. This is a very large suburban high school. The year she was a starter and captain. she led the team to the State championship. She was also the captain of the Wayzata High School hockey team. She went on to the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado and graduated in 2002. In her senior year. she led the womens rugby team to the national championship title. She was their cocaptain. so you can imagine. She was a starter on the soccer team and helped lead that team in high school to a State championship. She was the captain of the hockey team. which is a big deal in Minnesota. of a big high school. and she was also the cocaptain of the rugby team and helped lead that team to a national championship title in the Air Force. We can imagine the leadership Adrianna had shown through her life. She always loved sportssomething that was talked about a lot today by her family. After graduating. she attended the Air Force Special Investigations Academy and was deployed to Iraq until 2005. In 2009 she was selected as an Air Force Institute of Technology student in forensic sciences and earned a masters degree in forensic sciences at George Washington University. In 2010 she became a special agent for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. which investigates felonylevel crimes committed by or against Air Force personnel in the United States and overseas. Major Vorderbruggen was also an outspoken opponent to the militarys former dont ask. dont tell policy. She and Heather. an Air Force veteran. were among the first servicemembers to marry after the policy was rescinded in 2010. Adrianna chose to serve her country in spite of the militarys policy and fought for reform rather than hiding her identity. As her older brother Chris said. ""She inspired us all. I think. by just being herself. and being proud to be who she was."" Adrianna was known by her family and friends for her positive attitude and her infectious smile. At the service this morning. her dad remembered Adriannas ability to remain upbeat even under challenging circumstances. And she loved their little boy. Jacob. who was there today with a loving family around him. Major Vorderbruggen will be remembered for the work she did in service to her country and the work she did to make sure all brave men and women in uniform receive the honor and the dignity they so rightfully deserve. I am proud to call Maj. Adrianna Vorderbruggen a daughter of Minnesota. She gave her life for a country she loves. Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140073037,"Mr. President. I am proud to rise in support of Justice Wilhelmina Wrights confirmation as a district court judge for the District of Minnesota. Justice Wright. as the members of the Judiciary Committee learned during her fine hearing. is a dedicated public servant with a distinguished career spanning the State and Federal legal system. She is the first person in the history of Minnesota to serve at all three levels of the judiciary and receive this nomination. She served as a district court judge in Minnesota. she served for the Minnesota Court of Appeals. and she now serves on the Minnesota Supreme Court. Her 15 years of judicial experience make her ready to do this job on day one. and I can state that when you hear the statistics about the overload for the District of Minnesota. we need her to start tomorrow on day one. Her qualifications are impeccable. Justice Wright has sat on panels deciding over 2.000 cases and presided over nearly 700. Yet with all those cases and all these opinions. there were no serious questions raised at all about her being biased or unfair in some way in her work as a judge. In fact. it was the opposite. She has the support of former Senator Norm Coleman. a Republican. and many others in our State who have served across the aisle. Her qualifications reveal a thoughtful and a talented jurist. one who applies the law to the facts of each case. Justice Wright currently serves as associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. a position she has had since her appointment in 2012. As the first AfricanAmerican woman to serve on the court. Justice Wright has earned the respect of litigants. lawyers. and judicial colleagues alike. Justice Wright was born in Norfolk. VA. She graduated from Yale College cum laude in 1986 and received her law degree from Harvard Law School in 1989. After law school. Justice Wright clerked for Judge Damon Keith of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. She then went into private practice for 5 years at Hogan & Hartson. Before long she felt the pull of public service. She joined the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota and has been a dependable and dedicated leader of the Minnesota legal system ever since that time. During her time as a Federal prosecutor. she received the U.S. Department of Justice Directors Award and the Departments Special Achievement Award. If you look at her path before she became a judge. every step of the way she excelled. She excelled growing up. She excelled in college and law school in terms of her record. She excelled as a judicial clerk. she excelled in private practice. and she excelled in the U.S. attorneys office. where she received numerous awards. She was then appointed by. I believe. Gov. Jesse Ventura. She did not start her career as a political appointee. He was in the Independent Party. She served as a Ramsey County district court judge from 2000 to 2002. when she was appointed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. She served for 10 years until her most recent appointment to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Justice Wright is also involved in a variety of civic and bar activities. She devotes 50 hours per year to educating the public on the law. If that is not enough. Justice Wright has also worked to improve the legal system. She has been a member of the Minnesota Judicial Council. the Minnesota Courts Public Trust and Confidence Working Group. and the Minnesota State Bar Association Task Force on the Minnesota Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct. In 2006. the Minnesota Women Lawyers honored her with the Myra Bradwell Award for her service. and in 2012 the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers presented her with the Presidents Award. The law has always been more than a profession for Justice Wright. It has been central to her own development. Growing up. she watched her parents fight the Norfolk. VA. school system to ensure her access to the same educational opportunities as everyone else. The protections enforced by the legal system were crucial to her familys struggle. As Justice Wright has said about the Supreme Courts decision in Brown v. Board of Education: ""Aside from the Bible. that court order was the most important written document in my familys life."" The law worked for Justice Wright. In turn. she has dedicated her own life to the law and to fairness and impartiality. Justice Wright deserves to be confirmed. As I said. the Judiciary Committee hearing went extremely well. She has the support of many members of the committee. In fact. her nomination went through without an objection when we had the vote. She explained any questions that the members of the Judiciary Committee hadand there were some. obviously. A very good Senator asked a lot of questions on the committee. She explained any question they had about past legal writings from law school and other issues. They felt secure in her nomination and passed her out of committee without any objection. No new issues have been raised since that time. There were no serious questions about the 2.300 cases she handled. I cant think of many nominees we have had with that kind of record. I would add that this nomination is particularly important to the District of Minnesota. The U.S. Judicial Conference has deemed the current vacancy in our State to be a judicial emergency. Our district caseload has increased significantly in recent years. In 2014. the district saw a 57percent jump in case filings. with nearly 6.000 Federal cases currently pending. Judge Davis assumed senior status last August. vacating the position for which she has been nominated. Failing to fill this judicial vacancy is failing the people of Minnesota. I am so proud of my colleagues and thank them for their support. both Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who will be voting for her today. Justice Wright is the type of nominee we strive forthe best candidate for the job. We had a bipartisan committee led by two private practice lawyers. one having served as U.S. attorney for the State of Minnesota under the first President Bush and the second President Bush. Tom Heffelfinger. He chaired this committee which looked at so many qualified nominees and made this recommendation to Senator FRANKEN and myself. So this process from the beginning has been completely bipartisan and impeccable and we are proud of that process. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Justice Wright as ""well qualified"" to serve as a district court judge for the District of Minnesota. which is the highest rating the committee awards. It is based on a confidential peer review of Justice Wrights professional competence. integrity. and judicial temperament. As Senator Coleman. a former Senator from the State of Minnesota. a Republican Senator. said: ""I fully support her nomination and have communicated that to my former colleagues."" Why does Senator Coleman support this nomination? Because he looked at the record of a woman of integrity. a woman who had not one case questioned before the very thorough Judiciary Committee. who has the support of many of the Republican Senatorsno objections raised when the vote was taken. This is exactly the kind of nominee we want. Justice Wilhelmina Wright will make a fine Federal district court judge for the District of Minnesota. I urge all my colleagues to support this superb nominee. The people of Minnesota need and deserve a judge of Wilhelmina Wrights caliber. We are proud of our Federal judges in Minnesota. Some came from Democratic administrations. some came out of Republican administrations. but they have always had the reputation of integrity. Justice Wright will continue to uphold that reputation of integrity. I ask my colleagues to support her. Thank you. Mr. President. and I yield the floor. I also see that my colleague Senator FRANKEN is here as well."
1140073472,"Mr. President. I rise to honor the outgoing Canadian Ambassador to the United States. Gary Doer. Soon Ambassador Doer will return home to Manitoba. but. lucky for us. he will be a frequent visitor to Washington. DC. as the new cochair of the Wilson Centers Canada Institute Advisory Board. We are glad the Ambassador will continue to be an influential voice in shaping U.S.-Canada relations. Over the last 6 years. I have had the privilege of getting to know the Ambassador. I knew we would get along well when I learned he was a longtime fan of Bud Grant. an incredible athlete who became the head coach of the Minnesota Vikings. From a Canadian perspective. he first coached the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. Bud Grant is adored in Minnesota and is still adored many years after he left coaching. In fact. it was during a recent playoff game that we remember wellin Minnesota versus the Seahawkswhere Bud Grant came out in 17belowzero weather and flipped the coin with no jacket on. What I will also never forget is attending an event at the Ambassadors home. I walked in the door. and he had a framed photo of Coach Grant right next to a framed photo of the Prime Minister of Canada. We like that in Minnesota. The Ambassador served for 6 yearsor doubleovertime. as he likes to call it. This is longer than his two predecessors combined. Ambassador Doers long tenure and the fact that he served Prime Ministers from different political parties are testaments to his professionalism and character. Ambassador Doer is also well known in Washington for his humor and good nature. and I am sure that helps. Minnesota shares a long border with Canadain fact. about 547 miles. As I like to say. I can see Canada from my porch. That must be why early on in my Senate career Leader REID asked me to head up the CanadaUnited States InterParliamentary Group. along with Senator MIKE CRAPO Of Idaho. Together we have come to understand what an important geopolitical partner Canada is to the United States. I am a Minnesotan who is proud to share a border with Canada. I appreciate the countrys friendship. culture. and beauty. Not only is Canada Americas biggest trading partner. but it is the only country with an embassy that at one point draped a sign that said ""friends. neighbours. partners. allies."" I will never forget how gracious Ambassador Doer was for hosting my swearingin celebration at the Canadian Embassy in 2013. 1 am the only Senator in recent history to choose the Canadian Embassy as a site for my Senate reelection swearingin party. and a lot of that had to do with the Ambassador. President Kennedy said this to the Canadian Parliament in 1961: Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. During his tenure in Washington. Ambassador Doer has been a strong champion for Canada and Canadians and an effective diplomat who gets things done. Through his successful 10 years as Premier of Manitoba and his efforts as Ambassador to engage leaders and citizens across the United States. the Ambassador has strengthened the already robust friendship and partnership between our two great nations. His list of accomplishments is impressive. He has worked tirelessly on tourism and trade while ensuring the safety and security of the border between our two countries. The Ambassador championed the agreement on the new bridge that will link Detroit and Windsor. This bridge is destined to become the most important border crossing between our two countries. For too long there has been complete gridlock on the bridge linking our countries. I know how hard the Ambassador has worked on the Windsor bridge. and for a while it looked as though it wouldnt get done. But the Ambassador never stopped fighting for it and refused to be satisfied until the deal was done. often using an old Gordie Howe saying that ""you dont put your hands in the air until the puck is in the net."" That is a hockey analogy between Minnesota and Canada. The Ambassador made sure the puck was in the net. The Ambassador was also instrumental in the U.S.-Canada preclearance agreement. a new agreement that will facilitate travel. create jobs. and encourage economic growth in both countries. while ensuring a secure border. This initiative reaffirms the commitment of the United States and Canada to enhancing security. while facilitating economic activity. and will help move more than $2 billion in goods and services and an estimated 300.000 people across the longest border in the world. I know that the Ambassador considers it an accomplishment that he helped to eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic redtape. making it easier for businesses and agencies to operate by working to align regulatory systems and practices in health. safety. and the environment. The Ambassador also strengthened Canadas role as a world leader in renewable energy when he worked to harmonize vehicle emission standards between our two countries. which will ultimately improve air quality on both sides of the border. In addition. the Ambassador fought for the Environmental Protection Agency Clean Power Plan. which provides Canadian hydroelectricity as a renewable energy that U.S. States can import and use to comply with new Federal emission rules. Ambassador Doer ensured that the surviving members of the World War II joint AmericanCanadian First Special Service Force. nicknamed the ""Devils Brigade."" received the Congressional Medal of Honor for its part in ending World War II. Like all friends. sometimes our nations have differences. but with his experience. tact. and plainspoken pragmatism. Ambassador Gary Doer has ensured that these differences are bridged so that our two governments can move forward together. In a 1943 address. President Roosevelt said this to the Canadian Parliament: Your course and mine have run so closely and affectionately during these many long years that this meeting adds another link to that chain. I have always felt at home in Canada. and you. I think. have always felt at home in the United States. Ambassador Doer. your service has added another strong and important link in the chain that connects our two countries. And as you have said many times in the past in Gordie Howe hockey terms. it is only safe to put your hands in the air after the puck is in the net. Ambassador. you have put a lot of pucks in the net. and now you deserve a moment to put your hands in the air to celebrate your work. In hockey parlance. you have scored for your great country of Canada. I am proud to have worked with the Ambassador during his time in the United States. and I hope he will always feel at home in our country. I yield the floor."
1140111844,"Mr. President. I wish to take just a few minutes to give a brief tribute to someone I know well. Patty Wetterling. and to her family. They are longtime Minnesota residents. Patty and I know each other well. We actually ran against each other for the Senate in 2005. and out of that experience we came to be very good friends. Patty Wetterling is a woman of unbelievable courage. Her son Jacob was kidnapped at gunpoint 27 years ago. All that time she has kept the hope alive that he would be found. She knew it was a small hope. but. as we know. there have been cases in America where missing children are found 10 years. 20 years later. and that is what she was hoping for. This past week. those dreams were dashed. as a very evil man came forward to law enforcementhe was already in captivityand admitted to this crime and brought law enforcement to Jacobs remains. The story. which I will not put on the record. is a horrific one. but I think the most poignant moment in this horrible story were Jacobs last words. which were: What did I do wrong? This little boy did nothing wrong. He was an 11yearold riding his bicycle in his town. in a very rural part of Stearns County. MN. where things are supposed to be safe. Well. they werent safe that day. The amazing part of this story is not only the memory of this little boy. but it is how for years Patty Wetterling and her family have turned their grief into action. Understandably. many people try to hang tight to their family. She has done that. She has been a great mom. but she went beyond that. She served on the board of directors of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. She has been a nationally recognized educator on child abduction and the sexual exploitation of children. She and her husband cofounded the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center to educate communities about child safety issues and to prevent child exploitation and abduction. She served for more than 7 years as director of the Sexual Violence Prevention Program for the Minnesota Department of Health. She was named one of the ""100 Most Influential Minnesotans of the Century"" by one of our newspapers. She has kept this hope alive. but what is amazing about it is. she has saved other lives. A number of bills. legislationincluding the sexual predator registrationhave come out of the work. better collaboration between local and Federal law enforcement. She has saved so many lives in Jacobs memory. Senator FRANKEN and I are going to be putting a resolution on the record today on this topic. but I just wanted to take a moment personally to recognize Patty for her strength. her courage. and her grace. I yield the floor. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum."

1130001219,"Mr. Speaker. in a remote region of Algeria at an oil and gas facility. in the dark of night before the sun rose. workers from all over the world were getting ready to sit down for breakfast when suddenly gunwielding Islamic radicals stormed the facility. Some of the workers were killed. some were able to escape. some were taken hostage. One of the hostages killed in this attack was a member of my congressional district. Victor Lovelady. Victor was a native of southeast Texas. He was originally from Nederland. Texas. a town of primarily hardworking. blue collar folks centered around the energy industry. Victor had recently moved to Atascocita. Texas. his home not far from where I live. He was 57 years of age. When he died. he was on a contract assignment for ENGlobal. an energy company in Algeria. According to his family. Victor waited to take that contract until his children had finished school so he could attend their sporting events. This was not surprising for someone who was described as a ""dedicated family man and a fantastic coworker."" Although it was hard to be so far away from his family. Victor was excited to take the contract assignment so he could ensure a secure future for his family. Thats just the kind of father and husband he was. The deal for this contract was 28 days on. 28 days off. and he was just 10 days in with only 18 days left to go. He was scheduled to come home to Texas the day after his daughters birthday. His life was stolen by those who seek to destroy Americans. the radicals who inflict terror on all who believe in freedom. Victor is survived by a loving family. including his wife. Maureen. daughter. Erin. and their son. Grant. Over the holidays. the close Lovelady family expressed concern for the safety of Victor. but he reassured them saying. ""Its so safe. We have protection."" Its hard for people to understand such unspeakable evil. I spoke with Victors brother. Mike. throughout the crisis and as did Congressman RANDY WEBER. Yesterday. after we heard the terrible news. Mike told me: I can associate with my brother getting in a car wreck or having cancer. But terrorism and Nederland. Texas. dont go together. He was described as ""a great family man and a fantastic coworker"" and ""a leader who mentored countless individuals during his tenure."" He was also known for his spontaneous wit. Victor moved from Nederland. Texas. to Atascocita to be closer to work. but he went back and forth so that his children could finish school there. Mr. Speaker. Victor was killed not just because of what he did. he was killed because of who he was. He was killed because he was an American. A radical Islamic al Qaeda group by the name of the Signatories in Blood claimed responsibility for this terrorist attack. those who seek to destroy us and kill indiscriminately. They hate us for who we are and what we stand for. Diplomacy is not in their vocabulary. Two other Americans were also killed in this attack. Their names were Gordon Lee Rowan of Sumpter. Oregon. and Frederick Buttaccio of Katy. Texas. The Algerian military retook the compound after 3 days. and they found that 34 other hostages had been killed. as well as dozens of terrorists. Mr. Speaker. our thoughts. prayers. and concerns are with the Lovelady. Rowan. and Buttaccio families today. Secretary Panetta said that America must respond to these murders. That is correct. We should go after these killers who have malice and evil in their hearts. that kill Americans because they are Americans. That would be justice. and justice is what we do in this country. And thats just the way it is."
1130021265,"Mr. Speaker. early last year. I spoke with businesswoman Catherine Engelbrecht. also founder of True the Vote and King Street Patriots in Houston. Texas. True the Vote is a nonpartisan organization whose purpose is to train poll workers to uphold voter integrity at the polls. because. despite what many say. voter fraud is rampant in America. King Street Patriots is a group of libertyminded. patriotic individuals in Houston who meet weekly to discuss whats going on here in Washington. Catherine told me that both of these groups and her family had not only been harassed by liberal progressive groups but also by the Federal Government. It all began when Catherine applied for nonprofit status in 2010 for True the Vote and King Street Patriots. So began the tidal wave of government inquiries and harassment. In a recent interview. Catherine said this: We applied for nonprofit status in 2010. Since that time. the IRS has run us through a gauntlet of analysts and hundreds of questions over and over and over again. Theyve requested to see each and every tweet Ive ever tweeted and each and every Facebook post Ive ever posted. Theyve asked to know every place Ive ever spoken since our inception. and to whom. and everywhere I intend to speak in the future. We have learned that the IRS has even asked these groups. Mr. Speaker. for donor lists. Mr. Speaker. this level of detail goes well beyond the business of the IRS. and it didnt stop there. The Federal Governments snooping included six visits by the FBI. as well as multiple unannounced visits from OSHA and. yes. even the ATF. Mr. Speaker. you may remember the ATF. Those are the ones responsible for smuggling guns into Mexico. How ironic it is they want to audit American citizens but lose track of guns where they were purposely sent to the drug cartels. In any event. in addition to True the Vote. Catherine and her husband were also personally audited. Keep in mind Catherine and her husband have owned a small family business for 20 years and have never been audited by the IRS until all of this. Why now? It seems very coincidental. I asked that question when I submitted a FOIA request on behalf of True the Vote and King Street Patriots to FBI. OSHA and the ATF asking if they were under criminal investigation. The reply from these agencies was that none of these individuals were under criminal investigation. Well. if theyre not. why are they being treated like criminals? Just because they question government. Mr. Speaker. Catherine is not alone. The IRS has admitted to systematically targeting certain groups who have opposing views from the administration. According to USA Today. between February 2010 and May 2012. only one Tea Party group was granted taxexempt status from the IRS. But during that same 2year period. the IRS has approved dozens of liberal and progressive groups for their taxexempt status. Coincidence? Yeah. right. Not only does this behavior of the IRS threaten individual freedom and violate the Constitution. I think it may be criminal. It is unlawful for any Federal agency to use its law enforcement and its investigation power as a means to harass and target certain individuals whose political views differ from any administration. It would appear that such actions are also in violation of Federal law and the equal protection and due process protections guaranteed in the Constitution. Private citizens should not be punished for questioning government. This is America. not a Third World dictatorship or the Soviet Union. This type of government oppression and political opposition is disturbing. Ive written Attorney General Eric Holder to request him to direct the U.S. Office of Special Counsel to investigate any potential violation of the Hatch Act that may have occurred by IRS employees. Ive also asked Attorney General Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate all of this. No government should be requiring citizens to furnish their schedules. donor lists. personal communications or political beliefs to any government agency. No government agencywhether its the IRS. the FBI. the ATF. or OSHAshould be used as a tool to suppress those who are considered ""opposition groups"" and dare to question our government. The IRS is abusing its power to tax by harassing and punishing those who have been ""taxed enough already."" And thats just the way it is."
1130038691,Mr. Speaker. it was September 1972. People from all over the world were gathered in Munich. Germany. for the Olympic Games. After World War II. there was a feeling of optimism and unity. But overnight. those feelings turned to turmoil and turned to terror. The world awoke to images of a deadly terrorist attack in the Olympic Village. A terrorist group called Black September took 11 Israeli hostages and massacred them. In response. the Israeli Government did not hesitate. The Israeli policy was: you will not murder Israelis anywhere in the world. So for 20 years. Israel hunted down the killers all over the globe. from Paris to London to Beirut to Stockholm. With its response. one thing became clear to the terrorists: if they hurt Israelis. there would be consequences. and the consequences would not be pleasant. Israel would find them. and Israel did find them. So flashforward 40 years. On the llth anniversary of 9111. there were once again attacks on American sovereign soil. In Egypt. militants stormed the U.S. Embassy. In Libya. our Ambassador. Chris Stevens. and three other Americans were brutally murdered. There has been no accountability or action from this administration regarding these crimes. All Americans have received are grainy surveillance photos and some empty promises. Where is the justice for these families of these four victims? The identities of some of the attackers are known. Why have we failed to go get them? When America has been tested by terrorists in the past. we have gone after them. just like Israel has done. In 1996. 19 American soldiers were murdered in Saudi Arabia. The United States responded. In 2001. when 3.000 people from all over the world were murdered here in the United States. we responded. President Bush said: The search is under way for those who are behind these evil acts. Ive directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and bring them to justice. Is that our U.S. policy today? Well. we dont know. We dont know what the current U.S. policy is about Americans killed overseas. All we get is a lot of words with no results from the administration. Our enemies continue to test us because they no longer fear us. Mr. Speaker. The world no longer knows where America stands on terrorist attacksnot our allies. not our enemies. and not American citizens. So what is our policy when a U.S. Embassy is attacked? More broadly speaking. what is our foreign policy in north Africa? North Africa is a breeding ground for terrorism. and al Qaeda affiliates are being trained and expanding across the entire African continent. Earlier this year. on January 16. al Qaedalinked terrorists affiliated with Mokhtar Belmokhtar took 800 people hostage at a gas facility in Algeria. One of those hostages killed was Victor Lovelady. a neighbor of mine in Atascocita. Texas. Victors brother. Mike Lovelady. testified in front of our Terrorism Subcommittee last week. His family deserves answers from this administration about what happened in Algeria when Americans were killed. Who are these terrorists in Benghazi? Who are these terrorists in Algeria? Have these ringleaders gotten away with these murders? Is the massive intelligence service of the United States of America not capable of finding these people throughout the world? Maybe the intelligence service ought to spend a little less time snooping around in the private lives of Americans and go after terrorists overseas. but thats a different issue. The Loveladys deserve justice. They lost a father. a brother. and a husband. These attacks in North Africa prove that Osama bin Laden may be dead but that terrorism is still alive and well. If terrorists do not know the consequences of their actions. they will not fear any consequences. That is the world in which we live. Its time. maybe. that we articulate a policy and mean it. If you attack Americans. America will come after you. Come hell or high water. were going to track you down somewhere in the world. The Libyan and Algerian killers must meet the same fate as the members of the Black September group. So. Mr. Speaker. when you talk to the President. tell the President to track these people down. Let them know they cannot run. they cannot hide. they cannot disappear into the darkness of their evil waysbecause justice is what we must have. Justice is what we do in this country. And thats just the way it is.
1130040079,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. My amendment cuts aid to Pakistan in this bill in half. This is the same amendment that passed this House last year by voice vote. Pakistan seems to be the Benedict Arnold nation in the list of countries that we call allies. They have proven to be deceptive. deceitful. and a danger to the United States. The day Osama bin Laden met his maker will go down in history as an important moment. Our manhunt did not end in a remote cave in the mountains. but in a palace in a bustling military town 35 miles from Islamabad. To think that the most senior levels of the Pakistani Government did not know he was there requires. as Secretary Clinton has said. the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" Soon after. our suspicions were confirmed. Instead of celebrating with us the capture of the number one terrorist in the world. Pakistan arrested the one person that helped the United States capture Osama bin Laden. And last year. Pakistan sentenced Dr. Afridi to 33 years in prison. In February of 2012. a NATO report said ISIwhich is Pakistans CIAis aiding the Taliban and other extremist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan by providing resources. sanctuary. and training. In June of 2011. Pakistan tipped off terrorists making IEDs not once. but twice. after we told them where the bombmaking factories were and asked Pakistan to go after them. But they did not. They told the terrorists that we were coming. Throughout 2011. Pakistan tried to cheat the United States by filing bogus reimbursement claims for allegedly going after militants when they werent even doing that. On September 22. 2011. Admiral Mike Mullen. the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that: With ISI support. Haqqani operatives planned and conducted that truck bomb attack. as well as the assault on our Embassy. The truck bombing he mentions here wounded more than 70 Americans and NATO troops. who were injured because of that bombing. Admiral Mullen went on to say that this terrorist network acts as the arm of Pakistans InterServices Intelligence Agency. It doesnt seem to me that Pakistan deserves any more of our money. Weve been doing the same thing for the last 10 years. Since 2002. Pakistan has collected a total of $26 billion of American money. And what have we gotten in return? Treachery. Its time for a new strategy with Pakistan. There are some who say we need to pay Pakistan to help with our withdrawal. All their shutting down of the southern route showed was that we dont need Pakistan. We were able to pursue our mission even though they shut down that route. What really endangers our troops is not whether or not we have a southern supply route but whether or not we have access to Pakistans tribal areas. Of course that has been off limits. according to the Pakistan Government. This bill gives Pakistan over $1 billion. Cutting funding in half hopefully will send a messagelong overdueto the Pakistanis that they cant play us anymore. that we mean business. To add a few more comments. Mr. Chairman. a poll conducted in Pakistan showed that 64 percent of the Pakistanis consider the United States the enemy. and yet we are paying them $1 billion a year? Doesnt make any sense to me. Plus. Americans who have an unfavorable view of Pakistan is 81 percent. So why do we pay Pakistan to be our enemy? Why do we pay them to hate us? Mr. Chairman. I submit they will do both of those things for free. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130042259,I wish to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Texas . Houston is the fourth most populous city in the country. but unlike other large cities. we have struggled to have an effective mass transit system. Ten years ago. Houston had only buses. Wider highways were always the solution for transportation. Over the past decade. Houston has but one light rail that averages 36.000 weekly boardings. I have never been a strong champion of light rail. but my congressional district includes a significant portion of the proposed rail line in section 166. the University rail line. which would go from downtown Houston toward the Hillcroft Transit Center. A majority of my constituents in the affected area that would be served support the light rail. I am concerned about section 166 of the bill that would prohibit Federal funds from going toward a part of the University line that falls in the neighboring 7th Congressional District. Mr. CULBERSONs district. This language. although affecting his district primarily. indirectly affects my constituents because it has the effect of killing the whole project. Federal funds are needed to build the University line in Houston. To be clear. section 166 really doesnt save any Federal money. It just sends those funds somewhere elsemaybe to New York City. If were going to spend the money. lets keep the money in Texas and put Texans to work. Ive recently surveyed the constituents who live in the affected area in my congressional district. My office went doortodoor meeting with local businesses over the last few days. speaking with organizations and talking to constituents. Those in the affected area want light rail. On Facebook alone in the last 2 days. 604 people supported light rail and 340 opposed it. One Houstonian commented: Houston needs a viable eastwest transit corridor to connect to the Main Street line. As a 23yearold young Houstonian. I strongly support the Richmond rail and project for Houstons future. At least 26 community and civic organizations support the University line. At this time I will yield to the gentleman sponsoring section 166 in the bill. Mr. CULBERSON. for a colloquy.
1130064132,"Mr. Speaker. the innovativeness of American enterprise flies off the radar. According to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. the company is fixing to deliver packages to its customers via drones. It is called ""Amazon Prime Air."" Thats right. In just a few years. Bezos said people will be able to order something online and have it in their hands within 30 minutes by the use of drones. It sounds like something out of the Jetsons. doesnt it? Gone will be the days of the neighborhood mail carriers. Soon there will be a drone to replace them. According to Amazon. these drones can deliver packages up to 5 pounds. which makes up 90 percent of their deliveries. Mr. Speaker. thousands of Americans use Amazon every year. especially around the holiday season. Amazon. unlike the glitchridden government Web sites. can efficiently use online Internet services that get a timely product to market. Think of how many drones could soon be flying around the sky. Here a drone. there a drone. everywhere a drone in the United States. Mr. Speaker. Amazon is just one of many companies that will be looking to take advantage of this costeffective drone technology in the coming years. And good for Amazon. I congratulate them. The FAA is charged with the responsibility of coming up with ways to regulate drones for safety reasons. but who is watching out for the privacy of American citizens? Congress has the responsibility and the duty to set clear regulation for all drones in domestic use. Absent legislation to prevent surveillance of Americans. companies could use drones not only for delivery. but other ways that. in my opinion. violate the constitutional right of privacy. The issue of concern. Mr. Speaker. is surveillance. not the delivery of packages. That includes surveillance of someones backyard. snooping around with a drone. checking out a persons patio to see if that individual needs new patio furniture from the company. Photographing swing sets. pools. or the people that are in the pools. or even looking into windows. all of that could be done with the use of drones under corporate America or by individuals. This would all be possible. So Congress must ensure that the expanded use of drones in the coming years does not come at the expense of the individual right to privacy. After all. this is a right guaranteed to all Americans under the Fourth Amendment. Thats why I have. along with Representative ZOE LOFGREN (Calif). introduced the bipartisan Preserving American Privacy Act. Our bill would deal with several things. and. once again. Mr. Speaker. were talking about regulating surveillance and setting guidelines for the expectation of privacy for citizens. It would. first of all. deal with the government. It would prohibit the government from using drones for targeted surveillance of an individual or their property without a search warrant. The Fourth Amendment applies to the use of drones when the government is involved. It would also prohibit individuals or companies from using drones to take photographs or audio recordings of private individuals without their consent. This is private surveillance. or spying. or snooping. whatever you want to call it. It would restrict private individuals and law enforcement agencies from arming drones. which can be done. As we enter this uncharted world of drone technology. Congress must be proactive and establish boundaries for drone use that safeguard the constitutional rights of Americans and not leave this up to the FAA. Individuals are somewhat concerned that these new eyes in the skies may threaten their privacy. so Congress can and should immediately balance this hightech development with our constitutional right of privacy. Boundaries are needed before drones flood the skies of America. Just because Big Brother or individuals or companies can look into someones backyard or through a window of a house doesnt mean it should be allowed. As the innovativeness of American enterprise flies off the radar. we should be mindful that technology may change. but the Constitution does not. And thats just the way it is."
1130065730,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. all around Israel things are in tremendous turmoil. To Israels south. Egypt is experiencing its worst period of unrest in 50 years. There is no elected government. and there wont be until next year. The economy is on a ventilator in Egypt. It is propped up only by billions of dollars of aid from Gulf countries. The Muslim Brotherhood is openly fighting the interim government with armed mobs. Terrorists and vagabonds in the always lawless Sinai Peninsula are only encouraged by the weakened state of Cairo. To Israels north. Syria has become the worlds hotspot for terrorists. Terrorists like al Qaeda and Hezbollah are streaming in. with no end in sight. Outoftown criminals have come into the country to wreak havoc. To Israels east. already fragile Jordan is being overrun with Syrian refugees and infiltrated by terrorists as well. A little further east. al Qaeda is wreaking havoc in Iraq. There is more violence there than at any point since And to the far east. mischief regime of the desert. Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon that can enable it to fulfill its threat to wipe Israel off the map. When I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu 2 weeks ago. he was clear that Israel cannot accept Iran as a nuclear threshold power if Israel wants to continue to exist as a people. He called our interim deal with Iran the worst deal of the century. I agree with him. It seems that we not only gave away the farm. we gave away the mineral rights as well. We took our best diplomatic tool. sanctions. off the table. The biggest problem with the deal was that it made a peaceful solution more unlikely. With all of these threats surrounding it. we need to stand side by side and let the world knowour enemies and our friendsthat we are allies of Israel. They are the U.S.s strongest ally. Israel is the only democracy in the region and the only one that respects human rights. It is in their national security interest and our national security interest to ensure Israel can defend itself from the everchanging military threats. The enemies they have in the neighborhood are enemies to us as well. I support H.R. 1992. The bill will make sure. too. that Israels enemies do not gain a military advantage over the State of Israel. I urge its passage. And thats just the way it is.
1130092753,Madam Speaker. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for yielding me this time and also for his support and work on this legislation. and I thank the ranking member as well. Also. I want to thank my friend across the aisle. CAROLYN MALONEY from New York. for being the chief cosponsor of this legislation on the Democrat side. Madam Speaker. Cheryl Briggs is one of many American children that got caught in the slave trade. When she was 12 years of age. she ran away from home because she was being assaulted by her father. Not long after that. she was picked up as a hitchhiker by a trucker. and then soon after that. she was put in the slave trade where she was forced to have sex with men several times a day. She also was forced to work at a strip club during the daytime. sold at night. and also was forced to do that work in the daytime. She was able to escape that trafficker because a patron at one of the clubs figured out she was a mere child and called the police. Sex trafficking of minor children happens all over the world. It happens in America. Recently. I was in South America. I went to a shelter in Peru. and I met several girls. One of them was named Lilly. At 10 years of ageshe was 10she was sold by her mother for a cell phone to a sex trafficker. Lilly gave me this bracelet when I was there. and she asked me to remember her and the other girls that were at the rescue shelter. Madam Speaker. as the chairman and the ranking member pointed out. in the United States. there is not much help for minor sex traffic victims. There are approximately 300 bedsor lessin the whole country for children victims of sex trafficking. Compare that to animal shelters. We have over 3.000 animal shelters. America needs to do better. and this bill will help America do better. so we can proclaim not only to the traffickers and the buyers of sex slaves that the victims of crime. the children. just arent for sale. They are not for sale here in America or anywhere because they are children. Childrenthe greatest resource any nation has are our children. no matter whether they are runaways. throwaways. or stowaways. they are not for sale. This legislation enforces the law against the trafficker. the slave trader that buys and sells these children. It makes sure that they go to the penitentiary. and the law is very clear. On the other end. it treats these victims of crime as victims of crime. They are not criminals. They are not child prostitutes. There is no such thing as a child prostitute. Children cannot consent to sex. They are rape victims. Society and the law are going to start treating them that way. rescuing them and giving resources to children assessment centers. to the police to recognize these children that have been captured and stolentheir youth stolen and they are in the slave trade. Most importantly. this bill goes after the demand. those people in this country who buy these children for sex. The days of boys being boys are going to be over in this country because those people in the middlethey are not johns. they are child rapists. They are going to be held accountable for their actions against these girls. The law is clear. It is clear that the law will prosecute those individuals. They will go to the same penitentiaries as the traffickers for stealing the soul of the youth of Americas greatest resource. our children. I am glad to see that this bill has so much bipartisan support that it came out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously. It is one of several bills that are coming to the House floor today to proclaim to the country and to victims of crime and to criminals that the days of the slave trade are going to end in the United States. And thats just the way it is.
1130124257,"Mr. Speaker. the United States has our military all over the world. and we have for a good number of years. In fact. the United States has been at war for a long. long time. This year. as we approach Christmas. families across America will gather around to enjoy homemade apple pie and turkey and each others company. but our men and women in uniform. those volunteers. are still all over the world. protecting and representing the United States. These are Americas best. It is the best we have in our country. In 2005. I had the opportunity to go over to Iraq and see our military during the Christmas season. But before I left. I decided I would ask local schoolchildren and their teachers to help make some homemade Christmas cards and holiday cards to give to our troops when I arrived in Iraq. So that year. after I landed. I took about 5.000 handmade Christmas cardsmade primarily by schoolchildrento our servicemen and -women in Iraq and also in Kosovo. Since that time. children in southeast Texas have been making handmade Christmas cards and holiday cards for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and other parts of the world every year. and these cards are either taken overseas by me or they are shipped. This year. the community in southeast Texas and the schools rallied. and the result is quite outstanding. I am proud to say that this holiday season we will be sending 96.000 handmade Christmas cards and holiday cards to our troops in Afghanistan. Iraq. and other parts of the world. primarily made by schoolkids in southeast Texas. Remember. Mr. Speaker. these are handmade cards. These are not storebought cards. These cards were received from various Texas residents. Just to name a few: Kingwood High School. Sterling Middle School. Timberwood Middle School. Goose Creek Memorial High School. Alamo Elementary. Horace Mann Junior High. the Hi Neighbor Club in Kingwood. Houston Methodist Hospital. Baytown Chamber of Commerce. the Baytown school district. the Baytown Housing Authority. Victory Hospital. and Boy Scout and Girl Scout clubs in southeast Texas. Mr. Speaker. 80.000 of these came from the city of Baytown alone. So a big ""thank you"" to Rikki Wheeler. the executive vice president of the Baytown Chamber of Commerce. as well as to the Baytown schools. hospitals. and organizations for their remarkable contribution and organizing and managing the collection of these cards. The patriotic spirit of those folks in southeast Texas to me is quite heartwarming. and the outpouring of support from Texans. primarily schoolchildren. is quite exceptional. I want to thank all of those who have taken the time to bring joy to our troops in lands that are far. far away. those troops who will be separated from their families this Christmas. It is because of the schools. the teachers. and the schoolchildren that this is all made possible every year. This is a way that people in southeast Texas show appreciation to our troops who are separated from their families this time of the year. Remembering to thank them and send them special greetings is very important. Many of these schoolchildren have family members overseas who are serving in the military. and this small gesture brings comfort and cheer to all of those involved. A piece of home will mean so much to those who are representing us overseas. and it is possible only because the community volunteers to do this each year. The simple act of making a handmade card shows the connection between our warriors and our schoolchildren who are thinking about them this time of year. So this Christmas. as Americans celebrate. we remember to say a prayer for those who safeguard Americas freedoms. We thank our volunteers in uniform. and we thank our volunteers who made this season quite special for our military by making these cards. And that is just the way it is. Mr. Speaker. at this point. I will also include for the RECORD a list of other groups who have made holiday cards for our troops.

1140009533,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the chairman for his leadership in the area of tax reform and entitlement reform. Ladies and gentlemen. this is not monkey business. This is serious business. kind of d6ja vu all over again. We have now been at trying to do comprehensive tax reform for 5 years. and we should continue to try to do it. but our constituents shouldnt be held hostage for the lack of the ability for us to get it across the finish line. This is bipartisan. Let me remind my friend from Michigan that the provisions in these bills that I am sponsoring today were part of a package that was being negotiated to be made permanent by a bicameral. bipartisan group of legislators in December. Democrat leadership and Republican leadership. before the President stepped in and said ""no."" He said ""no"" to constituents of mine like Claggett & Sons. a general contractor. I will tell you what the controller of Claggett & Sons said about section 179. This is what he said: It is an important part of our decisionmaking process when evaluating equipment purchases. He went on to say that making the increased expensing levels permanent. as this bill does. will be beneficial for capital purchases planning for small businesses. Let me tell you. when you look at section 179 in particular. Mr. Speaker. we had section 179 at this level. supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. for 2014. On December 11. 2014. we gave our constituents 20 days to take advantage of this provision. as we have done now 12 times on a temporary basis since 2003. Claggett & Sons couldnt take advantage of it. My friends have heard about my constituents. farmers Tom and Judy Priee. about buying a eombine. waiting to see when we would make this permanent or reextend it. We gave them 20 days to make that decision 20 days. That is no way to run a railroad. none at all. Mr. Speaker. I understand the points that the other side has made. I want tax reform in a comprehensive way as bad as anybody. The two arent mutually exclusive here in terms of. we can do this. give our small business owners and farmers the type of certainty they need that will help our economy grow. that will help their businesses grow. rather than do what we have done for 12 years now over 12 years making these temporary provisions. extending them for a year or two at the end of the year. That is just no way to do this. So. ladies and gentlemen. on behalf of small business owners like Claggett & Sons and farmers like Tom and Judy Price. I urge us to move the ball forward. We can chew gum and walk at the same time. We can do this. and we can move on to try to find common ground on comprehensive tax reform. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140009568,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time. Ladies and gentlemen. this isnt a game. This is reality. This is Groundhogs Day. We have been doing this for 12 years. You go ask somebody who is trying to run a business in America on Main Streetthey want certainty. they dont want retroactivity. Heck. we got 10 months left in the year. They would like longer than that. Their business cycle is longer than 10 months. Their business cycle is years. Go ask an accountant at a business in terms of how they have to plan. The rules are rigged against them. The rules the chairman talked about the rules. I am going to underline and bold this. Imagine this: this provision is expired. and my colleagues in the minority are concerned about adding to the deficit because this provision that expired on December 31. we are trying to renew without raising taxes on other people. When spending expires. the chairman mentioned a few of those programs. and we renew them at the same level. it doesnt add to the deficit. Think about that. Go talk to some constituents at a diner on Main Street in any of our districts and see if they think those rules are fair. They are paying the bill. They are paying all of the bill. Ladies and gentlemen. we have got to get things done. We have to get things done. The American people are counting on us to get things done. This is as common ground as there is in our Tax Code when it comes to trying to help job creators create jobs. I dont know anybody who wants a minimum wage job. I know people who want jobs that pay more than the minimum wage. I had a minimum wage job once. I wanted to make more than that. That wasnt my goal. My goal was to make more money than minimum wage. Each and every one of us knows somebody who cant find a job who wants a job. I know people who want to create more jobs and have their businesses grow. This provision. ladies and gentlemen. we know this provision helps people get jobs. It doesnt have to be that hard. We can walk and chew gum. Mr. Speaker. we can lay the groundwork for comprehensive tax reform. but we need partners. We need partners in the Senate. and we need partners in the White House. The White House has said they are for C corp reform. Well. as everybody knows. this provision is going to help a lot more than just C corps. It is going to help small businesses that are passthrough entities. S corps. limited liability companies. and momandpop small businesses on Main Street. We cannot wait. These people have waited long enough. Ladies and gentlemen. we need longterm certainty. This is an important step to comprehensive tax reform a very important one that we need to pass and get on our business to getting to comprehensive tax reform. So I would plead with my friends in the minority. lets put aside this rhetoric. lets move toward this. lets pass this bill. We had a debate last summer that is reminiscent of debate today. and we almost got there. ladies and gentlemen. Democrats in the Senate. the Democrat majority leader. our chairman at the time. Dave Camp. were negotiating the framework of what some now are being critical of that would create permanency for policy provisions that we are debating today. We know Democrats are for this. under the right circumstances. exactly how this is written. So lets put aside all those things. and lets do work today that is good for America and good for Americans. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140013982,Thank you. Mr. Chairman. for your support of H.R. 284. the Medicare Competitive Bidding Improvement Act which. as you said. I introduced with my friend and colleague from Connecticut. Mr. JOHN LARSON. The bill does fix a fundamental flaw in the Medicare durable medical equipment Competitive Bidding Program by simply requiring that bids be binding. It will promote fairer competition. More importantly. it protects our seniors and supports small businesses. DME includes items like home oxygen. blood sugar monitors. and walkers for seniors. The Competitive Bidding Program was intended to reduce outofpocket costs for these seniors. However. over the last several years. it has become very clear. Mr. Speaker. that the bidding process is extremely flawed. in large part because the bids are not binding. This encourages lowball biddingor suicide biddingwhich artificially drives down prices and will eventually lead to market failure because there is no performance on many of these bids. meaning seniors dont get their equipment. I have heard from seniors. beneficiaries. and small business suppliers in my State of Ohio that the program is impeding access to needed items for seniors. like the ones I just described. ultimately harming their health and making costs more expensive for our seniors and the program itself. This is absolutely unacceptable. The goal of the bill is to reduce the number of bad actors who are now participating in the program by simply imposing a penalty if the supplier who wins the bid doesnt accept the contract to the bid they won. The bill will help ensure that these suppliers submit bids in good faith. creating more certainty for those suppliers. and. most importantly. making sure that seniors get the supplies and the equipment that they need and qualify for. increasing access to more quality products and services at the end of the process. If this bill is signed into law. seniors across the country will no longer have to worry about whether the company in their area will provide the information and. more importantly. the equipment to which they bid on and actually be able to provide that wheelchair. walker. or oxygen tank that that senior so desperately needs. As the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee mentioned. the bill has bipartisan support. It is a commonsense bill that actually passed the Ways and Means Committee unanimously. It was scored by the Congressional Budget Office to actually save taxpayer dollars over the next 10 years. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill. and I thank Mr. LARSON for his partnership.
1140035152,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman and thank him for his leadership. credible leadership. on this debate. about American leadership. quite frankly. Ladies and gentlemen. we are here to debate three bills today: trade assistance for displaced workers. trade promotional and accountability authority that inserts Congress into the Presidents ability under the Constitution to negotiate a trade agreement with anybody he or she wants. and then finally customs and enforcement. Enforcement is critical. ladies and gentlemen. It is a bill I am so thrilled and honored to have had the opportunity to introduce here in the House. This is a key bill as part of trade. Far too long. we havent had as good of enforcement. quite frankly. as we need to have. and I am committed to that. Now. let me just mention one thingtrade deficits. trade surpluses. We have 20 countries that we have agreements with. trade agreements with. 20 of them. Two of them happen to be on our borders. Mexico and Canada. You take out energy that we import from themand I would rather import it from them than anywhere else in the worldwe have a trade surplus with those 20 countries. a surplus in manufacturing. My dad was in manufacturing. I already told you beforeand Mr. LEVIN has heard this 1.000 times. I think. he is probably tired of hearing itmy dad lost his job of 25 years. and I lost my health care as a kid in the household. along with my sisters. long before NAFTA. Globalization began occurring. as Dr. BOUSTANY said. after World War II. We can either engage or disengage. When we disengage. we lose. When America engages. we win. We can outwork anybody. What trade agreements do actually is break down barriers so we can compete. and then we have to have the enforcement piece. Ladies and gentlemen. that is what this is about. It is about breaking down barriers. My State of Ohio has been devastated by globalization. My dads job before NAFTA was devastated by globalization. Fortyeight countries in Asia have had trade agreements with each other. For the last 10 years. we are party to two. The world is passing us by. We are being left behind. We can compete if we break down barriers. That is what we need to do today. Trade assistanceinsert Congress into the Presidents ability to negotiate because he already has that ability. This doesnt change that. This inserts us. This inserts slow track. With that agreement. whatever that agreement is. in Asia. in Europe. 60 days in public before the President can sign it. 60 days. I wish I had 6 hours6 hoursto review the Affordable Care Act before I had to vote on it. This is 60 days where Members will have an ability to look at what was negotiated. If we dont like it. we will vote it down. We have the constitutional authority to do that. This is about jobs. Vote all three bills ""yes."""
1140038498,Mr. Speaker. this is a good day for America. As the previous speaker just said. globalization occurs with or without America engaging in the world. It is important for America to engage in the world. to write the rules of the global balance economy. but whether or not we do or we dont. there will be winners and losers because of globalization. This bill is called the preferences bill. but it is more than just about preferences. It is about Americas leadership in Africa. It is about Americas leadership in Haiti. It is about Americas leadership at home in providing trade assistance for those workers who did lose their job because of globalization. My dad was one of them. Long before America engaged in a bilateral trade agreement. my dad lost his job as a steelworker. There are important provisions in this bill written by Chairman RYAN that will help the steel industry. That is really important. My dad was in that industry. He lost his job of 25 years. He benefited from trade assistance. This is important for American workers. This is also important for those workers who lost their job through no fault of their own and who lost their health care. The health coverage tax credit is renewed in this bill. This bill almost wasnt. quite frankly. There was a lot of rhetoric on the floor of this House and the floor of the other House about the word of our chairman and the word of our Speaker and about how this wouldnt come up and we cant trust them. Well. let me tell you. ladies and gentlemen. our chairmans word has been gold from day one in this process. Every commitment he has made has come through. Through this process. every commitment our Speaker has made has come to be. We wouldnt be on the floor today debating this bill and approving this bill in a little while if it werent for the leadership of Chairman RYAN and the leadership of Speaker BOEHNER. They both deserve our thanks. Also. the chairman has put together a great staff at the Ways and Means Committee. They should be thanked for their yeomans work in this process. which has been very difficult but very bipartisan and very bicameral. Americans want this place to work. Americans want Congress to work together for Americas benefit. Americas leadership in the world today is a little bit stronger. The light of America is shining a little bit brighter because of the work that this Congress has done on this bill and the other bills. including the customs bill that this Congress has put together and will be sending to the Presidents desk shortly. America is going to lead in the global economy because of what we have done today. Americans should be proud that Congress is working again.
1140058637,"Mr. Speaker. what a journey. What a journey. It is a journey that I got to join after I was elected to the House in November of 2000. My first real interaction with you. Mr. Speaker. you might remember. you were the incoming chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. As freshmen. we were putting together our requests to decide what our top committee assignments would be. Education and the Workforce wasnt one of mine. but apparently it is one of yours. not just for you as chairman but for me as freshman because you came by and you saw my list and said. ""I dont know why you are doing that. You are going to be on the Education and the Workforce Committee."" I said. ""No. I am not."" Yes. I was and. yes. I did. And it was an unbelievable experience. It was one which I did not expect. And as Chairman RANGEL said. it was one that made history with George Miller and the late Senator Ted Kennedy and President George W. Bush. It wouldnt have happened without the leadership of thenChairman BOEHNER. Boy. could he run a committee. It was really his forte. and most Americans dont even know what a great committee chairman he was. He was a committee chairmans chairman. quite frankly. He. as leader. as Speaker. will go down in history as one who cherished that process. That process was not always what he liked or what he wanted. but he sure understood it. he sure respected it. and he sure loved it. As Mr. RANGEL knows. he was sure good at it in a bipartisan way. In early 2006. we had an opening for majority leader. I harken back to a dinner that I was able to attend back in 2002 when I heard thenChairman BOEHNER say. ""You know. some day I would like to be back in leadership."" I looked at him like he was crazy. You are kidding me? How could he do that? Do you know what he did? He just worked hard. He did the right things. He played the long game. He helped people. When the opening that nobody saw came in 2006. he won an upset race on the second ballot to become our majority leader. The die was already cast. and we lost that election in November of 2006. The Democrats took the majority. and JOHN was our minority leader. He worked hard. Many thought that we would never see that majority again. On November. the day before the election in 2010. I had lunch with thenLeader BOEHNER. and he said: ""We are going to take the majority back. and it is going to happen tomorrow."" Ladies and gentlemen. history all changed when Pope Francis came. It changed because Pope Francis was here. but it changed the history of JOHN BOEHNERS speakership. I am confident history will show that JOHN BOEHNER was one of the best Speakers in the history of our country. Mr. Speaker. Godspeed. We will miss you."
1140068388,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. today I rise in support of H.R. 3831. the Securing Fairness in Regulatory Timing Act of 2015. This is a small but really important piece of legislation. I am pleased to have the gentleman from California . my friend. here to discuss this important measure. The House passed this measure earlier this year. in June. by unanimous consent. Now. we return to the bill to add the technical corrections asked for by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Senate so we can send this bill to the Presidents desk before the end of the year. Today. the Medicare Advantage program. known by many as the MA program. serves more than 16 million seniors across the United States of America. including my mom and dad. Enrollment has increased more than threefold in the past 10 years and is expected to nearly double in the next 10 years. To ensure that seniors in MA plans across the country are able to continue to receive the highquality care that they deserve. CMS is expected to pay about $156 billion to more than 3.600 MA plans this year alone. That amounts to nearly 30 percent of overall Medicare spending. Typically. every year CMS sends out what it calls a rate notice to plans and Medicare Advantage companies that details the various payment rates. as well as benefit changes that the agency intends to make for the following plan year that impacts people like my mom and dad. This notice follows the standard process of a draft notice. It gets published. then the public has a certain amount of time to submit comments and questions. and then the agency publishes a final notice based on that feedback that they receive. However. MA and Part D arent treated the same as the other major payment systems within Medicare itself. Right now. the current process takes about 45 days. but only 15 of those days are allotted for the commenting portion. 15 days for thousands of plans. millions of stakeholders to submit comments on proposed changes to a program that amounts to onethird of all Medicare spending. I could almost understand this if the rate notice were a short and concise document. if it were easy to understand and simple to implement. But it is not. In fact. the rate notice has grown from around 16 pages in 2006 to nearly 150 pages this year. That is over a 900 percent increase. All the while. the time for the public comment period has remained static. exactly the same. This means less and less time for the plans and Congress to conduct the necessary review in order to provide CMS with the kind of feedback that would better help the agency assess the impact of their proposed changes to consumers. This is important because without accurate feedback. CMS could inadvertently move forward with a proposed change to the Medicare Advantage program that might negatively impact those seniorsagain. like my mom and dadwho depend on these plans for access to their providers. to their doctors. The legislation before us is simple. and it is straightforward. It extends the public notice period from 45 days to 60 days. Therefore. it would double the extension of the comment period from 15 days to 30 days. This is a commonsense. goodgovernment fix we can make that will give plans more time to understand the changes that CMS proposes and other constructive feedback in order to make the Medicare Advantage program. overall. more responsive to senior citizens needs. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this legislation again and send it to the Senate so we can get it to the Presidents desk. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140068865,I thank the chairman for all his leadership on this going back years. Mr. Speaker. I introduced the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act in April of this year. and it is great to see that this issue is finally getting done. I would really like to thank Speaker RYAN and. again. Chairman BRADY. Chairman REICHERT. a special thanks to Representative BOUSTANY for his leadership going way back as well. and JASON SMITH. the Congressman from Missouri. for his incredible work to get this bill in a better place. I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Senate who helped make this a successful conference committee. This bill presents a long. long overdue opportunity. I would ask my colleagues to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. In my home State of Ohio. one in five workers jobs. Mr. Speaker. depends on trade. Trade drives our economy. In fact. exports from Ohio last year hit an alltime high. This bill will make it even easier for Ohio companies to trade and will increase exports. and that means increasing jobs in my State of Ohio. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Act plays a pivotal role in helping ensure that our trade agreements. our preference programs. and our U.S. trade laws are enforced and that legitimate trade is done. Over the years. the volume and the complexity of trade and the challenges. such as combating evasion of duties and protecting U.S. intellectual property rights. have grown. and grow more complex. Meanwhile. we are facing increased competition around the world. and it is critical to keep the flow of trade moving efficiently. Customs issues are vital to our competitiveness. security. and safety. Streamlining legitimate trade and providing benefits to trusted traders will increase U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace. This bill would reduce barriers and burdens to our small and medium businesses that drive our economy. saving them time and money. and. again. create jobs. Another major pillar of this bill is strengthening enforcement of our trade remedy laws. Enforcing U.S. intellectual property rights. antidumping. and countervailing duty laws prevents our competitors from gaining an edge by cheating. When our competitors around the world dont play by the rules. we get hurt. our American businesses get hurt. and our American workers pay. When our American companies and American workers compete on a level playing field. they win. we win. This bill makes our trade remedies more effective by allowing our Customs agencies to take quick action against these bad actors. giving our businesses a fair opportunity to compete and win. This bill also contains a commitment to advancing a Miscellaneous Tariff Bill process. I strongly support that commitment. and will continue to work to find a path forward. Mr. Speaker. MTBs provide important relief to our manufacturers who import materials that have no domestic content or supply. The tariffs they payor the taxes. they are taxeson these products make the entire manufacturing supply chain and the process more expensive to my constituents. The MTB process must be resolved in a way that is not only consistent with our House rules. but also our constitutional responsibilities.
1140097342,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today I rise in support of H.R. 5273. the Helping Hospitals Improve Patient Care Act. or ""HIPC"" Act. This bill truly represents a bipartisan effort. and I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Washington State for working with me on this bill. The bill also fully represents what the Speaker has often called true regular order. Prior to introducing H.R. 5273. the Ways and Means Committee held three hearings on topics included in the bill during the 114th Congress. and the committee recently marked up the bill in a unanimous way. H.R. 5273 strikes the right balance of preserving siteneutral payment policy. which I support. and providing essential relief for hospitals that were caught up in this policy change from last years budget deal. Specifically. this bill helps many hospitals around the country and in my State of Ohio. including a facility by OhioHealth and Nationwide Childrens Hospital that was started a year ago. last summer. and will benefit from full outpatient payments under the bill. as they had planned to when they dug the hole for their facility. Further. the James Cancer Hospital. part of my alma mater at Ohio State University. will have their cancer designation protected under the bill. along with other designated cancer centers. The bill also touches on three very important themes in the Medicare program: One. giving providers regulatory relief. two. ensuring access in rural areas. and three. protecting Medicare beneficiaries access to that important service that people like my mom and dad count on. Under the topic of regulatory relief. we have included three Ways and Means member priorities: Representative DIANE BLACKS bill that provides physicians who primarily practice medicine in ambulatory surgical centers relief in the electronic health records program. Representative VERN BUCHANANS bill. ensuring full access to Medicare advantage plans. and finally. Representative MIKE KELLYS bill requiring fair and transparent reporting by congressional district on the enrollment of beneficiaries in both the traditional feeforservice Medicare and Medicare Advantage programs. All of these priorities have previously passed the House during the 114th Session. Under the topic of access in rural areas. the bill allows for continuation and expansion of participation in the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program. Championed by my colleagues. Senator GRASSLEY in the Senate and Chairman DON YOUNG in the House. this policy is a continuation from the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Under the topic of beneficiary access in Medicare. the bill requires the Secretary to revise the preMedicare eligibility notification. adding greater transparency for beneficiaries. which was led by my colleagues. Dr. MCDERMOTT and Representative PAT MEEHAN. Finally. the bill includes two important Member priorities that advance important Medicare hospital issues. The first requires the Secretary to ensure there is proper adjustment for socioeconomic factors. The gentleman from Ohio has championed this issue for some time. Representative JIM RENACCIS policy ensures that the hospital readmissions program provides an applestoapples comparison based on the specific patient population a hospital treats. The second priority. led by our Speaker. PAUL RYAN. is the establishment of a crosswalk of hospital codes. Back when Speaker RYAN was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. he actively pursued Medicare hospital issues. His crosswalk is an important building block of a future system that promises to streamline the operation of hospital services. I encourage my colleagues to pass this legislation. send it to the Senate. and lets get this to the Presidents desk. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."

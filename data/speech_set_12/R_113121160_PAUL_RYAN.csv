1130010589,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I also want to thank my friend from Maryland for a lively debate. He and I have done this so much we can probably finish each others sentences. Washington is arrogant. There is an arrogance here in the Federal Government. Its an arrogance that says we know how to run things better in Washington. we should run everything here. We reject that. We believe in the principle of federalism. which is contained in our Constitution. We think that people who are closer to the problems can probably do a better job of fixing problems. I have a letter from the Governor of Utah. a letter from the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Iowa: This budget will replace the rigid. onesizefitsall Federal programs and instead offers the States the flexibility they need to make these programs work for the people they serve. This budget gives States maximum flexibility in areas like Medicaid. food stamps. TANF so States can determine the optimal way to provide services to these unique populations. We want to empower people closer to the problem to help solve these problems because you know what? Were not fixing these problems. The other measure of arrogance in Washington is only in Washington is reducing the increase of spending a huge cut. Only in Washington is growing spending for the Federal Government at 3.4 percent a year instead of 5 percent a year a massive cut. You know what? Governments growing just fine. The Senate Democrat budget says lets grow spending at 4.7 percent a year instead of 5. Thats supposed to be progress. The family budget is growing at less than 2.5 percent for the next 10 years. Thats the best projection weve got. the most generous one. If the family budget is only growing 2.5 percent and the Federal Government is growing about 5 percent. this is imbalance. This is arrogance. We should ask our Federal Government to do just what our families do and balance the budget. Thats the responsible thing to do. Now. lets take a look at what our friends on the other side of the aisle are doing. The one consistent theme of all of these budgets that are being offered by Mr. VAN HOLLEN. by the other Democrats. by the Senate Democrats is tax more and spend more. The Senate Democrat budget. that comes in the cheapest one of them all. Increase net spendingremember. we have a trilliondollar deficit. a debt crisis in the future. What do they say? Lets net increase spending above where we are and lets raise taxes $923 billion. The House Democratic budget. lets have a net spending increase of $476 billion and lets raise taxes $1.2 trillion. The Congressional Black Caucus budget: lets raise spending $1.99 trillion and have a tax increase of $2.9 trillion. Or the Progressive Caucus budgetthat one really takes the cakelets have a $4.65 trillion spending increase only to be slightly outdone by a $5.683 trillion tax increase. This is what theyre saying: ignore the deficit. ignore the economy. all the answers lie in Washington. take more from hardworking small businesses. take more from families. spend it in Washington. and. oh. by the way. we dont have a crisis. Thats just scaremongering. Do you know what? Try telling that to our children and our grandchildren who are guaranteed to get a lower standard of living if we dont fix this mess. Try telling that to the struggling workers. the families. the people in poverty in America today who arent cutting it in this economy. Balancing the budget helps us promote a healthier economy to create jobs and get people back on their feet again. and thats exactly why were proposing and passing this budget. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130037315,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Chairman LUCAS and Ranking Member PETERSON for their work on this bill. There are some good ideas in here. and we should act on them. Now. I still have serious concerns with this bill. But Im hopeful that a conference agreement will address these concerns. Heres what this bill gets right: In some areas. it cuts wasteful spending. It eliminates direct payments. And it consolidates duplicative programs. I want to commend the chairman and the members of the Agriculture Committee for proposing these reforms. These reforms dont go far enough. but Im hopeful that a conference agreement will limit cropinsurance subsidies to small farmers. We should impose a limitation on the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) for those receiving cropinsurance subsidies. and I have been given assurances that the House will be able to speak on this issue. I will consider supporting a conference agreement only if it includes an AGI limitation or equivalent reforms. I will say theres been noticeable improvement in this bill: First. it encourages real reform to our commodity programs. In the past. agricultural interests used the threat of skyrocketing costs under ""permanent law"" to push status quo farm bills through Congress. By eliminating this arbitrary threat. we can continue to reform these programs under a more deliberative process. Second. this bill considers farm programs on their own merits. For far too long. Congress has considered agricultural programs and nutrition programs in conjunction. Both of these programs need to be reformed. and we should evaluate each of them separatelyand on their own merits. I continue to believe we should have a safety net for our farmers. We should help the little guythe family farm thats in need. We need these AGI limitations to maintain a safety net for small farmers and to ensure that large agribusinesses do not continue to receive taxpayer support. I want to commend Chairman LUCAS for bringing good ideas to the table. I continue to have concerns about this bill. but am hopeful that a conference agreement can improve it. And if a conference agreement does not improve it. I will vote no on that agreement. I will support the passage of this billand will look forward to seeing the changes made in a conference agreement."
1130055429,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all. I would like to thank Chairman LUCAS for his work on passing a farm bill through the House. It was not an easy task. And the farm bill got a lot right. in my judgment. It eliminated direct payments. It made reforms to the food stamp program. which are in desperate need of reform. It consolidated duplicative programs. and the Agriculture Committee has started to implement very needed reforms of these programs. Unfortunately. I dont think it went far enough. which is why I am offering this sense of the House. I think that we should accept what the Senate didand they did it in a bipartisan fashionto impose limits on premium subsidies going toward the wealthiest of farmers. What this sense of the House does is it simply says. lets agree to the CoburnDurbin amendment which said. for those making above $750.000. the sense of the Congress is that their premiums for crop insurance should not be as generous as everybody elses. In fact. their premiums should be subsidized by 15 percentage points. This is hardly draconian. In fact. I would support going much farther than this. as I have voted consistently in the past. But what this says is. if you are a farmer and you make more than $750.000. all you will get is a crop insurance subsidy that is not as generous as everybody elses. It will be 15 percentage points less. Let me give you an example. If you have protection for 50 percent of your yield. right now the Federal Government will subsidize 67 percent of that. Under this. if you make over $750.000. you would be subsidized by 52 percent of your crop insurance. Hardly draconian. So what we are simply saying is. we had a vote that was 5933 in the Senate to limit the subsidy for crop insurance for very wealthy farmers. That is 1 percent of all of our agricultural producers in the country. and what we should do is concede to that. We should agree with that in conference. and that is what the sense of this House resolution encourages. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.

1130085542,Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. and I want to thank Mr. WOODALL for all of his hard work on this issue. as well as Mr. GOHMERT. who was here a moment ago. for raising this issue. for keeping focus and attention on it. and for bringing this muchneeded reform through the House Budget Committee and to the House floor. This bill basically fixes a real quirk in our budget process. Under the current law. the Congressional Budget Office assumes every discretionary spending account gets an increase every year to keep up with inflation. What does that mean? This means that this increase is built into the baseline. and the baseline is our starting point of spending. It is our starting point of budgeting. So every year. Congress moves the line forward. It assumes that there is always going to be an increase in every one of these programs. regardless of the facts on the ground. There is no consideration to whether a program is working or not or even whether it is still necessary. Under this bill. the baseline would just show the previous years funding level. That is basically what we are saying. If we are spending X amount of dollars today. when we write next years budget. we will start with X. and then we will make a decision here in Congress: Should it be more or less or the same? That is not how it works today. We spend X today. then there is an automatic increase. and then we decide how to budget after that automatic increase. We should write the Federal budget just like families write their own budgets. They dont get an automatic increase. They dont get to decide like that. We have got record deficits. We have got an unprecedented debt. Our job here in Congress is to make decisions. It is to set priorities. It is to look at the hardworking taxpayers that are working so hard to pay their taxes. to raise their families. and tell them we are going to watch their money more closely than just assuming automatically each and every year we can just take more from them and then decide how to spend more on top of that. It is no way to run a budget. It is no way to run a government budget or a family budget or a business budget. So that is all we are saying. This. I think. is an inflated baseline which is a smokeandmirror move. What we are saying is take away the smoke and the mirrors. start from scratch. and then make informed decisions from there. That is why I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia for all of his hard work on this. That is why I encourage all Members on both sides of the aisle to support this muchneeded reform.
1130086070,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 5 minutes. Well. here we are. Mr. Chairman. resuming the debate we left off yesterday. Let me try and give a summary of what this is all about. This is all about getting our fiscal house in order. This is all about prioritizing hardworking taxpayer dollars. This is all about doing in our generation what we need to do to make sure that the next generation has a secure future and a debtfree future. So that is why we are bringing a budget to the floor. that is why we are making those difficult decisions. and that is why we are advocating for these important reforms. In much of the 20th century. a lot of programs were created. and a lot of laudable goals were established. But now in the 21st century. I think we have learned a thing or two about how we can better accomplish and achieve some of these goals such as health and retirement security. because the way these programs were designed nearly a generation ago. they are now going into bankruptcy in this generation. If we allow that to happen. then we will pull out from underneath those who depend on these programs for their health and retirement security. we will renege on that social contract. More to the point. we are going to do damage to our economy if we keep this deficit and debt going on its current course. We asked the Congressional Budget Office to take a look at the kind of deficit and debt reduction that we are proposing and tell us over the long period. over the course of this budget. what does that do for America and for our economy? And they tell us that getting your economic and fiscal house in order. reducing the deficit and balancing the budget so that you can begin paying off the debt is good for economic growth. In fact. it will increase economic output by 1.8 percentage points. That is actually a lot. What does that mean to every person in America? About $1.100 in more takehome pay and in higher income because we did our jobs here. But. more importantly. what it means for the next generation is. instead of sending our bills to them to work hard. to pay their taxes to pay off our bills and then they have to start working for themselves. we are going to give them a better future. Because we know right nowthe CBO tells us as muchthey are going to inherit a diminished future. That is point number one. Point number two is that we have got to stop spending money we dont have. We will hear all of these arguments about the draconian cuts and the slashing and all of this. These are the same arguments we have heard time and again. And when those arguments have prevailed. they have brought us to where we are today: extraordinarily high deficits. deficits going back to $1 trillion by the end of this budget period. and a debt that is about to take off. If we dont get this under control. then we will not have the kind of economy that the people of this country deserve. We dont want Washington to stand in the way of peoples success. We want Washington to play its rightful supporting role so that people can become successful. We believe in a system of natural rights and equality of opportunity so people can make the most of their lives. We dont believe in a system where government thinks that they must take this commanding role within the middle of peoples lives that ends up bankrupting this country. diminishing the future. and lowering economic growth and prosperity. There is a big difference in approaches. We want to tackle these challenges. What I also want to say is that we have an important obligation to secure this country and protect our national defense. America. like it or not. is the superpower nation in the world and a duty that falls upon us to take that responsibility seriously. With that responsibility also comes the ability to chart our own course in the world. to help preserve the peace. and to help pave the way for prosperity so that we can have economic opportunity and so that we can advance our views and our values and the protection of individual and human rights and democracy. These things are good for America. A strong America and a strong military helps make for a peaceful America and a prosperous America. So we need to take the needed reforms to make sure that these critical retirement programs are there. not only intact for people in and near retirement. but there for those of us who are younger when we hope to retire. We need to get our spending under control so we can balance our budget and pay off our debt. We need to enact progrowth economic reform like tax reform and economic development to create jobs today.
1130086140,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself the balance of my time. Let me try and translate for the viewer what is happening here. Every time you hear the word ""invest."" that means take from hardworking taxpayers and spend in Washington. and then when that is not enough. ""invest"" means borrownearly half of which is from other countriesfrom the next generation and spend in Washington. Just so you know. when they keep saying invest. invest. invest. or you are not investing enough. disinvest. it means tax. borrow. and spend here in Washington. as if we know better how people should spend their money. The analysis we hear about jobs lost and how this isnt going to work and it is going to cost all these jobs is the same analysis that said the stimulus was going to be a boon. It is the same analysis they said that if we just borrow and spend $780 billion in Washington on shovelready jobs. unemployment will never reach 10 percent and we will create millions of new jobs. It didnt work. It all comes down to this. Rather than prioritize our spending. rather than holding the Federal Government accountable and more transparent to make sure that taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely and prudently. rather than balancing the budget and paying off debts so the next generation has a debtfree inheritance. rather than taking on the bloated Tax Code that is mired with special interest giveaways and tax breaks and loopholes. rather than opening up this incredible store of oil and gas that could give us a huge renaissance of more jobs and lower gas and home heating prices and a better foreign policy. rather than preserving our military and giving our troops what they need. rather than growing our economy and creating what is estimated by the CBO to give each person an average of $1.100 more in takehome pay because of that faster economic growth. rather than doing any of that. just do more of the same. Stick with the status quo. That is what this rhetoric is. It is a straw man argument. It is basically an argument that says lets affix certain views to our opponents so that we can defeat these awful views that we say they have and win the debate by default so that we can stick with the status quo and keep doing more of the same. Mr. Chairman. here is where we are headed. This debt. this red line is the status quo. This is where America is going. It is not a Republican or a Democrat thing. It is a math thing. What we are saying with this budget is. the status quo isnt working. We cant do more of the same because we are headed in the wrong direction. Everybody in this country knows this. This is our plan. It is actually a plan. Pay off the debt. grow jobs. and challenge the status quo. And that is why I urge adoption of this budget."
1130086741,"I yield myself the balance of the time. Let me first start off by saying. Mr. Chairman. you have presided over this budget for many years. You have set a great example for the rest of us. This is your last year serving. and I want to thank you for what you have done for this institution. Thank you for setting a great example. Mr. Chairman. what this debate comes down to is a question of trust. We have offered a budget because we trust the American people. Unlike the Senate Democrats who. once again. have punted. have chosen not even to offer a budget this year. we trust the people to make an honest assessment. We trust them to make the right choice for their future. Now. to their credit. the House Democrats have offered budgets as well. The problem is they put their trust in Washington. Every time you hear this word ""investment."" just know what that means: take from hardworking taxpayers. borrow more money from our next generation. from other countries. and spend it in Washington. Time and again. they are proposing to put government in the drivers seat. They have already engineered a takeover of our entire health care sector. They are overregulating our energy sector. They are depriving us of jobs. They wont even give us the Keystone pipeline. They are proposing yet new taxes. another $1.8 trillion increase. They are proposing more cronyism. They are proposing more control for Washington. less control of our communities. less control over our businesses. less control over our lives. less control over our futures. In my respectful opinion. it is a vision that is both paternalistic. arrogant. and downright condescending. You know. Big Government. in theory. it sounds compelling. In practice. it is totally different. Remember. if you like your doctor. you can keep your doctor. Remember. if you like your health care plan. you can keep your health care plan. Remember. if government just takes over this sector. it will lower your costs. Big Government in practice is so different than in the theory. The results have nothing to do with the rhetoric. We. on the other hand. trust the people. We are offering a balanced budget that pays down the debt. We are offering patientcentered solutions. so patients are the nucleus of the health care system. not the government. We are offering a plan to save Medicare now and for future generations. We are offering a stronger safety net with State flexibility to help meet peoples needs and to help people get from welfare to work. to make the most of their lives. We are offering a progrowth Tax Code. We are offering more energy jobs. You can boil the differences down to one question: Who knows better. the people or Washington? We have made our choice with this budget. I trust the American people to make theirs. Mr. Chairman. lets call the votes."
1130120000,"Mr. Speaker. today. my colleagues and I will vote on the Federal Duck Stamp Act of 2014. This bill would raise the price of Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamps (more commonly known as ""Duck Stamps""). for the first time in 23 years. from $15 to $25. I am a proud supporter of this legislation and ask my colleagues to vote in favor. Ever since Congress created the Duck Stamp program in 1934. hunters have bought duck stamps to help pay for the protection of wildlife habitats. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the money generated from these sales to acquire new land or preserve existing wildlife refuges for water fowl. Duck Stamps also serve as an entrance pass for any national wildlife refuge that charges admission. so they are in effect a user fee for hunters and bird watchers. Today. because of rising land prices and inflation in general. the value of the Duck Stamp has fallen by 40 percent. depriving conservation efforts of crucial funds. As an avid hunter. I understand the importance of investing in our wildlife habitats. We need to pass these traditions on to the next generation. so they can learn the importance of being good stewards of the land. Since the federal government already owns nearly one third of our countrys land. this bill prohibits new land acquisition and requires the funds generated from the fee increase to be used solely for acquiring easements for migratory birds. But since the funds collected from Duck Stamp sales are technically classified as revenues. increasing the fees to allow for higher spending on protecting migratorybird habitats does not comply with the Houses ""Cut as You Go"" rule (Rule XXI. Clause 10). In the past. weve made exceptions for spending increases that are offset with revenue increases for selected programs when there is a close connection between the revenues and the spending. For example. budget resolutions often include reserve funds that effectively waive the ""Cut as You Go"" rule for deficitneutral legislation designed to achieve a specific purpose. Because the funds generated from this legislation will be user fees. not taxes. and this bill reduces the deficit. I support granting a waiver of the ""Cut as You Go"" rule for consideration of this bill."

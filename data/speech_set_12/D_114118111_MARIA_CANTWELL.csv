1140002505,"I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I know we are going to be going back and forth on this issue and that we have other people coming. Later this morning we are going to have time divided. But I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota allowing us to join in the debate this morning and make a few points. I do want to say I appreciate the hard work of the Senator from North Dakota on the energy committee in general. I look forward to working with him on many energy policies. He and I have worked together on a couple of different agricultural issues. I certainly appreciate his due diligence. but needless to say I do not agree with the process of moving forward with this motion to proceed to the Keystone XL Pipeline bill. Many of my colleagues are going to be coming down and talking about the issues. Two of my colleagues. including the Senators from Utah and Arkansas. along with the Senator from North Dakota. brought up a couple of different points. But in my mind. they are talking about a 19th century energy policy and fossil fuel instead of us focusing on what should be a 21st century energy policy for our country. It is unfortunate that S. 1 is a very narrow. specific. special interest measure for a pipeline that did not go through the proper channels of a permitting process and because of that is flawed. As people are heralding it as the new Congress. This process continues today with people saying: Lets just give it more special interest attention and approve it. I believe America should be a leader in energy policy and that our job creation is dependent upon that energy policy for the future. We want to see America be a leader in this. I applaud the fact that the President reached a climate and clean energy agreement with China. We are over 60 percent of the worlds energy consumption. If the two countries can work together on a clean energy strategy. I guarantee that will be good business for the U.S. economy. In fact. I read a statistic that something like 50 percent of all energy is going to be consumed by the buildings in Chinathere is huge growth in building development. but they do not have good building standards so those buildings consume too much energy. So there is a lot to do on energy efficiency that will grow U.S. jobs and help us. That is why we would rather see us focusing on some of the energy policies that we did in 2005 and 2007. Those things unleash huge opportunities for American jobs and huge opportunities for American consumers to get a better deal and not be subject to price spikes. The 2007 bill had fuel efficiency standards in it and laid the foundation for the growth of the hybrid electric car industry and has added over 263.000 jobs in the last 5 years. That is the kind of smart policy we should be pursuing. We also have had energy bills that made investments in clean energy tax credits. something I was just talking about with my colleague from Utah. saying we needed to move forward on energy tax credits. If there is nothing else that we should be doing. we should be doing that as S. 1. because the predictability and certainty we would be giving to that industry would certainly unleash many jobs. So the 2005 and 2007 energy bills that we did in a bipartisan fashion helped foster an energyefficient economy and helped support 450.000 jobs according to a 2011 Brookings Institution report. These are examples of the types of things we have done in the past that have unleashed investment. and have grown jobs in the United States of America. They are important milestones in the type of clarity Congress can give to the private sector to spur growth and development. I can guarantee this is the opposite of that. This is about a special interest deal and overriding a process. including the White House process and local government process. that is so essential. Two examples of what we should be doing instead: As I said. the energy tax credits which have been delayed. As my colleagues from Oregon pointed out at the end of last year. we basically authorized them for about 2 more weeks in December. That was about all the certainty we gave the industry. A McKinsey report has estimated that providing the right incentives for retrofitting buildings and energy efficiency would help employ 900.000 people over the next decade. that the wind energy tax credit would employ 54.000 people. and there are other issues about modernizing our grid and new technology storage. There is also very important work to be done in the manufacturing sector. that is. to help unleash innovation by making sure we set standards on improving efficiency and focusing on lightweight materials for both automobiles and aviation. We have seen huge job growth in the Pacific Northwest because we were able to transform aerospace into lighter weight materials. We are also working on a biojet fuel. So all of these things mean we have to get the R&D right. we have to get the tax credits right. and we need to help protect consumers from spiking energy prices. This is the evolution. I do not think anybody in America thinks we are going to hold on to a 19th century fossil fuel economy forever. The question is. Whether Congress is going to spend its time moving forward on a 21st century plan that gives the predictability and certainty to unleash that leadership and capture the opportunities in developing markets around the globe or whether we are going to hold on to the last elements of fossil fuel forever and leave our constituents more at risk. But I would like to take a few minutes and talk about this process my colleagues are trying to describe as to why we need to hurry. Because I can guarantee that is what people have been trying to do all along. hurry this along for a special interest. I do not believe that is good for the American people. I do not think it is good for this process. If we think about where we have been. this process is about people who are trying to push a route through no matter what the circumstances. Every State. people are saying. has approved this process. I can guarantee there are a lot of people in Nebraska and a lot of people in South Dakota who do not agree with that. They are very concerned about the public interest. Unfortunately. in the case of the Keystone XL project. landowners and ranchers in Nebraska affected by the pipeline did not feel they were afforded equal opportunity before the law. In their view the process was set up to benefit a special interest. the TransCanada Corporation. On three separate occasions. beginning in 2011. the Nebraska Legislature passed carveouts to circumvent the role of the public service commission to approve the Keystone Pipeline. If this was such a great deal. why cant it go through the normal process. as in every other State. with a transportation and utilities commission ruling on siting? Why do we have to take the public interest out of it? The first carveout included the Major Oil Pipeline Siting Act of 2011. So this bill laid out the rule that the public service commission determined whether a new pipeline project was in the public interest. In making this decision. the legislature required that the commission consider eight criteria. Among them: the environmental impact of water and wildlife and vegetation. the economic and social impact. the alternative route. the impact to future development in the pipelines proposal. and the views of counties and cities. OK. That all sounds great. right? That is what the legislature says they should be considering. But the legislature also required the commission to hold public hearings and have public commentOK. we are still on the right trackand importantly required the commission to establish a process for appealing the decision. so that any aggrieved party could have due process rights under the Administrative Procedures Act. Here is the punch line. Tucked away in that Nebraska legislation was a special interest carveout that exempted TransCanadaKeystone XLfrom having to comply with the public service commission process. Specifically. the legislation stated. ""... shall not apply to any major oil pipeline that has submitted an application to the US Department of State pursuant to Executive Order 13337 prior to the effective date of this act."" There was only one company that qualified for this special interest exemption at the time of that legislation. that was TransCanada. So you got it. The legislature basically exempted them from that process. even though they were stating that these are the processes that you should go through. So at the very time the legislature created new rules for due process on the pipeline. it exempted them from those rules. I do not understand why TransCanada cannot play by the rules. but I guarantee you Congress does not have to join in and make S. 1 a special interest bill. They should make sure everyone plays by the rules. In this same legislative session. the Nebraska legislature also passed the Oil Pipeline Route Certification Act. This bill provided Keystone XL with an expedited review process by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality and gave the sole authority to approve the project to the Governor. Unfortunately. for the legislature and for TransCanada. these carveouts quickly became irrelevant because President Obama denied the application in 2012. That is in part due to the fact that Congress had decided to try to intervene in the matter. That is when Congress said this is important and we should go ahead and do this. I am going to get into more detail on that in a second. This is important to understand because the initial Nebraska legislation was so narrowly tailored. it was designed to benefit the TransCanada pipeline and its pending date of enactment. What happened next? The legislature went back to the drawing board and created a third new special carveout for the Keystone XL Pipeline. The day following the Presidents denial of TransCanadas application. a new bill was introduced in the Nebraska Legislature. This bill was yet another path around the existing due process afforded to citizens in that State. The legislation allowed the company to choose whether to go through a formal process with the public service commission or seek expedited review with the Governor. I am sure a lot of U.S. companies would love to have that opportunity. These are U.S. companies that have to pay lawyers. go through environmental processes. make sure all of the issues are addressed. I am sure American companies would love to know any day of the week they can just go past a utility commission and get the Governor to stamp ""approved"" on their project. Under this expedited approach. the legislature authorized the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality to independently conduct an environmental impact report. However. unlike due process required by the public service commission. this process required only token outreach to the public. There was just one public hearing in 2012. This special process provided no recourse for aggrieved parties. There was no formal appeals process. Other than the courts. there was no administrative process with the ability for stakeholders to challenge the facts as a matter of record to base their formal appeal on. These are fundamental differences between an expedited consideration within the Governors office and a process requiring a public interest determination by relevant decisionmakers at a commission. I know my colleagues here would like to argue that somehow this has been a long. drawnout process. This has really been a process by one company constantly circumventing the rules on the books and trying to get a special deal for approval. We have to ask ourselves why. Why do they want to proceed this way? I know my colleagues always like to talk about their neighbors. My neighbors in British Columbia are not so thrilled about tar sands pipeline activity. They are not interested in it. So maybe that is why TransCanada wants to hurry and get this process through in the United States. I ask my colleagues. do you have confidence the public interest was really taken into considerationthat you run over the interests of private property owners on these issues? Was the department of environmental quality evaluation comprehensive? I can say one Nebraska landowner described the report as ""an incomplete evaluation of a natural resource with the magnitude of the Ogallala Aquifer. and now it is left in the hands of TransCanada to do their own policing."" Another family. who has been ranching for more than five generations in Nebraska. said the process left landowners with nowhere to turn with their concerns of erosion. water contamination or eminent domain. Another landowner had this to say about circumventing the process in Nebraska: I feel it is not in the best interest of Nebraska. nor the citizens of Nebraska. to have our legislators crafting special legislation to meet the specific demands of an individual corporation. I couldnt agree with them more. That is exactly what we are trying to do today. The same stakeholders in Nebraska have also questioned the appearance of conflict of interest associated with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality report since it was prepared by a contractor who also worked for TransCanada and Exxon on different joint pipeline projects. Meanwhile. a majority of the State Supreme Court. 4 out of 7 justices. just last week ruled that the legislature and the Governors actions were unconstitutional."
1140005071,To me this is an issue where we have had some debate about the pipeline and the oilspill liability trust fund. I would hope we would come back to that issue because these issues about spills and safety and security should be part of the debate. But I go back to the larger issue which is I hope we turn down this legislation overall. To me all of the issues we are talking about. whether it is about safe drinking water. whether it is about oilspills and the requirements on these companies or if it is about whether TransCanada can take U.S. property under eminent domain or whether it is about the route itself. all of these questions in my mind are premature for us. the Congress. to decide. Over 60 percent of the American people say they want this pipeline decided in a normal process. They want the State Department. in this instance because it crosses a border. to be the entity that determines national interest. So I do not want to predetermine that when there are so many important issues to be negotiated. The very company that wanted to negotiate with the State Department on this pipeline was negotiating some of the original routing. Yet at the very time the State Department was telling them the original routing would not work. they were here trying to persuade Members to vote for the authority to override the President and to give that routing. which we now know was flawed. I do not want to be premature about this. I do not want to be premature about cutting off debate. I want to get to these amendments before us and get the bill done with the input of my colleagues. given that the debate was brought up to the floor. If you ask me what I want to debate. I would be debating some other legislation because I do not think this bill is going to be signed by the President of the United States. I would be debating energy tax policy on clean energy items. I would be debating other things that I think would be impacting more our energy strategy for the future. our economy. and job creation. I think there are a lot of those out there. I hope my colleague from Alaska and I. once this debate is over with. will be able to sit down and talk about these issues. in a bipartisan fashion. and work with the committee. In 2007. we passed the Energy Independence and Security Act out of the energy committee on a bipartisan basis. It was landmark legislation that unleashed a lot of investment. It unleashed investment in making sure we had higher fuel efficiency cars in our country. which was good for the consumer because they got a car that got more mileage. It made investments in things such as the smart grid and other energy infrastructure. I hope that is what we will get back to. because when I look at what is happeningI know my colleague from Alaska just talked about some of these issues as it related to Alaska. I know she means what she says when she says she is speaking from the heart and working hard for Alaskans. I visited Alaska with her and my colleague. then- SenatorfromAlaska Mark Begich. I visited many parts of Alaska. I understand. Alaskans want to have an economic opportunity. They want their energy to be cheaper. I would say I am empathetic to the issue because we have five refineries in the State of Washington. We are the fifth largest refining State in the Nation. A lot of our oil comes from Alaska. So I can tell you that people in the Northwest are furious that even though we have those refineriesso a lot of refining capacity and the oil comes from Alaskawe still have some of the highest gas prices in the Nation. Many times we have asked for various investigations about why we have the highest gas prices in the Nation and why this issue continues to plague us. I know my colleague. when she speaks about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or ideas about more drilling. that it is about getting more oil supply. But more oil supply from Alaska has not helped Washington consumers have cheaper gasoline prices. So I want to continue to diversify our economy off of fossil fuels and onto other things. I hope we will get a chance to work on an energy bill that does that. If I could just address for a couple of minutes the issue of the Presidents decision to move forward on a plan that would help preserve the Arctic wildlife refuge as wilderness. My colleague from Alaska mentioned this issue is something that has been going on for some time. She is right. The predecessors that she and Ithe former chair of the energy committee. Scoop Jackson. and the former late Senator Ted Stevenseverybody has been a part of this. I actually was here at a pretty dramatic floor debate on this issue in 2005. in which some people wanted to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. even to the degree that they put that as a rider on the Defense bill. We were able to stop that. I think that was the will of Congress. that they did not want to see drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But we have had this discussion since 1960. when Dwight Eisenhower set aside originally 9 million acres. and in 1980. thanks to the work of Scoop Jackson. Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. which expanded the refuge to 19 million acres. I have visited the refuge. I do believe it is a critical habitat for wildlife and the Gwichin people who called this the sacred place where life begins. It is truly special. I do think we have had many discussions about this. This action probably will not be the last of them. but I do applaud the President for taking the Arctic refuge. which is habitat for 45 different species of land animals. 36 different species of fish. 180 species of birdsand has the greatest variety of plant and animal life of any park or refuge in the polar Arctic. I do believe it is an ecosystem and an ecosystem that is unlike anything else we have in the United States. So I am proud the President has taken what has been a refuge that was lacking a plan and has now put a wilderness plan in place or the elements of what it will take to preserve those various species and animals and that very special place. I know my colleague feels very strongly about the Presidents announcement. I think a refuge plan that is based on science and public commentwe have had a plan. but this is the first plan to say we are going to protect this area. It recommends 12 million acres of refuge. including the coastal plain as wilderness. It is one of the most pristine and unique public places. I am confident America can meet our energy needs without opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I am convinced we can come up with an energy strategy that is much more compelling for the future of the United States. one in which we can lead and one in which we can help other countries. whether it is what the President did with China in getting an agreement or working with India or all the things we are doing to try to be a leader in what is energy efficiency and ways to impact the marketplace so consumers can look for cleaner. more efficient uses of fuel. So this is going to be a continuing debate in this Congress between a 19th century view of energy policy and a 21st century view of energy policy. I would ask my colleagues to think about these countries the President has just recently visited. He went to China. No one thinks Chinas air standard is what we should have in the United States. India has had its own challenges. They have hundreds of millions of people who are without electricity needs. So the question is whether these sources of energy are going to be that solution. whether a dirty source of fossil fuel is going to be the solution or whether we can work together on cleaner energy solutions. I think we can do that. In fact. I am excited the United States can be a leader in these technologies. which will result in more job growth. just as those previous energy bills did when we worked together for higher fuel efficiency standards. for more energy efficiency. to come up with more sources of diversified fuel. I am very confident we are going to. in the next few years. usher in a new era of aviation. We have already proven we can fly airplanes with a 5050 drop in jet fuel. We now have to prove we can manufacture those large sources and get planes flying on that. What a great accomplishment that will be in reducing carbon emissions and giving the flying public and those airlines something that is much more affordable than what we have been dealing with for the last 10 or 15 years. I look forward to my colleague and I working tomorrowsome tonight and a little bit starting early tomorrowon how we move forward with this legislation. I know my colleague and I see a path forward. Similar to any two people who are trying to manage a bill on the floor. we also know we have all of our colleagues to work with because nothing in the Senate operates unless it operates through our process and working collaboratively or. I should say. it can work. it is just going to take a very long time. So we pledge to work in the next few days to try to get an amendment process that will not be prematurely cut off after 1 hour of a pending bill but will come to terms. and hopefully our colleagues will work with us to limit the number of those amendments and we can move forward to legislation that we think will help our economy grow.
1140028166,Mr. President. 4 years ago. I joined my Republican colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and voted to give the President of the United States trade promotion authority4 years ago. I have been a supporter of trade promotion authority for a long time. but I also realize that when it comes to trade. there are issues on which we have to work on together. We are at a juncture now where it is hard to move forward here in the Senate. I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that there are basic things about the future of America in a global economythe American people want to be assured that there are going to be tools for them to compete. So the fact that the Finance Committee and the negotiators of the trade promotion authority spent months and months on whether we were going to have TAAwhich is a program that helps laidoff workers who are impacted by tradebecause some House conservatives did not support trade adjustment authorityworkers being retrained when they are affected by trade agreementswe spent months and months because some conservatives in the House do not believe in government and do not believe in this program that helps support laidoff workers. Then we had to spend weeks and weeks out here because people on the other side of the aisleagain at the behest of conservatives in the Housedid not want to support enforcement. Now we are at this juncture because the same conservatives. because of an ideological belief by the Heritage Foundationnot something about business and labor. no. actually. business and labor support export tools. such as a credit agency that helps them sell their products. Again. this conservative group is holding up trade legislation because they do not think that it meets their political standards. as my colleague from South Carolina said. Senator GRAHAM. that it is all about some private organization they are trying to politically atone to. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I have been a supporter of TPA for a long time. but I do not plan to support a cloture motion and I do not plan to support moving ahead until we stop catering to this very minority group that does not support the basic tools the American people want to see when it comes to trade. They want to know that if they lose their jobs. they can get retrained. They want to know that if export markets are open. they will have some ability to sell their products to those developing markets that may not have a bank there but can help get financial support from a bank in the United States with the help of a Federal export credit agency. And yes. we have to have some basic tools on enforcement. So if the other side of the aisle wants to resolve these problems and move ahead on a trade agreement. they have to stop catering to the conservatives in the Houseand probably some of them do not even support trade overalland start working with the people who do support trade. As I said 4 years ago in the Finance Committee when I supported TPA. these policies are important tools for the U.S. economy. I feel strongly that in the developing world. trade can be a great asset in helping stabilize regions. I do not want to hold down other growing middle classes around the globe. We do not want to lose jobs here in the United States because of it. So lets have the tools that go along with trade. and lets get these bills passed. But if we are going to continue to cater to a group in the House who claims they do not want government. I do not see how. in this debate. we are going give the American people the tools that will give them security. I yield the floor.
1140054193,"Mr. President. I have introduced. along with Senator VITTER and Senator SHAHEEN. a bill that we believe will help break the glass ceiling women entrepreneurs face in this country. This month is National Womens Small Business Month. Throughout the month. the important contributions women entrepreneurs make to keep the economy growing will be highlighted. According the U.S. Small Business Administration. SBA. womenowned businesses are growing three times faster than their counterparts. Today. there are more than 10 million womenowned businesses across our country. They provide more than 23 million jobs and are expected to provide another five million additional jobs by 2018. In addition. onethird of all womenowned businesses are now owned by minorities. It is clear that we need to be investing more in our womenowned small businesses. That is why the legislation I am introducing today would help ensure that the next generation of women small business owners can get the training and counseling they need to turn their ideas into realities. This legislation would reauthorize the SBAs Womens Business Centers. WBCs. program for the first time since 1999. I am very pleased we were able to raise the authorized funding level for this critical counseling program to $21.7 million annually. Although the number of women entrepreneurs has continued to grow. funding for WBCs has remained flat for many years. Last year. when I was chair of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. we took a hard look at actions necessary to propel womens entrepreneurship forward and introduced legislation that addressed three components necessary to unlock their successincreasing access to federal contracts. increasing access to capital. and improving the training and counseling programs that support them. It became very clear that women all over the country agree that the Congress must take these additional steps. As Chair. I also issued a report. ""21st Century Barriers to Womens Entrepreneurship."" which demonstrated the need for the policy changes we seek in this legislation. I am pleased to say that on October 14. one of those goals will be achieved. The Small Business Administration has finalized solesource authority for the womens procurement programbringing the program and the women it serves in line with other Federal contracting programs. This will result in increased access to Federal contracts for women. The bill I introduced addresses another finding in the report which called for expanding training and counseling for women entrepreneurs. It does this by reauthorizing the SBAs Womens Business Center. WBC. program. which provides critical counseling. training. and other assistance to women. particularly in socially and economically disadvantaged communities. I cannot think of a better investment than one that helps women who want to create jobs and contribute to the economy. Womens Business Centers also provide important business counseling and training to underserved minority entrepreneurs. The need is greater than we knew last year. Since the Survey of Business Owners. published by the Census Bureau. was released this summer. a greater number of women have started businesses. The latest preliminary data showed that there are nearly 10 million womenowned firms in the United States. This is a 27 percent increase from the surveys last iteration in 2007 and a 50 percent increase in only a decade. Womenowned businesses generate more than $1.6 trillion in revenue. The report we issued last year showed that women entrepreneurs benefit from the customized business training and counseling Womens Business Centers provide to help level the playing field in starting and growing a small business. The majority of womenowned businesses are still under $24.999 in revenues. Women entrepreneurs receive only 4 percent of all commercial loan dollars. 17 percent of SBA loans. and 4.2 percent of venture capitalso there is plenty of work to be done. It is astonishing to me that more than 100 Womens Business Centers around the country are expected to serve this growing group of entrepreneurs. Womenowned small businesses generate needed income. According to a study released by the Association for Enterprise Opportunity. AEO. ""microbusinesses can be vital for income and wealth creation in underserved communities. In 2010. for instance. femaleheaded family households in which at least one person owned a microbusiness generated $8.000 to $13.000 more in annual household income than similar households without a business owner."" For lowincome households. this additional income is a path toward prosperity. The report goes on to say. ""the median net worth of business owners is almost two and a half times greater than that of nonbusiness owners."" Liz Jamieson. Director of the Washington Center for Women in Business. a WBC in Lacey. WA. explains why we need to increase support for Womens Business Centers. ""Since our inception in 2013. the Washington Center for Women in Business has coached and supported over 400 women entrepreneurs. to help them start. grow or scale up their companies. Weve also provided training and business skills development to over 1000 entrepreneurs in the same time frame. Our center would not exist without the partnership of the SBA. Even so. our center serves 34 of the 39 counties in Washington State. and two staff people can only do so much. although they do an extraordinary job and we get rave reviews. This legislation will empower us to empower far more entrepreneurs from all over our state. and to help them grow their businesses and create more jobs."" The legislation enjoys broad support by a number of key national organizations that support women business owners. The Association of Womens Business Centers. AWBC. Women Impacting Public Policy. WIPP. and the Association for Enterprise Opportunity. AEO. believe the changes we are proposing in this legislation are necessary to make this program open to more women. In closing. I would like to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this legislation. I also want to commend Chairman VITTER and Ranking Member SHAHEEN of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee for their hard work and dedication to assisting women entrepreneurs succeed. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation."
1140059192,Mr. President. I would like to thank my colleagues for coming to the Senate floor this morning to give an important message to our colleaguesthat it is now time to take up the ExportImport Bank issue and pass that legislation today. I thank my colleague from North Dakota. who has had this legislation in the Senate and has worked hard on the banking committee to make sure this legislation is moving forward and has been there at every step in the process. Being from a State that knows exports matter. she knows that having a finance regime that allows banks to take advantage of the fact that they need credit insurance has been a good thing for the American economy. It has helped us grow jobs in the United States. as we are selling exports to overseas markets. So she has been a stalwart. My colleague from New Hampshire who just left the floor. Senator SHAHEENI have visited her State and facilities and manufacturers involved in aerospace and other types of manufacturing that are trying to win in the international marketplace with their products by selling them overseas. When we cancel a program that actually helps us pay down the deficitthose individuals who get financing through a bank and a credit agency like the ExportImport Bank actually have to pay a fee. That has actually helped us reduce the deficit. It is money paid every year. and it helps us reduce the deficit. My colleague Senator SHAHEEN has been a great advocate for reauthorization of the ExportImport Bank. As my colleagues have talked about. the dirty little secret is out in Washington. that is. you cannot pass the ExIm Bank reauthorization because there is not enough support in the Congress to do so. Well. the answer is. that was a bunch of hooey promulgated by some very conservative think tanks that wanted to hold conservative Republicans hostage. and then they tried to hold all of us hostage. That is rightthey tried to hold all of us hostage. saying that we cannot pass this. We know the House of Representatives. with 313 votesa majority of the Republicans in the Housevoted for the reauthorization of the ExportImport Bank. They now join 67 people here who want to go to and move that legislation in the Senate. So the majority of people in both the House and Senate have supported the reauthorization of the ExportImport Bank and have done so for more than a year. but we let it expire. What happened? We let down the American economy because the end result has been a loss of jobs. I will give one example of 850 jobs that went from U.S. companies over to these countries instead because without the ExportImport Bank. they lost deals that went to other places because other countries also have credit agencies that help small and regional banks finance the sale of U.S.-made products. As they are being sold to say South Africa or an Asian country or someplace else. the companies cannot find the financinga lot of agricultural productsand so they come to a bank in their community and say: Help finance my sales overseas. In fact. Senator MURRAY and I met with a greatmy colleague from North Dakota will like thismicrobrew manufacturer in Ballard. WA. and they said: You know. we are trying to sell into the Scandinavian market. They like our products. but we are not big enough as a distributor to finance the sale of our products into those markets. So we either have to take that on our books ourselves or find a way to take our company and leverage it with some capital to increase our market exports. So what did they do? They tried to minimize that. Otherwise. do you know what that company would have to do? They would have to take all their capital and put it aside to leverage that money to expand the market. Instead. they said: Well. lets go to a bank and get them to loan us the money so we can expand our products into Scandinavia. where people love drinking this Ballard beer. The bank says: Well. we like that idea. We like you. You are doing well. But we are a little afraid of your selling into that distribution market in Scandinavia. We want you to have some credit insurance. That is what the ExportImport Bank does. It says to that banker in Ballard: We will provide you a little credit insurance. Do you have to pay a fee for that? Yes. you have to pay a fee for that. What does that fee do? It helps the Federal Government pay down the deficit. Who wins? We all win because that Ballard company now gets to grow. I would say that over in Scandinavia. they get to drink great beer that is made in Washington State. As one of the largest hops producers in the United States. my colleague from an agricultural State understands this. So everybody wins. Then the Ballard company gets to expand jobs. So that is what this is all about. In this instance. we lost 850 jobs.
1140059195,I thank the Senator from North Dakota for that question because that is the issue. What people dont understand is that there are so many of these deals thatbasically there was a U.S. company that wanted to sell its ability to build bridges to an African country. Yet. because the ExportImport Bank expired. that African country ended up basically going with a competitor. an Asian competitor. Same thing here. When we dont finance these dealsI know of a deal that GE lost to RollsRoyce. Why? Because the credit agency in Europe could finance the deal. so they just bought a different product. The issue is not that somehow the private sector is going to step in here and basically help in a capital market. It is the same way the Small Business Administration works. The Small Business Administration has 7(a) loans to help finance the sales that basically go through Main Street banking. but the Small Business Administration provides a little certainty and predictability to the process so that we are not seeing huge losses. Basically. the Small Business Administration has not seen large defaults. and neither has the ExportImport Bank. So these are tools that basically people try to say to us will be picked up somehow. that the private sector will respond to this. Well. in developing markets around the world. when U.S. manufacturers are trying to compete and build a great product. all you are doing by killing the ExportImport Bank is enabling some other manufacturer in Europe or Asia or South America to compete with our manufacturers on an uneven playing field. You are giving them an advantage our manufacturers dont have. So. literally. people on the other side of the aisle have shipped jobs overseas by saying they dont want to support the ExportImport Bank. and they have held it up for so many months now that we have lost jobs. This is only one example. There have been tens of thousands of jobs lost since the Export ImportBank failed to get reauthorized. Now the question is. Why are we going to wait 1 more day? Now that the House has passed the bill. with a majority of Republicans supporting it. why would we wait 1 more day to pass a key tool that is instrumental in supporting jobs in the United States of America? I hope my colleaguesI appreciate so much my colleague from North Dakota talking about this because. you know. beingI dont if it is that we are ag States. that we see how much the global economy means to our States. but we know this: that 95 percent of consumers are outside of our borders and that if we want to increase our economic activity in the United States and grow jobs. we better be selling to those 95 percent of consumers outside of the United States. If you want to sell to those 95 percent of consumers outside of the United States. first you have to build a great product or develop a great agricultural product. but then you have to be able to have the competitive tools to reach them from a financing and banking system. So the funny thing is that all of those people on the other side who basically act as though they are against the ExportImport Bank because they think it is some sort of mysterious organization. those are the people who basically wanted to bail out Wall Street. They are the ones who are behind the big banks. They are the ones who are trying to basically disassemble all of the banking reforms we passed to protect the American consumers. So they are not for some sort of great. good government. they basically are just looking for a trophy to put on their mantle to say that. oh. we killed this government program. which. as I have said. is wrong because it actually helps us create jobs in the United States of America. it helps U.S. manufacturers win in the United States of America. it helps us get our products to places they would not already go. and it helps pay down the Federal deficit. So it is a winwin situation for all of us. What we have to do now is to get this reauthorized. We should not wait another minute. The notion that all of my colleagues should take away from this is that a minority of people holding up voting on this has also been wrongheaded. To allow a minority to thwart what is such an essential tool has been a mistake. What we need to do is right that mistake immediately by passing this legislation here in the Senate. get the Bank back operating. let our U.S. manufacturers and agricultural producers win again in the international marketplace. and help our economy grow with these important jobs that are related to exports. I again thank my colleague for being down here on the Senate floor. We are not going to give up. We are going to be down here. That is because. as you know. we are having all of these budget discussions. and people should remember that over the last 20 years. the ExportImport Bank has generated $7 billion to the Treasury-$7 billion over 20 years. So not only does it help us grow jobs. it actually has helped us pay down the deficit. I hear a lot of discussion about budget deals and transportation packages and things of that nature. So. to me. if you want to put more revenue back into our coffers. then support the ExportImport Bank immediately and you will be recognizing immediate revenue for any of these budget discussions that we are having and that we need to move forward on. I am not under the impression that somehow all of the people in the Senate are now going to support this legislation and that it is going to move quickly. because there will still be some on the other side of the aisle who dont support moving forward. But I would say that number-$7 billion over 20 yearsI think it is worth a few procedural 60vote thresholds to get that money and to give Americans the certainty that this particular program will be reinstated and that we will be back to letting hardworking Americans who build a great product get the credit assurances they need to sell their products on a global basis and to win in the international marketplace. That is what America is all about. Dont hold these people down. They are the people who created. with great ingenuity and great sweat. the great products that have made our country great. So let them export their products. Dont make it harder for them just because you want to win a trophy from the Heritage Foundation. Lets get back to making sure we are making this place operate. We know the majority both in the House and Senate supports the ExportImport Bank and the jobs it creates. Lets get this bill reauthorized today.
1140064519,"Mr. President. last year the Pacific Northwest. and the Nation lost one of our greatest civil rights heroes with the passing of Billy Frank. Jr. It is clear a great leader has been lost when an entire community shows up to commemorate his life and celebrate his spirit. I attended Billys memorial. along with Senator MURRAY and 6.000 others. and was honored to have the chance to pay tribute to the man who fought for the civil rights of Native Americans. the principles of environmental stewardship. and the importance of salmon recovery and preservation in the Pacific Northwest. Today. I am introducing the Billy Frank Jr. Tell Your Story Act. which would change the name of the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge to the ""Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge."" In addition. this legislation would create a national memorial to commemorate the signing of the Medicine Creek Treaty. the treaty that Billy Frank fought so hard to enforce. within the refuge. The wildlife refuge sits adjacent to the Nisqually Reservation where Billy grew up and lived. and contains the estuary and salmon that Billy devoted his life to protecting. Billy Frank. Jr. just wanted to fish. He was a fisherman to his core. and thats how he wanted history to remember him. Everyone who knew Billy would want us to remember him as the legend that walked and fished among us. Given his life. his legacy. and the way he changed Washington State and the Nation. it is only right that we honor his legacy by forever linking his name to the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge. Along with his advocacy for protecting Tribal treaty rights. Billy Frank changed the way we look at the environment. Because of his advocacy. we now have environmental restoration efforts throughout the Puget Sound. including at the Nisqually River Delta. the largest tidal marsh rehabilitation in the Northwest. Additionally. we have the Puget Sound Partnership. a Tribal and publicprivate partnership dedicated to improve the health of our Puget Sound. Billy understood that we have a sacred responsibility to be stewards of our environment. and that we must leave it for future generations in better condition than it was left to us. The Billy Frank Jr. Tell Your Story Act has the support of the Nisqually Tribe and the neighboring Puyallup Tribe. along with the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians. the National Congress of American Indians. and the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. A companion bill introduced by Congressman Denny Heck has been approved by the House Natural Resources Committee and is awaiting consideration by the House. I urge its passage in the Senate. especially given the recent decision by President Obama to posthumously award Billy the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Billy grew up listening to the stories of his father and others belonging to the Nisqually and other tribes. Routinely harassed for fishing his tribes namesake Nisqually River with nets. Willie Frank. Sr. recalled a warden telling him. ""Your treaty isnt worth the paper its printed on."" Billys father always told him. ""Just keep fishing. Even if they arrested you. just keep fishing. Even if they beat you just keep fishing. Keep fishing and claim what was promised in the in the Medicine Creek Treaty."" By changing the name of the Nisqually wildlife refuge. we will not only honor the fisherman that fought to protect the land and its people. but we will make this land better than it was left to us. just like Billy Frank. Jr. would have wanted. By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. GRAHAM):"
1140070309,"Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Florida for coming to the floor and speaking so articulately about the need for help for Puerto Rico. His State is the most impacted State in the United States when it comes to our policy as it relates to Puerto Rico. He is right that there are not many Puerto Ricans in the State of Washington. But as the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. which has jurisdiction for the territories. I can tell you territorial oversight is about giving people who are U.S. citizens fair access to the law. If we are not going to help people who are U.S. citizens have fair access to the law. I am not sure why we are continuing to say that they are a territory of the United States of America. What we are talking about. and the Senator from Florida understands this. is if you dont give them fair treatment under the law. just as we do with individual citizens who need to reorganize their debt. businesses who need to reorganize their debt. municipalities that need to reorganize their debt. or even the United States of America in the big bank bailout basically allowing a lot of people to reorganize their debt. then we wont let the people in Puerto Rico come to a resolution of their debt in bankruptcy. It is a hypocrisy that is unexplainable at the moment. We should get to the bottom of this because we want to give fair treatment to Puerto Rico so they can solve their own problems. What my colleague mentioned is that a restructuring authority for Puerto Rico costs the U.S. taxpayers zero. Zero dollars. That is to say. we are not proposing. at least on our side of the aisle. that we give them immediate funds to restructure. We are simply saying: Give them the tools of bankruptcy so they can restructure. My colleagues think this is important because we know that the mass exodus from Puerto Rico. which has been about 300.000 people in the last several years. will continue if we dont give them the tools to reorganize their debt. What that will mean. as the Senator from Florida mentioned. is that people will come in droves to Florida and continue to impact that economy by asking for federal social services that are capped in Puerto Rico. They will come to Florida and ask for those services. So the United States. by denying Puerto Rico the bankruptcy tools. actually will be impacted economically. Some people have estimated the impact will be as much as $10 to $20 billion over a 10year period of time. I would say we have a lot of skin in the game to get people to reorganize this debt. Many newspapers across the United States also believe that we should give Puerto Rico these tools to reorganize. In an editorial recently in the New York Times. which talked about the Presidents proposal. it said: ""Crucially. it asks Congress to change the law so that Puerto Ricos territorial government and municipalities can seek bankruptcy protection."" They understood this issue. as did the Washington Post when they wrote: "". . . letting an impartial bankruptcy judge sort out the competing claims on a failed public entity is the fairest. most efficient approach. without that option. Puerto Rico has no leverage in debt negotiations. and litigation could ensue."" So there are newspapers throughout the United States of America that are looking at this issue and saying: Give them the ability to reorganize their debt. Why is this so important? Because the Puerto Rican government may default on its debt as early as January 1. when nearly $1 billion in payments are due. Many of us here want to see a resolution of this issue now. giving them the tools to avoid that. Once they default. the economic impact to the rest of us and the U.S. taxpayers will be far greater. Why do I say that? Because if you look at the inaction that takes place. U.S. taxpayers contribute $6.4 billion to Puerto Ricos annual budget. funding these various programs. If you default. that means we will be spending more than $6.4 billion. I know some of my colleagues want to protect the hedge funds from being a part of the bankruptcy reorganization. But. when you are protecting the hedge funds from being a part of the bankruptcy reorganization. you are adding costs for the U.S. taxpayers. That is something we cannot afford. If Puerto Rico is allowed to restructure their debt. they could make these decisions and save us money as U.S. taxpayers. In the long run. as I said. it would prevent the mass exodus from the island to many other States and provide Puerto Rico with the tools they need. Yet some in Congress are more comfortable with inaction. which basically is just bad public policy. Why is this? Because 20 to 50 percent of the islands debt is owned by hedge funds. These hedge funds swoop in to buy cheap Puerto Rican debt and are using their influence here in Washington. DC. to block Puerto Rico from access to bankruptcy protection that is allowed in other places. It is no secret that the solution will require sacrifice by everyone. and that is what we want to see. If Congress continues to protect these hedge funds and fails to act. it will be at both the expense of the Puerto Rican people. who have already suffered immensely. and of the American taxpayer. Sitting by idly is not a solution. We should remind our colleagues that Puerto Rico had preexisting bankruptcy authority which was taken away in 1984. mysteriously. Nobody knows why. or how. or any justification for it. They just know that it disappeared. Congress should reinstate that authority that was taken away. As the Governor of Puerto Rico said before the energy committee. quoting another leader: ""Give us the tools. and we will finish the job."" Now is the time to act. before we see a greater mass exodus of people. This chart shows the migration between Puerto Rico and the United States. You see that it continues to grow. It has grown 500 percent in the last 10 years. The issue is that now government workers are being cut to three days a week. patients are waiting for months without basic medical care. hospitals are going bankrupt. and the health industry is about to collapse. On the other side of the aisle there is talk about the humanitarian crisis that might occur next year and how they might want to respond to it. but they dont want to stand up and say to the hedge funds that they also have to take some responsibility in this issue. Fortyfive percent of the population in Puerto Rico is now living in poverty. including 58 percent who are children. Unemployment is in double digits. and it is. if you compare it to all our States. very high in the ranking of States in the United States. As a result. 80.000 people are leaving the island each year as part of a mass migration. So what is the solution? As we said: Restructure their debt. give them the tools to restructure their debt. It costs nothing to the U.S. taxpayer. saves us money in the long run. prevents a mass exodus from the island. and prevents more spending on Federal benefits to people who might migrate to the United States. We think this ought to be a lot of motivation to sit down and solve this issue today. In fact. now we are hearing from different businesses. and I will submit one letter for the RECORD. in the United States that do business in Puerto Rico and that dont want to lose their investment because they are so concerned about the level of collapse that could happen in Puerto Rico. and the loss of infrastructure and infrastructure investment. So why do we need to continue to move forward? Well. inaction. basically. is to say that the hedge funds have won in this game. Twenty to fifty percent of the islands debt is owned by the hedge funds. and hedge funds are using their influence in Washington to block a Puerto Rico bill from coming to the floor. Failure to act would be at the expense. as I said. of taxpayers and individuals. Just yesterday. a leader who has been supportive of reorganization of a task force in New York that was under a budget crisis said: ""The hedge funds got their way in Congress."" That is referring to the fact that we were not able to get. as my colleague from Florida said. this legislation as part of the budget omnibus bill or other bills moving through the process. So now is the time to act to give Puerto Rico the tools. Now is the time for all of those who have made investments to say ""we all have to come to the table and resolve this issue."" The longer we wait. the greater the risk for the United States of Americato say nothing of the issue of a territory that we lay claim to. giving them the ability to solve their problems. I ask my colleagues to come to a commonsense resolution on this issue. Stop protecting these hedge funds and start working for people who are called U.S. citizens. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the articles and the letter I mentioned."
1140098965,Mr. President. I join my colleagues this morning on the Senate floor in an effort to wake up the Senate to the fact that. without action by this body and specifically the Senate Banking Committee. Members are literally supporting shipping jobs overseas. I believe in a manufacturing economy. I believe in a manufacturing economy because so many people in the State of Washington work in manufacturing and because aerospace is an industry in which the United States is still a world leader. Yet. by not filling the board of the ExportImport Bank we are putting the Bank out of business when we should be making sure that it can issue credit for manufactured U.S. products to be sold in overseas markets. Why is manufacturing so important? Manufacturing is important because it pays a decent wage. It allows American workers to go from working class to middle class. It helps secure jobs in our economy that are stable for families who are sending their kids to school. and because it helps people move up to a better quality of life. I am competitive in general. I dont want to lose a manufacturing base. But I also dont want to lose a middle class. What has happened is that the conservative views of the Heritage Foundation have thwarted the ExportImport Bank. and U.S. manufacturers have decided to put their manufacturing overseas. Think about it. How long is a company or a business going to put up with the fact that they dont have an export credit agency here in the United States? Now. can a big manufacturer get its own credit? Sure it can. Sure. it can go and get credit. But can you ask it to sell in a global market? I will give you an example of a manufacturer in our State. SCAFCO. which sells manufactured grain silos to many countries in South America. in Africa. in Asia. and all across the world. Do you think they are going to finance every single deal they do? No. because they have to put money into their manufacturing facilities so they can stay competitive. and so they can have the best silos being produced. So if they limited their business to only deals they could finance. they would have very limited business. Think about it. Whom do we make that requirement of? It is the customer who is buying the exported product who needs the business to get credit. It is the customer who is out there that wants to purchase what are great U.S. products who is having trouble. Think about it. You could be a small African nation trying to change your economy toward agriculture or you could be a small Asian country that is trying to upgrade the quality of life. It could be. just as Prime Minister Modi said yesterday. that they want to diversify their energy portfolio. Well. guess what? We are holding that up and not allowing all of those countries to buy U.S. energy products simply because we refuse to have a working board at the export credit agency. How ludicrous is that? It is so ludicrous. because what happens if a U.S. manufactureran aerospace manufacturer like Boeing for examplewants consumers to buy GE engines and make sure that a South American company purchases U.S. manufactured Boeing and GE engines? Well. they can go and purchase RollsRoyce engines instead. and the European credit agency can fund the deal. Now. what has happened? GE has lost out on deals. Do you think all of those U.S. manufacturers are going to stay in the United States if there is no way to have credit financing? Nothey are going to go where credit financing exists. So. by not moving forward on a fully functioning export credit agency in the United States. all you are doing is helping to ship jobs overseas. It has to stop. We make great products in the United States. We are competitive. Our workforce is skilled. I will be the first to say that we need a more skilled workforce. I am all for providing our workforce with education and skills and every resource our country has because innovation is our competitive advantage. But if we make great products and then we hamstring the financing of those great productsdeveloping countries dont have the same banking and financial tools and edge that we have in the United Statesyou are basically saying: We are not going to sell our products. I am a big proponent of winning in the international marketplace. I am a big proponent of saying that the middle class is growing around the globe. and one of the United States biggest economic opportunities is to sell products to that middle class outside of the United States. That rising middle class means they can purchase more U.S. products. Well. they cant if we dont have a credit agency that finances exports. So why are we down here this morning as it relates to the Defense bill that is now being discussed? Well. we are here because there are more than $10 billion of deals and transactions that are in the ExportImport Bank pipeline. Yesterday. Prime Minister Modi was here. The Indian Government has announced that Westinghouse would finalize contracts with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India to build six nuclear reactors by 2030. Well. those deals wont get done if you dont have an export credit agency to finance those deals. The United States Senate is currently considering the National Defense Authorization Act. Last month. the Aerospace Industries Association and the National Defense Industrial Association wrote letters to Senate leadership urging them to make sure that we had a functioning bank. They pointed out that without a quorum. multimilliondollar exports of aircraft. satellite. and other things wont get done. So we just had this little argument on the Senate floor about how we are going to pay for things in the Defense bill and whether we are going to have balance with our other domestic spending. By not supporting and moving forward on the export credit agency. you are also making defense in the United States more expensive. You are making our security more expensive because you are not allowing that same technologythat we have decided meets our export controls. but we are willing because these are partners of oursto sell that defense. You are making that difficult. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD this letter from the Aerospace Industries Association and the National Defense Industrial Association. basically saying you are making it more expensive for us to do business as a country in defense because you also will not allow the export of this product.

1130014077,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the general premise of this bill but oppose the legislation as is due to the inclusion of the NEPA waiver. Today we are debating H.R. 678. a bill that should be noncontroversial. In fact. it should have already been enacted into law. We all agree that adding small conduit hydropower projects is a great ideano. its really a wonderful ideaand H.R. 678 could have easily been passed through the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. But. unfortunately. my esteemed colleagues on the other side have chosen to turn this noncontroversial bill into a partisan fight over ideology by waiving compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. NEPA. for Federal conduit projects. As my colleague from Washington indicated. it means jobs. It means the addition of clean energy. It means all of those things. but to the exclusion of NEPA. As the gentleman mentioned. H.R. 678 would amend the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 and. thus. would facilitate and expand the private development of small conduit hydropower at the Bureau of Reclamation facilities. The legislation seeks to accomplish several goals. the most important of which is authorizing reclamation to develop and increase power at most of those facilities. H.R. 678 also includes a provision that waives NEPA for all conduit projects generating less than 5 megawatts. The bill waives NEPA. which is on page 4. lines 14 to 18. even though the Bureau of Reclamation has implemented a categorical exclusion on their own accord to apply to small conduit projects. You may call it theoretical. but it has only been there 6 months. and it takes government a long time to get the word out to those parties. The waiver of NEPA in this bill is unnecessary. since Reclamation has already implemented this guidance through this categorical exclusion. The legislation seeks to solve a NEPA problem that does not exist. Unfortunately. some Members on the other side of the aisle have characterized the waiver of NEPA as ""the main purpose of this legislation."" The waiver in this bill is the exact same waiver that Republicans put into the nearly identical bill last Congress. Just like the last time. the Senate will not pass it. and the bill will again expire in the Senate. This is totally unnecessary. This is not what anyone on this side of the aisle wants to see happen. and we would support the bill without the NEPA waiver. Mr. Chairman. I oppose this legislation and ask my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130023262,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. The pending measure was introduced in the Senate on May 16 of this year. 2013. and passed the very same day. While the bill is apparently a Senaterevised version of the legislation introduced in February of 2013. no committee hearings or markups were held on either bill. Since 1996. the Army Corps of Engineers has been required to establish restricted areas for hazardous waters upstream and downstream of all Corps dams. As written. S. 982 would revise the current agency policy and would also prohibit the Army Corps of Engineers from establishing any restricted areas in hazardous waters at dams and other structures in the Cumberland River basin for a period of 2 years. and also require them to remove any physical barriers that already exist to prevent access to the hazardous areas. If after the 2year moratorium. the Corps decided to implement new restricted areas around these dams and other structures. it would continue to be prohibited from erecting any physical barriers to prevent people from entering hazardous areas. Mr. Speaker. I have serious concerns over this legislation because it does pose risks for public safety and national security. Currently. the Corps restricts access to certain areas above and below the dams of the Cumberland River basin in order to keep people from being sucked into the spill waste or from having their boats swamped or sunk by unplanned releases from the hydropower units. which are very much untimed. The reason they do this is very simple: to prevent people from drowning and to restrict access to Federal dams that would be targets for terrorism or destruction. Without fulltime law enforcement patrols. areas above and below dams are not constantly monitored. and the Corps has not been able to alert and rescue people who get into trouble. They have to base it on people who are in boats nearby to help effect a rescue. Fourteen people drowned in the last few years. and there have been 20 near misses where there is no Corps staff to help. In fact. according to a report by WRCBTV in Chattanooga. Tennessee. there have been three fatalities in the hazardous waters immediately downstream of those dams on the Cumberland River. The waters are so hazardous at these locations that wearing a life jacket is ineffective. And I repeat: ineffective. To legislatively preclude a Federal agency from protecting public health and national security seems a very unwise course of action. and I have significant concerns about the precedent that would be set by this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130048876,"Mr. Chairman. my amendment is very simple. On page 25. after line 12. it adds a new section. Section 10. the savings clause. would require that there be no adverse impacts on water quantity and water quality in the development of this project. This year. over half of our Nation is experiencing moderate to severe drought. As of last week. 75 percent of the State of Arizona is in moderate to severe drought. The lifeblood of any nation. of any country. is water. We must do everything we can to protect this precious resource. The mining activities of Resolution Copper. a joint subsidiary of Australian BHP Billiton and of Anglo Australian Rio Tinto Group. would require an enormous amount of water. estimated to be more than 20.000 to 40.000 acrefeet per year. In fact. the Forest Service testified that understanding the impact of this mine on the water supplies of local communities is still ""outstanding."" On average. 1 acrefoot of water is enough water for a family of four for a year. Resolution Coppers water could be equivalent to at least 20.000 households water supply for a year. They also erroneously suggest that their own water demands could be solved by the use of Central Arizona Project water. called the CAP. However. as with most of the West. demand often exceeds supply. and the bulk of the Central Arizona Project water is already dedicated and committed to other uses and users in Arizona. This includes for use in future Arizona Indian water rights settlements. The proposed mining operation would also require significant excavation thousands of feet below the surface. H.R. 687 does not require an environmental review. does not include consideration of mitigation measures to the mining project before the land exchange is completed. And I repeat: it does not require an environmental review. consideration of mitigation measures of the mining project before the land exchange is completed. The mining company is also not required to submit a plan of operations until 3 years3 yearsafter the land exchange is codified. Absent the NEPA process. the impacts to water would not be known prior to the land exchange. Neighboring communities have already seen an impact to their water resources from other mining activities. Chairman Rambler of the San Carlos Apache tribe testified in March of this year. right here in Washington. D.C.. that a neighboring communitys water supply had been significantly depleted since Resolution Copper began pumping groundwater to dewater parts of the Magma Mine. H.R. 687s permitting of the mine at Oak Flat brings up similar concerns for the tribe. We should not be considering this legislation now since we do not know the impacts to water resources for area tribes. At the very least. we should ensure that we do not violate existing laws to protect water quantity and water quality. That is what my amendment does. It protects water quality and water quantity. My amendment seeks to protect our most precious resource. water. And I urge my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130073790,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I would invite my colleague to visit southern California to check with the rest of California on how we are handling the drought. Ninetyeight percent of California. as shown by this map. is in drought. We are entering the third year of drought. the driest on record in California. This bill. H.R. 3964. the SacramentoSan Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act. targets Californias Central Valley only and was introduced 1 week ago with no hearing. no markup. no conversation. nothing. a partisan bill. introduced only by California Republicans. with no meaningful conversation or cooperation with the rest of the California Members. who are all facing similar drought impacts. It is similar to H.R. 1837 from 2011 in the last Congress. and it died in the Senate. as was pointed out. According to the California Department of Water Resources. the snowpack in the Sierras. the largest reservoir in the Central Valley Project System. was 6 percent of normal. Last week. the National Drought Monitor found that 98 percent of the State is experiencing moderate to severe droughtso dry in California that in the first 18 days of January. the State saw 289 fires that burned 721 acres. including the Colby fire partly in my district. The State has hired nearly 100 more firefighters and used a super water scooper airplane. at a time when California should be experiencing its wettest month. California Natural Resources Secretary Laird said it best in a letter: ""This bill falsely holds the promise of water relief that cannot be delivered because. in this drought. the water simply does not exist."" This legislation. instead. reallocates water in a way that erroneously elevates junior water rights uses above all other water needs. including municipal. fisheries and environmental uses. It repeals existing State law for water use in California. establishing a very harmful precedent for other States. It repeals sections 104. 107. 108. 110. 204. and 401 that explicitly waive State law or reclamation law. It repeals historic California water rights and decades of carefully balanced water compromises. It undermines California and other States abilities to manage its own resources. It overturns nearly 20 years of environmental and conservation protections under the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. CVPIA. and the Endangered Species Act. and ignores the best available science demonstrating the negative effects on species. We are. in fact. a species too. the human species. It repeals the Federal and State agreement on the courtordered San Joaquin Restoration Settlement Act. It prohibits Federal or State governments from exercising valid water rights in order to conserve. enhance. recover. or otherwise protect any species that is affected by operations of the CVP or State Water Project. It also reallocates water for junior water rights holders in the Central Valley and ignores the needs of southern California and other water users while privatizing a public resource for a select few. It does notI repeatdoes not create any new water to solve the drought. It completely eliminates the coequal goal of protecting the environment and allowing water deliveries. It eliminates that coequal code. It puts jobs at risk. not only for fishermen but also the economy. It would revert contract renewal terms to 40 years instead of the current 25. Mr. Chairman. the severity of this legislation benefits a very small group. It does not benefit all of droughtimpacted California. It needs the cooperation of a bipartisan solution for all of the State. including southern California. Water bonds in the past have favored northern California. The levee funding favored the Bay Delta. and H.R. 3964 favors Central Valley farmers only. Southern California wants and needs to be included in a dialogue and be part of the solution. We are currently in dialogue with the Senators on a drought bill. Title XVI. which is recycled water. WaterSMART. Republicans have been stonewalling ideas. They are not allowing bills to be given the courtesy of a hearing in the subcommittee or full committee. The Bureau of Reclamation is working with WaterSMART project funding of only $27.5 million and water recycling project funding. Title XVI. of $21.5 million. with a backlog of $400 million in congressionally approved projects. Mr. Chairman. I will submit letters in opposition: from the White House. a statement and a veto threat. from the Governor of California. Governor Brown. from the California Department of Natural Resources Secretary John Laird. from California Attorney General Kamala Harris. and from 34 diverse California environmental groups. The Western States Water Council indicates their opposition has not changed to the provisions that preempt states rights. The bill will just create more litigation over water and not solve anything. We need to work on a bipartisan basis on putting that forth. H.R. 3964 is not such an attempt. I urge all my colleagues to vote ""no"" on H.R. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130073841,"Mr. Chairman. my amendment to H.R. 3964 is very. very simple. It is an inconvenient truth. however. that it creates a revenue stream to the Treasury by eliminating an irrigation subsidy which requires irrigators to pay project debt with interestin other words. ending free taxpayer subsidy since 1902. which has been in place since reclamation was created. It requires that any new water contracts or renewed contracts must reflect the price of water with interest and repay the debt of the project to only the Treasury with interest. This will be of small assistance to balancing our national debt. When reclamation was established in 1902. it was meant to deliver water to farms with approximately 160 acres. Subsequent congressional action has changed the acreage limitation along with the repayment contract for these projects. So. in 1982. acreage was increased to 960 acres. Congressional action has also made the repayment of project debt interest free for irrigators while municipalities. like my constituentsmy water peopleand power users pay the required appropriate interest. I wish other State water users were as lucky as these folks. H.R. 3964 removes the role of the Federal Government in protecting environment and public good. That is not good. If we are removing the role of the Federal Government. then we should also remove the Federal subsidy associated with renewed or new water contracts. My constituents and anybody elses must fairly and equally repay additional interest on any project. and they have. For over a decade. southern California foresaw needed infrastructure. and many local entities stepped up to the plate and provided some relief. We paid for and constructed new storage facilities. like the Diamond Valley Lake Reservoir. entirely paid for by local groups and without one Federal cent. adding 1 million acres of new storage. This is on top of the investments we have made in title XVIrecycled water. which has only a 25 percent Federal matchwhich created 680.000 acrefeet in California alone. Lets end this interestfree subsidy at our taxpayers expense. at all of Americas taxpayers expense. Eliminating this unfair subsidy will help to cut our deficit. and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on this amendment. With regard to a statement that was just made on the Bay Delta. it seems that Secretary Babbitt and the Secretary of Natural Resources were the ones who actually passed the Bay Delta Accord. and 3 years were spent by Mr. GARAMENDI in trying to implement this. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130080135,"Madam Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. The legislation we have to consider today is flawed on many levelsit is flawed on process. it is flawed on policy. and it is flawed in claiming that it protects States water rights. H.R. 3189 does not solve the problemit creates more problemsbecause it is so broadly written and has no chance of being enacted into law. The majority introduced the Water Rights Protection Act as a way to protect private property rights. It is not about protecting private property rights. It is not about protecting States water rights. It goes in the opposite direction. that of creating a new Federal definition of a ""water right"" when we have not had a hearing on that particular point. Water rights have. for more than four centuries in American law. been defined as a matter of State law. If the majority is really concerned about Federal overreach. creating a sweeping new Federal definition of a ""water right"" without even a single hearing is not the best choice. H.R. 3189 only had a hearing. and it was held during the government shutdown. during the sequestration. As a result. the agencies affected were not able to provide expert analysis because they were not able to be at the hearing to talk to the bills impacts. The bills incomplete legislative record was worsened by the committee markup. whereby a clumsily drafted savings clause was added. This only added to the confusion as to the purpose of the bill. negating the purpose of the legislation. which I understand now makes it a broader bill in addressing some of the issues. as have been stated by my colleague. that it is overreach by the Obama administration. thus negating the water rights. Today. the managers amendment. with four additional savings clauses. continues to show the magnitude of the unintended negative consequences that H.R. 3189 would have on various activities that require a Federal permit. There is some agreement on this bill. We both agree that the starting point of this legislation involves a conflict between the Forest Service and the ski resorts. which was the focus of the hearing. Unfortunately. the Forest Service issued a declaration. a release. that mandated certain things that are objectionable to my colleagues. and they are now having to set out a new policy directive that is under consideration by the OMB. We have not waited for the results of the OMB. We cant tell until after the comment period is given to the general public. and then it can be published. There are currently 121 ski resorts located in 13 States that are operating on Federal Forest Service land. That is public land that belongs to the general public. It doesnt belong to the ski resorts. and it doesnt belong to this body. It belongs to the people. Through longterm special use permits. these resort companies are operating on publictaxpayerland. belonging to the American people. for private profit. In many cases. these companies purchase water rights in order to operate the resort. The Forest Service is currently struggling with what happens with the permitting of sales of water rights. How could the agency find a new operator if there is no water to go with that land and if it is not available. if there is no water for the land? The Forest Service issued a directive in 2011 requiring that. as a condition of these special use permits. the applicant must place its water rights in the name of the United States. Who is the United States if it isnt the American taxpayer? To be clear. this was not because President Obama is mad with power and wants to own water rights. as some have alluded to. Rather. it was so that the Forest Service could include those water rights as part of the package when seeking a new operator and issuing a new contract for an existing ski area on publictaxpayerland. The court validated that directive on procedural grounds. and the Forest Service is currently working on a new directive. as they have stated in the letter to this committee. One. they have said. will not involve permit applicants transferring their water rights to the Federal Government. It would be appropriate to consider legislation that really pinpoints and clarifies that ski area permits may not be conditioned on the transfer of water rights to the government. New legislation devising a real solution to this problem would not only be welcomed. it would be a necessity. This is why we support the Polis amendment. which addresses the narrow conflict between the ski resorts and the Forest Service. which is the real conflict. This bill would prevent the entire Department of Agriculture and the entire Department of the Interior from conditioning any use of public property on the impairment of any water right. This bill goes well beyond ski resorts and well beyond the Forest Service to fundamentally alter publictaxpayerland management. including the management of all units of the National Park System. If this bill were to become law. grazing permits could no longer require that some water be left in the streams for the cattle. and bypass flows would be impacted. Any and all uses of public lands which touch on water would be affected. Without the ability to condition permits or authorizations on reasonable protections for waterdependent resources. such as habitat. timber. or recreation. agencies will not be able to comply with the conservation and multipleuse mandates required currently by law. The bill is so broad and so irresponsible that. if it were to be enacted. it would mean the very end of the public lands activities it is supposed to protect. because those activities could no longer be managed responsibly. Congress should get out of the way. respect States rights. and allow the Forest Service to issue its new directive. which is not the taking of anyones property. Rather. it is placing responsible conditions on a permit allowing private companies to profit from their use of publictaxpayerlands. Finally. Madam Chair and Members. it is unfortunate that we are dedicating time and energy to this aspect of water management when our constituents and our communities are facing so many more important water challenges. Most of the U.S.. especially the Western U.S.. is suffering from drought. While 53 percent is facing moderate to exceptional drought. the entire State of California. my State. is in drought. We certainly have more fish to fry than talking about a bill that is limited to ski resorts and the Forest Service. I do urge my colleagues to worry less about these resorts and more about the drought that is ravaging our West. the wildfires that are threatening our lives and property. and climate change. which. if we continue to fail to act or accept. makes snow skiing a thing of the past. Some would say that this goes far beyond ski resort issues and affects nationwide entities. I say lets deal with the ski issue and the Forest Service separately. and lets support the Polis amendment. Madam Chair. I submit for the RECORD a letter dated February 11. 2014. from the National Ski Areas Association. In the very first sentence. they are including: I am writing on behalf of the ski industry to express the reasons ski areas strongly support passage of the bipartisan Water Rights Protection Act. H.R. 3189/S. 1630. and to advocate changes to the bill to narrow its scope. I oppose the legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and to support the Polis amendment. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130092665,"Mr. Speaker. I too rise in strong support of WRRDA and sincerely thank Chairmen SHUSTER and GIBBS and Ranking Members RAHALL and BISHOP and all the stafflets not forget themfor the great bipartisan work. We thank them for including quality provisions that are important to the Nation. especially to my district. home to Santa Fe Dam and adjacent to Whittier Narrows Dam. the two largest Corps reservoirs in L.A. county. Generally. it also improves water supply and water capture at the dam. It changes levee vegetation policy not previously taken into account. local characteristics. habitats. or safety. It allows local funding of Corps projects to benefit the region. It improves invasive species management. It prioritizes Harbor Maintenance donor regions. allowing expanded use of funding. which is something I had fought for for many years. I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks in clarifying that section 3013 of WRRDA will require the corps to perform a new review and revision of levee vegetation policy engineering technical letters. Thanks to Transportation and Infrastructure for their leadership. and please vote ""yes."" Mr. Speaker. I rise to clarify the intent of Section 3013 of the Water Resources Reform and Development Conference Report regarding Vegetation Management policy. In 2009. the Army Corps of Engineers issued new levee vegetation policy through Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 11102571. Most states and local flood control districts. including the State of California Department of Water Resources and the Los Angeles County Flood Control District. strongly disagreed with this policy as not taking into account local characteristics and good science. The 2009 ETL directed states and local agencies to remove all vegetation from their flood control levees. Our local engineers in California and Los Angeles believe this change could be damaging in the following ways: 1. It will lead to weaker levee systems since the roots of vegetation hold the levee material together. 2. It will displace the habitat for endangered and fragile species that use the vegetation. 3. It does not take into account the local geology and characteristics of our levees. 4. It will create massive costs on our flood control agencies that should be using those funds for urgent flood control projects. Section 3013 of WRRDA will solve this problem by requiring the Secretary of the Army to reissue these regulations regarding vegetation on levees and incorporate regional characteristics. habitat for species of concern. and levee performance. A minor issue has come to light in recent days since the Conference Report was filed because Section 3013 requires the Corps to reissue levee vegetation policy based off of the 2009 ETL 11102571. That 2009 ETL 11102571 was set to expire soon. so the Corps reissued a new Engineering Technical Letter ETL 11102583 that addresses the same levee vegetation policy in the last few weeks. The new ETL is very similar to the 2009 ETL and does not make the changes required by Section 3013 of WRRDA. Mr. Speaker. I would like to clarify for the record the intent of Congress that the Corps new ETL 11102583 does not satisfy the requirement of Section 3013. Section 3013 requires the Corps to revise its levee vegetation guidelines after performing a comprehensive review taking into account all regions of the United States and their unique habitats and levee structures."
1130124275,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. Congressman VALADAOs bill. H.R. 5781. the California Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014. is a northern California drought relief bill. it isnt a California drought relief act. It was introduced last week without hearings. without markups. without consultation with the House Democrats. and without any consultation or input from local water agencies. State agencies. cities. and/or tribes. This bill is being rushed to the floor without the input of critical California leaders throughout the State. It focuses primarily on providing more BayDelta water to Central Valley farmers at the expense of other users. This bill would require mandatory increases in pumping to Central Valley agriculture. which could force water managers throughout the State to cut water deliveries to southern California. to other urban water users. and. of course. to fisheries. which is a mainstay of many of the tribes in California. This could also lead to less fresh water in the delta and higher levels of salt and contamination in the water being pumped down to southern California. The White House states the President will veto this bill because ""it fails to equitably address critical elements of Californias complex water challenges."" and ""the bill appears to include a number of potentially conflictingi mandates which can cause confusion and undermine environmental laws. making it ripe for future litigation."" Senator BOXER says she opposes the bill because ""it could reignite the water wars by overriding critical State and Federal protections of all of California."" Mr. Speaker. I have some of the statements of opposition. One of them is The Sacramento Bee who has come out opposing the bill because ""any legislation affecting California water policy deserves a full hearing with input from the varied interests in northern California. the Central Valley. and the south."" Mr. Speaker. we must work in a bipartisan manner to address this drought crisis for the whole State and certainly not in secret and behind closed doors. I have introduced H.R. 5363. the Water in the 21st Century Act. and Representative HUFFMAN has introduced H.R. 4239. which would provide drought relief to all of California with its water conservation programs. its water recycling projects. its groundwater improvement operations and storm water capture solutions. including desalination and title XVI. House Democratic proposals have been excluded from this bill. H.R. 5781. There have been past attempts in past Congresses to pass certainly some proposals our legislation has proposed today. and it has failed. Mr. Speaker. I include for the RECORD statements of opposition to this bill from the White House. from Senator BOXER. The Sacramento Bee. American Rivers. the League of Conservation Voters. the Natural Resources Defense Council. the Sierra Club. the Nature Conservancy. the Pacific Fishery Management Council. the Golden Gate Salmon Association. the Golden Gate Fishermens Association. and the California Environmental Water Caucus. just to name a few. Mr. Speaker. I urge us not to pass this. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130124315,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water and Power. and I read this information in the newspaper. Nobody ever contacted me. I had no idea the formulation of this particular bill was going on. When we talk about unemployment. it is nice to trot out pictures and show what the effect is. but I see nothing in this bill that is going to help the farm workers themselves. nothing that is going to provide more wet water. create water. whether it is through recycling. desalination. or conservationall the things that southern California has been doing. Lets not forget that 80 percent of the water used is for agriculture and 20 percent is for industrial. commercial. and residential. so there is a little bit of a disparity there. my friends. I really am looking at how we move towards working on a bipartisan basis. We dont want to argue. We want to make resolutions by working together. and that is not happening. Maybe it is something that I have saidI am not sure. Mr. Speakerbut I am more than willing to sit down between now and next year when we have this bill come to the light of the day. if it is reintroduced. and we can have an honest discussion about the effects it has. Also. when we talk about Californias 35 million residents. only 12 million reside in L.A. County. part of the county that I represent. That is not including San Bernardino. Riverside. or San Diego. so we talk about the boaters in southern California getting the shaft for not getting the water and paying more for that water. When we are looking at water distribution. I suggest that we sit and actually work openly and transparently. We oppose this secretly written Central Valleyfocused legislation. We hope that we are going to continue the dialogue because. yes. California. is a donor State. We need to be able to continue providing that for the rest of the Nation. so that we can have a better economy and a growth in our agricultural area. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5781. the socalled California Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014. which should be called the CVP California Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014. and I yield back the balance of my time.

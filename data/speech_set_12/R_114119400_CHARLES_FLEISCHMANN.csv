1140020032,Mr. Speaker. Chattanooga. Tennessee. the great State of Tennessee. and our Nation lost a wonderful man last Friday. Scotty Probasco. my dear friend. passed away suddenly. All of this week. we have had memorials. tributes. eulogiesall justly deserved for this great man. I was wondering what I was going to say today as I put together these notes. but I want all of America to know about this special man and my dear friend. Scotty Probasco was born on November 26. 1928. He attended the Bright School in Chattanooga. He attended the Baylor School in Chattanooga. Dartmouth College. and then the Wharton School at Penn. He was a gifted man. a very bright man. a great businessman. but he was a giver. As I was thinking this week as to what I was going to say about Scotty. it was what did Scotty mean to me and what did Scotty mean to our community and to our Nation. Scotty was something else. He would walk into a room. and he would smile. I think of Scotty Probascos smile. Always an optimist. In our profession. sometimes you have good days and bad days. Whenever I would run into Scotty. he would smile and always encourage me. but he didnt just do that with me. he did that with everyone. As most of you all know. I proclaim Chattanooga is the greatest midsized city in America. sometimes as the greatest midsized city in the world. It is because of people like Scotty Probasco that we got there. Scotty was truly outstanding. He gave and he gave and he gave. As a community leader. whether it was the United Way or any other charity. he was always there. As a man of Christ. he was there for the First Presbyterian Church. He is survived by his loving wife. Betty. by their four children. Scott. Zane. Ellen. and Ben. and by 12 wonderful grandchildren. As I think of what our Nation needs today more than ever it is more Scotty Probascosfolks who will always accentuate the positive. who are always looking for the good in people. and who are always encouraging us to do our best. There is always a loss when we lose a friend. and there was a great loss when Chattanooga lost Scotty Probasco last week. and we all feel that. We feel that dearly. I feel that dearly. Yet. when I think of the generations to come and of the generosity. of the philanthropy. and of the kindness of Scotty Probasco and what that means to us as a people. this will be his legacy. I am going to say something to him and to his great family today: Scotty Probasco. thank you. dear friend. Thank you for a job well done. and God bless you.
1140043740,Mr. Speaker. last Thursday was a very difficult day in my beautiful hometown of Chattanooga. Tennessee. It was a day of horror. it was a day of terror. and it was a day like no other I have lived in my life. Today. I am joined in this great House by my colleagues from the Tennessee delegation. Chattanooga is my hometown. A lone gunmana terrorist. an evil mankilled five wonderful United States servicemembers. four marines and one sailor. At two locations in Chattanooga. he opened fire. There was devastation. there was death. and there was horror. and I am so deeply saddened. Before I ask Members for a moment of silence. I am going to ask this great Housethe peoples Housefor something special because. through all the carnage in the face of evil. I saw Chattanoogans come together with good. In the face of despair. I saw Chattanoogans come together with hope. I saw something in my darkest hour. I saw the greatness in America. Catholics. Protestants. Jews. Whites. Blacks. and Latinos came together. We prayed together. We hoped for better days together. We honored the men and women who serve us in all of our branches together. I feel for our great marines. I feel for our Navy in these difficult times. Let me tell you this: the Chattanooga Police Department selflessly showed up and fought this terrorist and killed him. Hamilton County police were there. While a brave sailor tried to cling to life. I saw throngs of doctors and nurses at Erlanger hospital giving their best skills to try to save this man. Sadly. they were unsuccessful. This is a day I never want to see again. I ask you that we resolve to keep all American servicemen and -women safe here on American soil. We must do that. We owe that to those five wonderful lives that we lost. all precious. I am going to ask for all of us to be Chattanooga strong. I am going to ask all of us to please come together as Americans. I will read the name of those five outstanding folks: United States Marine Gunnery Sergeant Thomas J. Sullivan. United States Marine Staff Sergeant David Allen Wyatt. United States Marine Sergeant Carson Allen Louis Holmquist. United States Marine Lance Corporal Squire Kimpton Paul Wells. and United States Navy Petty Officer Second Class Randall Smith. Mr. Speaker. I ask for a moment of silence in honor of these great Americans.
1140068083,I came to Congress. and some very creative people came to see me. We get a lot of visits up here in Congress. Folks from all over the country come to see us. I got a knock at the door one day. and there were some songwriters. They were very talented men and women. What do they do? They write and perform songs. I was just so impressed. These are creative entrepreneurs. and some of the stories are outstanding. One gentleman came to see me. and he said: One day years ago. a long time ago. I wrote a song and went in and saw the great Johnny Cash. He liked my song. and he played my song. It went well. and that was his claim to fame. Another gentleman came in. and he mentioned a song. He said: I wrote that and played it for a fellow by the name of Frank Sinatra. Now. I remember those two great performers. but these were the folks who wrote the songs. This songwriter actually got to go and hear that recorded. Sinatra invited him. and it became a classic. I was surprised to learn. as my colleague from Georgia alluded to. of the Songwriter Equity Act. but there is some fundamental unfairness involved in the process. and I wanted to talk about that. Before I came to this great House. I practiced law for about 24 years in the city of Chattanooga. I loved practicing law. but when I was not practicing law. every once in a while. the judge wanted to go fishing. and he would let me preside as special judge. I really liked presiding over cases. As a matter of fact. I probably presided over several hundred cases over my legal career. I still keep a law license. But. as a judge. what did I hear? I heard evidence many times. and I want to refer to something that is very important in this whole debate. Right now. the way that the rates are setand I want everyone who is watching this to understand thisfundamentally. the evidence cannot be considered by the judge in setting the rates for these performers. What I mean by that specifically is that these judges are not allowed by Federal law to consider sound recording royalty rates as relevant benchmarks when setting performance royalty rates for songwriters and composers. It is analogous to a judge who is hearing a case and saying: Well. I am not going to let you decide this. and that is not a good thing. These men and women come up every year. They play their songs. and they work very hard. and they want their share of the American Dream. Nashville is a great city. It is our capital city in the great State of Tennessee. and I love all of our State. I represent the Third District in east Tennessee: Chattanooga and Oak Ridge. Yet. when I travel to Nashville and when I see these men and women coming there. and there are literally hundreds of thousands of songwriters. what do they want? They want that one special song. or hopefully more. to click. for somebody to perform that. [ 1945 And when they do. they ought to be rewarded. We ought to be incentivizing this because these are creative people. these are entrepreneurs. So it is my privilege to join the distinguished gentleman from Georgia who has this Songwriter Equity Act with. I believe. all of my colleagues from Tennessee. I want the American people to take a look at this. I urge Congress to take a look at this. This shouldnt be an issue about Republican or Democrat. This is an issue about giving these songwriters a fair shake.
1140088167,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of my bill. H.R. 4820. the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. I wish to thank Chairman MCCAUL and the members of the Homeland Security Committee for all of their hard work on this bill. I will never forget the moment back in JulyI was standing on this floorwhen I was told about the shootings at two military installations in Chattanooga. Tennessee. the town in which I live and proudly represent. As many of you may remember. four marines and one sailor were killed in the attack while several others were wounded. Just this past December. following the FBI investigation. Director James Comey concluded that the shootings ""were motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda."" Given the recent attacks in Chattanooga and San Bernardino. as well as in Paris and Brussels. we need to use every tool in the toolbox to combat this new brand of extremism. This bill implements one of the key recommendations made by the Homeland Security Committees bipartisan task force. one that is specifically designed to counter terrorism and foreign fighter travel. This bill does not forbid DHS from countering all forms of extremism. but the bill does provide examples of how DHS can fulfill the requirement. such as countermessaging foreign terrorist organizations. which are actively recruiting in our country at an alarming rate. This bipartisan legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to amplify the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to fight the propaganda and the recruitment of terrorist groups like ISIS. Foreign terrorists are using technology to radicalize Americans at a troubling pace. which continues to increase. More than 250 Americans have traveled or have attempted to travel to fight with jihadists in Syria and Iraq. and the FBI says there are open counterterrorism investigations in all 50 States. mostly ISIS related. Many of these individuals were pulled in by terrorist propaganda. [ 1630 ISIS is luring Americans with empty and false promises that do not reflect the true reality on the ground in places like Syria and Iraq. The true reality centers on fear. suffering. and the murder of innocent people throughout the region and around the world. Several recent defectors from ISIS have admitted that joining the group was a terrible mistake. One young fighter said he found it very hard to live there and no longer believes the group represents their religion. We need to do all we can to amplify the messages from these disillusioned terrorists who have firsthand experience with the evil and hypocrisy of these extremist groups. The State Department and many of our key allies already utilize the testimony of those disaffected by the true reality of these terror groups. and the concept was also endorsed by the Department of Homeland Securitys Homeland Security Advisory Council last spring. Unfortunately. there may be partisan opposition to this bipartisan bill. The majority of the Homeland Security committee members. on both sides of the aisle. supported the bill in committee. I will say it again: this bill received a majority of votes from both sides of the aisle in committee. Lets not put partisanship ever ahead of our Nations security. This is a commonsense measure to hinder those recruiting efforts of groups like ISIS with the testimony of those who have seen the evil of these groups firsthand. I urge the support of my colleagues."
1140101543,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the Countering Terrorist Radicalization Act. I want to thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Chairman MCCAUL. Mr. KATKO. and Mr. LOUDERMILK for joining the legislation that I promoted and we passed in this House by a large bipartisan majority. Mr. Speaker. several weeks ago. a strong bipartisan group of Members passed my legislation. H.R. 4820. the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. It is hard to believe that almost a year has passed since the horrific shootings at two military installations in Chattanooga. Tennessee. my hometown and the town in which I proudly represent those great people in the United States House of Representatives. As many may remember. four marines and one sailor were killed in the attack while several others were wounded. Just this past December. following the FBI investigation. Director James Comey concluded that the shootings ""were motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda."" We have seen this pattern repeat in the evil attack in Orlando as well as the attacks in San Bernardino. Paris. and Brussels. We need to use every tool in our toolbox to combat Islamic extremism. The Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act section of the bill implements one key recommendation made by the Homeland Security Committees bipartisan task force specifically designed to counter terrorist and foreign fighter travel. While it doesnt forbid DHS from countering all forms of extremism. the bill does provide examples of how DHS can fulfill the requirement. such as countermessaging foreign terrorist organizations that are actively recruiting in our country at an alarming rate. This bipartisan legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to amplify testimonials of former extremists and defectors to fight the propaganda and recruitment of terrorist groups like ISIS. Foreign terrorists are using technology to radicalize Americans at a troubling pace that continues to increase. We must combat this.

Several recent defectors from ISIS have admitted that joining the group was a terrible mistake. One young fighter said that he found it very hard to live in the region and no longer believes the group represents the religion. I must state that we must do all we can to amplify the messages from these disillusioned terrorists. We are doing this with the State Department. We need to pass this bundle of bills. We need to come together. Mr. Speaker. as Americans to fight radical Islamic terrorism now. The American people deserve no less."
1140105267,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the gentleman from Minnesotas amendment. and I thank the chairman for this time. Perhaps the only thing the gentleman from Minnesota and I agree on is that this amendment is akin to his first amendment which I vigorously opposed and I asked the House to oppose. Let me reiterate. The manufactured housing industry is a great American industry. The dream of owning a home is part of the American Dream. Manufactured housing offers an opportunity to those who are less affluent to get part of that American Dream. to buy a house. Now. what has happenedand again. DoddFrank itself. a law which. if I was in this House. I would have voted against. I wasnt here then. but I have vigorously opposed since thenDoddFrank actually allows what this gentleman is trying to oppose with his amendment. So as bad as this law is. and as bad as the law that has come from this very bad law is. and this amendment is indicative of that. I want to talk about what happens when we do this. This is a miscalculation in a formula by those proponents of the rules of DoddFrank. and what it does. it scares away lenders. It scares away those who want to give credit because it opens them up to liability. Therefore. what does it do? It squeezes the poor American consumer and deprives them of the opportunity to get credit. therefore. it deprives them of the opportunity to get a home. therefore. it deprives them of a part of the American Dream. If the gentleman would listen to me. I have seen this. Who will profit? Those who are vultures. who actually have capital. who have cash. who are liquid. When these mobile homes now will not sell. there will be a glut on the market. and what will happen? They will swoop in. and those people who want to see their precious home. their first home. appreciate in value. now it will depreciate in value. and they will be harmed. This is a perfect example of government overreach. DoddFrank is a bad law. and this is an attempt to try to construe DoddFrank with CFPB rules that are detrimental to the American consumer. So do not let it hurt the American Dream. Do not let it hurt this great American industry. I respectfully urge a ""no"" vote on this gentlemans amendment."

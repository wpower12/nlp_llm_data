1140010882,Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer an amendment rooted in values that I know we all share. While we may disagree over various aspects of Federal policy in K12 education. there are important areas where we can in fact find common ground. We all believe that our children deserve an education that prepares him or her to succeed in a modern economy. We all know that far too many children dont get that chance todayparticularly children in minority and highpoverty schools. We all know that over the next 10 years. jobs in STEM fieldsscience. technology. engineering. and mathematicsare expected to grow at almost twice the rate of jobs in other fields. Today. in Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman. the unemployment rate for Hispanic residents is 60 percent higher than for their White neighbors. and it is over 110 percent higher for African Americans. Even more alarming. the poverty rate for Black families in Massachusetts is 144 percent higher than their White neighbors and 273 percent higher for Hispanics. Shockingly. those numbers are actually better than far more States across the country. While our economy is steadily improving. that gap is a dangerous economic undercurrent that. left unaddressed. will affect us all. In an increasing globalized and competitive economy. we need to ensure that we are tapping all the talent and potential that we have here in America in order to succeed. Title I funds are some of the best resources the Federal Government has to make sure that every child in every school has a fair chance at the starting line. delivering muchneeded assistance to schools that disproportionately serve minority and lowincome communities. But this bill. in its current form. would jeopardize the already inadequate resources that so many schools depend on. The Democratic substitute is a better path. It would protect those title I resources and allow them to serve their original civil rights purpose: to ensure that each of our students has an equal chance to succeed. I join my Democratic colleagues in wishing that we were not considering a bill today that would consolidate title I funds and undermine their historic role. But the amendment I offer today says that even if we are going to be living in the proposed world of cuts and block grants. STEM education and economic justice are still priorities we must elevate. My amendment would simply allow but not require States to use their flexible title I funding for grants that support the success of women. minorities. and lowincome students in STEM. Too often. Mr. Speaker. the resources our teachers need to prepare their students for jobs today and tomorrow are limited by ZIP Code. gender. and race. That makes this far more than an economic issue. It is a civil rights issue that will define our society for generations to come. I know that we all support equal access to the jobs of a modern economy. That is why we must pass this amendment. increase the reach of STEM education into communities that need it most. and ensure that a students potential isnt limited by the street that he or she grows up on. With that. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140014311,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 4 minutes. Mr. Chairman. I echo the comments of my colleagues about the importance of transparency that we have heard over the course of this debate. An open government with transparent rules and regulations is at the very core of our democracy. But I am discouraged and disappointed that we are having this debate yet again. especially on a bill that undermines science even more dramatically than last years version. When this countrys greatest minds come together to tackle our greatest problems. we are a stronger nation. Whether we are talking about achievements in cancer treatment or clean water. science makes us healthier. more innovative. and more competitive. Unfortunately. the bill we are considering today takes science off the table for the EPA. the very Agency entrusted with keeping our air clean. our water safe. and our homes clear of toxic substances. The bill before us leaves EPA with unworkable standards. prohibiting it from using certain studies simply because they include information that. by law. cannot be made public. such as peoples personal health records. My amendment does a very simple thing. It fixes that oversight by clarifying that the EPA should use the most reliable scientific information available. regardless of whether that can be publicly disclosed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the EPA relies on about 50.000 scientific studies every year. As written. H.R. 1030 would drastically shrink this number. The bill before us could even prohibit the EPA from using other governmentfunded research. like NIH studies that link toxic substances to premature births or CDC research on mitigating the impact of natural disasters on public health. Furthermore. there are several protections in place already to ensure the science the EPA uses is properly vetted and credited. First. any and all studies go through a significant peer review process. including an independent analysis. Second. Mr. Chairman. the Office of Science and Technology Policy is already working to ensure that all publicly funded research is available online. Third. public comment periods allow for anyone. an individual or organization. to submit evidence supporting or opposing a proposed regulation. However. this bill would actually put limits on the public comment period. Mr. Chairman. this legislation jeopardizes our clean air. our clean water. and the health of our families. I urge the House to accept my amendment to clarify that the EPA may use the most reliable science available. I would also like to thank my colleagues from Massachusetts. Congressman JIM MCGOVERN and KATHERINE CLARK. and the ranking member of the committee for their support of this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140065630,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank my colleague for yielding and for all of the work that he has put in on an important and necessary advancement in our education system. As he mentioned. the rule we are debating today also incorporates a rule for an energy bill that I wanted to address today because nowhere is the need for a comprehensive energy policy more critical than in my home State of Massachusetts and the entire region of New England. With recent announced closures of two plants in our region. one coal and one nuclear. we are facing the loss of over 2.000 megawatts of an already antiquated. already overtaxed electric grid. That loss of capacity is already causing the bills of our consumers to skyrocket through a quadrupling of our capacity rates. from $1 billion to over $4 billion. Those closures and subsequent rate increases underscore our need for a roadmap that puts us on a path toward renewable energy while balancing the reliability and affordability. The bill before us today does exactly the opposite. It reverses course and renews our investment in outdated energy resources while putting up roadblocks that will halt the innovation our energy infrastructure so desperately needs. In particular. I am very concerned with section 1110 of the bill. which would require regional grid operators to conduct a reliability analysis each time a rate change is filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Unfortunately. reliability comes at a cost. and the analysis required by section 1110 fails to even consider its impact on ratepayers. It ignores the concerns that I hear across my district every single day. Rate increases mean families cant save. businesses cant grow. local towns cant plan for the future. That is why I introduced an amendment which would simply add ""at the lowest possible cost"" to the reliability analysis in section 1110. Unfortunately. it was not made in order. It was a simple amendment that would have given muchneeded direction and flexibility to each regional operator to determine what its reliability needs are and how much it is going to cost local ratepayers. The reliability analysis is a clear benefit to fuel types that can be stored and ignores the realities and benefits of other sources of energy. including renewables. The criteria required in this analysis fails to consider regional disparities. such as natural gas resources. local policies. and infrastructure. If the majority is going to insist on a reliability analysis. at the very least we should consider the impact the analysis would have on energy costs to our constituents. To say I am disappointed about what this bill has become would be a tremendous understatement. I hope todays vote will send a signal to the majority that this version does not have a viable pathway forward and that our Caucus remains committed to working with them on a bill that does."
1140081352,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the House for allowing me to discuss the Fair RATES Act. H.R. 2984. and for bringing it to the floor for a vote. I also thank Chairman WHITFIELD. Chairman UPTON. Ranking Members RUSH and PALLONE. as well as the committee staffs on both sides. for their work with our office to help this bill move forward. In particular. to echo Chairman WHITFIELDs comments. he has been an incredible partner with us as we have tried to move this bill forward. and I am truly grateful for his assistance in doing so. Mr. Speaker. every year regulators in New England hold energy capacity auctions to ensure that we have sufficient energy that is generated to meet consumer demand. Two years ago. during an auction. there was a shortfall that triggered administrative pricing at triple the current capacity payments. skyrocketing from about $1 billion to $3 billion. That rate increase hasnt even reached our constituents yet. and our region already pays the highest energy rates in the continental United States. Next June. a significant portion of their bills will triple due to that auction. When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviewed the rate increase. it was down to four commissioners and it deadlocked 22. One Democratic Commissioner and one Republican Commissioner raised concerns about whether those rates were just and reasonable for consumers. However. the rates took effect by operation of law without any action from FERC. and because there was no official decision by FERC. there was no decision to appeal. holding our constituents voiceless. Another annual auction just took place last month with rates. again. that were three times higher than they are today. Those rates are. again. being reviewed by a shorthanded FERC. which sets up the potential for the exact same outcome of consumers. once again. being shut out of the process. With bipartisan support and endorsements from the American Public Power Association. the New England Public Power Association. the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. my bill. the Fair RATES Act. would simply ensure that avenues of good governance remain open. It provides that if at any time rate changes take effect by operation of law without Commission action. deadlocked or otherwise. aggrieved parties retain the right to protest those rates through the process that is outlined by the Federal Power Act. I am the first to admit that this is a complex issue. but my bill is a simple fix to a complex problem. When we as lawmakers identify a flaw in one of our laws. especially one that unduly harms our constituents. it is our obligation to act to amend the law. The unpredictability of my regions energy rates means families cant save for the future and local businesses cant grow. The least we can do is to ensure that they will never be held voiceless when their electric bills arrive at the end of each month. so I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker. I also want to give particular thanks to the committee staffs on both the majority and minority sides. including Patrick Currier. Allison Trexler. Rick Kessler. Caitlin Haberman. and Alexander Ratner. Finally. I have to acknowledge somebody on my own team. Eric Fins. who knows more about energy rates and capacity markets than he ever thought he would. and I am grateful for that. He is now writing a law school essay on the topic. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140085558,I thank Congressman JOHNSON. I am honored to be here with the gentleman. and I thank him for his leadership on this important issue. I thank. of course. Ranking Member CONYERS. who has for so long been a guiding light in our party on issues of justice. Congressman. you and Mr. CONYERS together have been this Chambers champions on civil rights and equality in our justice system. You are. once again. leading the fight as we call for reforms to an unjust and unequal arbitration system. I am grateful. and I thank you for your leadership. Mr. Speaker. at the foundation of our democracy is one simple promise: no matter who you are or where you come from or what you have done. you will be seen as equal before the law. Thomas Jefferson. himself. wrote centuries ago: The most sacred duties of government is to do equal and impartial justice to all citizens. Forced arbitration. Mr. Speaker. is an affront to that dutya manipulation of the justice system that tips our scales in the direction of influence. money. and power. It removes even the slightest veneer of fair treatment in cases ranging from sexual harassment and discrimination to loss of housing and shelter. to neglect and abuse inside substance abuse treatment centers and retirement homes. When a plaintiff sits at an arbitration table across from a powerful corporation to challenge a fraudulent charge or to question its practices. the protections that we have spent centuries instilling in our justice system get washed away. There is no judge. no jury. no avenue for appeal. There is no justice at that table. At the very moment you need to access our courtrooms most. you find yourself locked out. diverted to a room outside the scope of our judicial system and beyond the bounds of our laws. Without your choice or sometimes even knowledge. forced arbitration transforms a level playing field into an uphill climb. At that point. most Americans turn around. but for the few who muster the will or the resources to continue their cases. there is no guarantee to counsel. forcing them to face off against some of the most experienced legal minds in our country completely on their own. The Arbitration Fairness Act would help remedy this profound shortcoming in our justice system and ensure that equal access to legal protection doesnt come along with a price tag. Mr. Speaker. that is one of the most fundamental promises we make in our country. I am grateful to Mr. JOHNSON for his leadership on the issue.
1140090584,"Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Mr. PALLONE for yielding. for his leadership on this issue throughout his time on Energy and Commerce. particularly over the last several months since I have been on the committee trying to galvanize support from all of our colleagues to recognize the impact that this is having every single day. Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for including H.R. 4641 in this package of bipartisan opioidrelated bills. None of our districts has been spared the heartbreaking headlines about lives lost to the opioid crisis. We have heard from each of our constituents who have attended funerals for friends. neighbors. classmates. colleagues. and family members. The bills we are considering this week are a promising step forward as we find ways to respond to this crisis. To my colleague. Congresswoman BROOKS. thank you for your partnership on this issue and on so many others. We have both seen firsthand how lack of access to treatment can lead those suffering from addiction to our courts. With this bill. we are trying to change the course of their path to stop addiction before it even begins. Mr. Chairman. last week the Boston Globe wrote a series of articles about the opioid crisis in my home State of Massachusetts. The statistics are devastating. Nationally. heroin overdose rates have tripled in the last 5 years. At home. our State faces a heroin overdose rate that is twice the national average. Last year alone. nearly 1.400 Massachusetts families lost loved ones to opioid overdoses. Between 2013 and 2014. prescription opioid overdoses nearly doubled. During that same time. the number of people in Massachusetts who overdosed on a combination of heroin and prescription opioids rose by almost 500 percent. The Globe also noted that there has been a noticeable shift from opioids to heroin with one exception. Bristol County. where many of my constituents live. In trying to explain that exception. the reporter included a haunting line that has stayed with me ever since. He wrote that. in Bristol County. ""prescription opioids remain a dominant killer. though its not clear whether thats because this area is somehow less susceptible to heroin or if its merely a matter of time."" Mr. Chairman. we cannot accept a reality with a rise in heroin overdoses as ""merely a matter of time."" We have all said it over 100 times. When it comes to a Federal response. there is no silver bullet. But H.R. 4641 tries to focus on what I believe offers us one of the very best opportunities for combating this problem: stopping addiction before it ever starts. The bill will create a new task force dedicated to the job of reviewing. modifying. and updating best practices for the management of pain and the prescription of pain medication. Voices from HHS. the VA. FDA. DEA. NIH. and other agencies will join prescribers. substance use disorder professionals. patients suffering from chronic pain. and patients who have lived through the heartbreaking reality of becoming addicted to prescription pills. These advocates and experts are on the front lines of this fight every single day. Under their guidance. this task force will ensure we implement the policies that balance responsible pain management with the urgency that our opioid crisis requires. Again. I am encouraged by the bipartisan progress we are making on this issue. yet. our work is just beginning. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and look forward to working with each of them to build on this momentum."
1140099951,"Mr. Speaker. regardless of our party affiliation or our congressional district. we are all mourning the senseless violence and loss of life in Orlando. As we learn the names and the stories of each victim. our focus now turns to how we respond. how we prevent another act of terror and hate. another tragedy to which this country has become far too accustomed. We face a multitude of shortcomings that this Nation must account for: access to guns designed to maximize death and destruction as well as the very real threat that violent extremism and homegrown terrorism pose to American lives. Two debates. it is worth noting. that this body has repeatedly failed to take up. In the days and weeks ahead. these issues deserve and demand our attention. But as we wrestle with the means by which terror was expressed. we cannot ignore the specific target it sought: the LGBT community. We often use words like ""indiscriminate"" when we talk about gun violence. referring to the terrifying randomness these tragedies can reflect. the sense that it could happen anywhere. anytime. to any of us. We cannot use the term ""indiscriminate"" here. While the details are still coming to light. all signs point to a crime motivated by hateful prejudice against a specific subset of our population. It comes at a particularly difficult time. This month is LGBT Pride Month. 30 days to celebrate what it means to be an LGBT American. to be true to yourself. to remember the blood. sweat. and tears that activists and advocates have shed for generations demanding better of their country. On Saturday afternoon. I walked through the streets of Boston for our Commonwealths annual Pride Parade. It is one of my favorite events of the yearthe celebration. jubilation. camaraderie. and energy that takes the city by storm. The first year I participated. I had the honor of marching with my predecessor. Congressman Barney Frank. The year after that. I walked with my former college roommate. Jason Collins. who had recently come out as the first gay professional athlete in a major U.S. sport. Standing next to Congressman Frank and Jason. I saw not only what their presence meant to that sea of supporters surrounding us. but what those supporters mean to them: an incredible wave of love and acceptance that they had to fight a lifetime to seea statement of support from community and country that most of us get to take for granted. This past Saturday was no different. Love and tolerance emanated from every sidewalk. every storefront. and every street. Yet less than 24 hours later. we woke up on Sunday to the devastating images of the Pulse nightclub: families and friends searching for loved ones. heroes carrying injured victims in their arms to a nearby hospital. strangers waiting in line for hours to donate blood. a community far too accustomed to violence and hate forced to confront a painful truththat for all of our recent strides and successes. this country continues to give discrimination against the LGBT community a home. While this body stands firmly united in heartbreak and horror over what transpired on Sunday morning. we cannot ignore the example that our actionsor inactionshave helped set. Our Nation was founded on a sacred promise of equal treatment under the law. yet. even today. we still fall short. When we allow some Americans to be fired from their job because of who they love. when we deny access to public accommodations because of who you are. when we fail to end legalized discrimination in businesses and hospitals and homeless shelters. when we set policies that treat an entire community as less worthy of our protection. then we cannot be surprised when that prejudice takes root across the country and rears its head with gruesome. gutwrenching consequences. Bigotry begets violence. This is a lesson our country has learned time after time at tremendous human cost. Today. if we are serious about responding to hate. then we have to dismantle the policies within our Federal Government that give it cover."
1140108749,Madam Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for being such a strong voice on womens rights in this country. Colleagues. yesterday. this body considered a bill that would codify discrimination against our Nations LGBT community under the guise of religious freedom. Today. we are debating legislation that would similarly distort this countrys sacred promise of religious liberty and use it as a vehicle to deny women access to health care. Make no mistake. the ability to freely and fully practice your faith is a fundamental bedrock American liberty. But to ensure that liberty for all of us. our Constitution establishes a simple boundary. One persons sincerely held beliefs cannot trump anothers. My freedoms and rights cannot be used to limit yours. And in this country. access to abortion is a right. as our Justices have ruled time and again. So lets be clear. This bill is not about protecting religious freedom of an employer or insurer. It is about imposing the religious views of a few on the healthcare choices of the many. And this bill is not about protecting womens health. Instead. it will create dangerous. discriminatory barriers to access to care for women and their families. Those who oppose abortion are free to exercise that belief fully in their personal lives. That is the promise that our country makes to each of us. But nowhere does this country promise that your government will be the vehicle through which your beliefs are imposed on someone elseyour neighbor. your coworker. your employer. or your friend. Nowhere do we say that my faith is more legitimate than yours or that your religious principles outweigh my access to basic civil rights. In fact. the Constitution expressly prohibits that sort of system in the very first words of the very First Amendment. Since those words were written. the everchanging. often elusive balance between religious freedom and civil rights in this country has been fought for every single day throughout our history. Passing this bill is an affront to those honest efforts and to the vast majority of Americans who value both their faith and their freedoms.

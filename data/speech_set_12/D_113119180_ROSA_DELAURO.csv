1130001048,"Madam Chair. I rise in strong and vociferous opposition to what I view as a misguided amendment. It aims to cut funding that would help repair the seawalls and research buildings damaged by Superstorm Sandy at the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge in Connecticut. This is a vindictive amendment. in my view. that needlessly slashes disaster relief for one particular State. and I urge its defeat. Named after the former Republican Congressman from my State. the Stewart McKinney Wildlife Refugee spans 70 miles of Connecticut shoreline. including 800 acres of island habitats. a beach. and tidal wetlands. One of the more remarkable aspects of the McKinney Refuge is a chain of seven islands along the coast. The islands support habitat for several federally endangered and threatened species and also hosts related research facilities. These islands are key stops for birds migrating along the Atlantic Flyway. and two of them have been named ""important bird areas"" by the National Audubon Society. Some of these islands are also in close proximity to urban centers. All of them sustained severe damage during Superstorm Sandy. For example. the storm damaged the dock. seawall. and education building on the Outer Island research station. which is also the most visited island within the McKinney Refuge. As a result. the natural resources on Outer Island cannot currently be properly managed. On Outer Island. the lack of repairs will have serious environmental consequences. If the seawall isnt repaired. erosion will undermine the foundation of the main building. dislodge the septic tank and cause significant contamination. and will lead to major repair costs. Thats why we need to make available disaster aid to the McKinney Refuge so that they can recover from this storm. just as we have many times in the past for other refuges affected by disasters all across this country. Let me give you some examples. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008. we appropriated $71 million for wildlife refuges in Texas. $20 million in Mississippi. and $74 million for refuges in Louisiana. the sponsor of this amendments home State. One of the central responsibilities of this institution is to act on behalf of the American people whenever a major disaster occurs. Federal disaster relief is meant to restore homes. businesses. communities. and Federal facilities to their predisaster condition. We do this whether the disaster is a fire in the west. a tornado in the south. or a hurricane in the northeast. There is no good reason to make an exception of the McKinney Refuge here. The sponsor of this amendment. Congressman FLEMING of Louisiana. has argued that this bill includes $9.8 million solely to repair the damage done at the Outer Island. This is simply not true. The Fish and Wildlife Service requested over $10.9 million for repairs to the McKinney Refuge. including just over $2 million for Outer Island. The rest of the funds. however. would support repairs all along the 70 miles of affected Connecticut coast. By cutting the funding needed to rebuild the Connecticut coastline to its preSandy condition. this amendment prevents the McKinney Refuge from meeting its Federal commitment to conserve wildlife. to provide education and outdoor recreation for the public. and it unfairly singles out Connecticut and all of the protected wildlife along our shores. Is the State and refuge somehow unworthy of Federal support? Its a terrible precedent for disaster aid. When these disasters occur. we have always come together as a Nation of Americans. just as we did after Katrina and Andrew and Irene. and we should not change that now. I urge my colleagues to reject what I view as a pernicious amendment and help Connecticuts McKinney Refuge rebuild from this storm."
1130028285,"Thank you so much. Its an honor to join with you. I know where your heart. your head and your courage lie with regard to this issue. And we applaud you for your efforts with regard to the one caucus around this place that says that our goal and our mission is to make sure that people who are poor today. let us help them move out of that being poor. Let us help them move into the middle class. because in fact they do want to work. they do want to take care of their families. Theyre not just statistics. They are people to be upheld and respected and not to be vilified in so many ways as they are there. So I congratulate you and your efforts. Im proud to be here with you tonight and with my colleague. Congressman ELLISON. and the Progressive Caucus for his comments and remarks. I see that we are also joined by our colleague. Mr. JOHNSON. I want to thank you for your efforts as well. As youre talking about. what tonight is all about is highlighting severe immoral cuts that are made to antihunger and nutrition programs. particularly the food stamp program. And that is coming from the House of Representatives in the farm bill that passed out of committee. Everybody knows millions of families are struggling in this economy. Across this country. nearly 15 percent of American households were food insecure in 2010. Nearly 50 million Americansover 60 million childrenare struggling with hunger right now. It is about children. it is about the disabled. it is about seniors. And this is a problem all across this land. My State of Connecticut. in my districtConnecticut statistically is the richest State in the Nation because we have Fairfield County. and some parts of the State are known as the Gold Coast. with very affluent people. But we have such pockets of hunger that. in my district. one out of seven is food insecure. Im tired of the commentary on food insecurity. What that meansand my colleague knows this. weve talked about thisit is about being hungry. These folks. one out of seven doesnt know where their next meal is coming from. In Mississippi. 24.5 percent suffer food hardship. nearly one in four people. West Virginia and Kentucky. that drops to just over 22 percent. one in five. In Ohio. nearly 20 percent. California. just over 19 percent. The estimates of Americans at risk of going hungry here in this land of plenty are appalling. And at times such as this. our key Federal food security programs become all the more important. This is especially true of food stamps. our countrys most important effort to deal with hunger here at home and to ensure that American families can put food on the table for their kids. Right now. food stamps are helping over 47 million Americansnearly half of them childrento meet their basic food needs. They make a tremendous difference for the health and the wellbeing of families. as our colleague. Mr. ELLISON. pointed out with his examples. Food stamps have been proven to improve lowincome childrens health. their development. reduced food insecurity. and have a continuing positive influence into adulthood. You know. I listen to people that talk about waste. fraud. abuse. Food stamps always has one of the lowest error rates of any government program. Go to the IRS. go to Defense. go to a crop insurance program. and you will find waste. fraud. and abuse. Food stamps are good for the economy. Economists agree that food stamps have a powerful. positive impact on economic growth. Last month. Bloomberg ran an article called. ""Best Stimulus Package May Be Food Stamps."" because they get resources into the hands of families who are going to spend those dollars right away. Most importantly. food stamps are the right thing to do. Ninetynine percent of food stamp recipients have incomes below the poverty line. It is the job of good government to help vulnerable families get back on their feet. In the words of Harry Truman: Nothing is more important in our national life than the welfare of our children. and proper nourishment comes first in attaining this welfare. This is something that everyone in Washington used to agree on. In the past. theres been a strong tradition of bipartisanship on hunger and nutrition. From the left. leaders like George McGovern. and from the right. leaders like Bob Dole. came together. They made a difference for families who were in need. Over the past 30 years. policies aimed at debt and deficit reduction to keep programs that help the most vulnerable among us to get by have always been protected on a bipartisan basis from deep cuts. But the farm bill coming out of the House right now seeks to destroy that tradition. In the name of deficit reduction. the bill slashes food stamps by more than $20 billion. hurting millions of Americans in our economy. By eliminating categorical eligibility. their bill would force up to 2 million lowincome Americans to go hungry. Their bill kicks 210.000 lowincome children from the free school lunch program. It changes the relationship between SNAP and LIHEAP to take benefits from more lowincome Americansmostly seniors and working families with kids. Lets be clear: this has nothing to do with deficit reduction and everything to do with the ideological priorities of a House majority. Ever since the Speaker took the gavel. this majority has tried to slash through the most crucial threads of our American social safety net. Their Ryan budget cut over $130 billion from food stamps. mostly by converting it to an inadequate block grant. Last year. when the House Ag Committee had to identify $33 billion in 10year savings from the programs of their jurisdiction. they singled out food stamps for all of the cutsnot direct payments. not crop insurancejust food stamps for the entire cut. This is terrible policy. It will cause hunger and more health problems. These cuts are lopsided and are a dereliction of our responsibility to the American people. and of our moral responsibility. Let me quote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. They said last year: We must form a ""circle of protection"" around programs that serve the poor and the vulnerable in our Nation and throughout the world. And as Catholic leaders wrote last month: Congress should support access to adequate and nutritious food for those in need and oppose attempts to weaken or restructure these programs that would result in reduced benefits to hungry people. The House farm bill does the opposite. It jeopardizes the growth and development of our children. it jeopardizes seniors. and it puts at risk those disabled Americans. In my district yesterday. I went to the Cornerstone Christian Church in Milford. Connecticut. and the representatives there were the woman who volunteers in their food bank program. Reverend Stackhouse of the Church of the Redeemer. Lucy Nolan of End Hunger Connecticut. Nancy Carrington. who heads up the Connecticut Food Bank. and a young woman whose name was Penny. She had worked all of her adult life. She lost her job. She thought it was going to be easy to get another job and to be able to make her mortgage payments and all of the other financial obligations that she had. In the midst of this financial crisis. she and her husband separated. putting the burden of the family on her shoulders. She didnt know where to turn. She didnt know how she was going to put food on the table. She went to the Connecticut food bank. They helped her to be able to access the food stamp program. Thats where she is nowstill looking for a job. still wanting to work. Her pride enables her to continue to look for that job. The courage of speaking before this group yesterday and the press. and to tell that story. took great couragelike so many others are telling that story. my colleagues tonight. We do have an obligation. These are not statistics that we are talking about. These are flesh and blood Americans who are looking for a bridge. They dont want to be there forever. They want to be able to take care of themselves and their families. Its a genius of the food stamp program to say in times of need: were there and. yes. we rise in the participation. When it gets better economically. those numbers drop. We have an obligation to those peoplenot to the statistics. but to those individuals who look to the Federal Government that says in a time of challenge: give me a little help. thats all Im asking. I dont want everything. I know you dont have all those resources. Help me in this hour of need. Thats what where our moral responsibility is. Again. I say thank you to my colleagues for participating and for your steadfastness in dealing with this issue."
1130031543,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think its very interesting that the Food Safety Modernization Act was passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee. which has jurisdiction. as well as the FDA. and. quite frankly. it does not have any jurisdiction under this piece of legislation. and Im disappointed that it made it through the Rules Committee. However. in January 2011. the President signed a transformative food safety law that Congress had passed in a bipartisan manner to improve the health of our constituents. The legislation was supported by a broad coalition of consumer. public health. and industry groups. groups including the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the National Restaurant Association. When we crafted the final food safety bill. we struck a compromise. a compromise on the scope of the bill so that the vast majority of truly small farms and processors are excluded. including those that sell most of their food directly to the public through farmers markets and farm stands. in addition to which regional considerations were also taken into consideration. The integrity of that compromise has been maintained in the proposals released by the FDA to date. I can speak to this compromise and the agreement we reached at the time because. in fact. I helped to craft and negotiate the final language. The law also requires that the FDA take regional differences into account when crafting its proposed rules. Let us be clear: that legislation was needed. Foodborne illness remains a threat to the public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control. each year 48 million Americans become sick from the very food they eat. 128.000 are hospitalized. and 3.000 die. These figures are far too high and simply unacceptable. so we acted. We passed the first major improvement to the FDAs food safety laws in more than 70 years. Under the guise of seeking a report. this amendment seeks to further slow down the implementation of the law. a law with the potential to improve the very health of our constituents by reducing their risk of becoming sick from food. Yet nowhere in the text of this amendment or in the intent of these reports do I see a mention of the public health or consumer safety. All of the FDAs proposals to implement this critical law already go through the official rulemaking process. meaning that the agency must consider the costs and the benefit of the rules. and that every one of us and our constituents can weigh in and submit comments on the rules already. The amendment before us now simply intends to slow down the process of implementing the law. Rather than working to obstruct and delay implementation. we should be working to encourage strong implementation. Lets look at what has happened since the bill was signed into law. In that short period of time. there have been almost 20 multiState outbreaks positively linked to food products regulated by the FDA. One of those was an outbreak of listeria associated with cantaloupe. a product that had not previously been identified as associated with that dangerous pathogen. The same outbreak killed 33 Americans. the largest number of Americans lost to a single outbreak in a quarter of a century. Right now there is a multiState outbreak of hepatitis A that may have been caused by a contaminated product regulated by the FDA. More than 115 people in eight States have become ill. and more than 50 of them have required hospitalization. It continues to be supported by the majority of Americans. A recent poll showed that more than 75 percent of Americans surveyed supported the food safety law. which is why so many respected organizations that work to improve the public health. including the Consumer Federation of America. Center for Science in the Public Interest. Pew Charitable Trusts. and Consumer Unions. oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to heed their advice and oppose this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130040256,Mr. Chairman. my amendment would prohibit funds in this bill from being used by the Defense Department to train the Afghan Special Mission Wing to operate or maintain Russianmade Mi17 helicopters. Over 93.000 people have died in a tragic war in Syria that is being fueled by Russian arms being supplied to the Assad regime. Over 1.6 million Syrian refugees are now hosted across five countries. By the end of the year. half the population of Syria will be in need of aid. We know for a fact that the Russian arms manufacturer. Rosoboronexport. is arming Syria. The Syrian Army requested 20.000 Kalashnikov assault rifles. 20 million rounds of ammunition. machine guns. grenade launchers. grenades. and sniper rifles with nightvision sights. And Russia also recently announced it would provide Assad with advanced S300 missile defense batteries. Yet. our Defense Department continues to channel business to this Russian arms manufacturer. DOD recently skirted around a prohibition on purchasing Mi17 helicopters from Russias state arms dealer in last years Defense appropriations bill. signing a contract with Rosoboronexport to procure 30 Mi17s for the Afghan Specialty Mission Wing using 2012 Afghanistan Security Forces Fund moneys. This contract signing. flying in the face of congressional intent. incredibly came just days after this House voted 4230 to strengthen the prohibition on Pentagon business with the Russian arms dealera prohibition also included in this Defense appropriations bill. Even more egregious. it also came on the heels of a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction that recommended suspension of the plans to purchase these helicopters for the Afghan Special Mission Wing as the Afghans do not even have the capacity to use them. The Defense Department touts the 30 years of experience the Afghans have with the Mi17 helicopters as a key reason to purchase them. yet we are still trying to train them to fly these helicopters instead of Americanmade helicopterstraining that the Inspector General report says has been slow and uneven. The report also argues that moving forward with the acquisition of these Mi17 helicopters is highly imprudent until. among other things. an agreement is reached on NATOs Afghanistan Training Mission concept for reorganization within the Afghan Government to support this Special Mission Wing. Mr. Chairman. U.S. taxpayers should not be subsidizing the Russian state arms dealer that is fueling the war in Syria. The language already included in this bill states this. We should also not be spending money to train an Afghan unit to fly these Russian helicopters. particularly when the Inspector General has raised serious questions about the content of that units capabilities. I urge support for my amendment. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1130064693,"I want to say thank you to my colleague from Wisconsin and thank you for all of your efforts and what you have been doing. It is an honor for me to serve with you. At the heart of soul of what your interests are all about is what that chart reflects. It is about people who are making the minimum wage. What is their life about? What are we doing in terms of the policies that we create in this institution. which is an institution which historically has been about providing opportunity? A drop in the minimum wage is not an opportunity for future success. Your characterization of the TransPacific Partnership in creating this kind of an effort is absolutely on target. In terms of this agreement. next week. as you know. the trade ministers from 12 nations are going to meet in Singapore. As U.S. trade negotiators continue to push for this partnership. the TPP agreement. they want to push to move it so that we can do something by the end of this year. You made a point before that this could have been a new opportunity. It represented an effort to create something that was new. a sustainable model that promoted economic development with shared prosperity. But. as you know. unfortunately the talks have gone down the same road as previous trade agreements: export of more jobs. not more goods. unsafe imports. and threats to the public health. among other things. You made that clear. The country lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs. millions of service sector jobs since the North American Free Trade Agreement. which I will tell my colleague that I was proud to vote against when that came before this body. and the World Trade Organization. Both of those went into effect. and we have seen the loss of more than 5 million jobs. Again. your point is well stated. Wages in the United States have decreased and economic inequality is something that is talked about a lot today. It is not an abstract concept. It is not an abstract construct. It is the result of public policy that has fostered economic inequality in the United States. and that has increased as a result of these past trade agreements. The recent trade agreement with Korea reinforced why we cannot continue to do more of the same. In its first year. U.S. exports to Korea dropped 10 percent as imports from Korea increased. The trade deficit with Korea exploded by 37 percent in just 1 year. which equates to a net loss of approximately 40.000 more U.S. jobs. Why in an economy that is so difficult for people today are we embarking on public policy initiatives that increase lost jobs. lost wages. more economic uncertainty. and insecurity for families in the United States? It is wrongheaded. There is no reason to believe that the TransPacific Partnership deal will not be the same kind of a raw deal for U.S. workers and more as this agreement would be unprecedented in scope. The President himself has commented that the pact would establish rules that extend far beyond traditional trade matters to include ""a whole range of new trade issues that are going to be coming up in the future: innovation. regulatory convergence. how we are thinking about the Internet and intellectual property."" The agreement will create binding policies on future Congresses in numerous areas to include those that are related to labor. patent and copyright. land use. food. agriculture and product standards. natural resources. the environment. stateowned enterprises. and government procurement policies. as well as financial. health care. energy. telecommunications. and other service sector regulations. This is a treaty that goes beyond tariffs. The scope is. as I have outlined. unbelievable. We also know that the lack of transparency on this treaty is unbelievable. It is interesting to note that industry has had great access to the process and what is going on. Members of Congress. both sides of the aisle. have not had that same access to the information in this trade agreement. and it is our constitutional authority as Members of Congress to approve trade agreements. We cannot be frozen out any longer. We are not going to tolerate that. We know. for example. that the agreement will likely lead to increases in U.S. imports of shrimp and other seafood from Vietnam and Malaysia. Here is something I believe my colleague knows but others need to know: In 2012. imported seafood products from Vietnam were refused entry 206 times because of contamination concerns while some exporters in Malaysia have acted as a conduit to transit Chinese shrimp to the United States in order to circumvent both FDA import alerts and antidumping duties. When I said they had been stopped. why have they been stopped? Filthy product. contaminated product. antibioticlaced product putting in jeopardy the public health of people in the United States. And rather than improving food safety enforcement and regulations in partner nations. the agreement may lead to a drain of resources needed to ensure that food safety at agencies like the FDA are called in to resolve these disputes with other countries. The agreement may even undermine critical U.S. food safety regulations. We also know from the recently leaked text that U.S. trade negotiatorsI say ""recently leaked"" because we dont have access to the information. We are not able to come in and have people lay it out for us. We now know from the leaked text that U.S. trade negotiators are proposing unbalanced intellectual property provisions that are going to hinder our trading partners access to safe and more affordable drugs. This is not only going to raise the price of medicines overseas. preventing millions from getting the medical care that they need. but it limits the ability of United States companies exporting these drugs to grow internationally and to generate more jobs at home. Incredibly. even as the administration is proposing to lower drug costs for consumers here in the United States by proposing in its budget to modify the length of exclusivity on brand name biologics from 12 to 7 years. our trade negotiators are demanding 12 years of data exclusivity from our trading partners. denying their people quicker access to more affordable drugs. How can the United States be in that business? It is morally unacceptable that people overseas will have less access to lifesaving drugs. That is not who we are as a Nation. That is not where our values lie. These and other critical areas are being negotiated without sufficient congressional consultation. even though. as I mentioned. under the Constitution. the Congress. not the Executive. has the exclusive constitutional authority to ""regulate commerce with foreign nations"" and write the Nations laws. Over the last few decades. Presidents have increasingly taken over both of those powers through a mechanism known as ""fast track."" What it does is erode Congress ability to shape the content of the free trade agreement. which today. as I said again earlier. clearly goes well beyond tariff issues of the shaping of the trade agreement. but it then becomesif you provide for fast track authority. then that means it comes to this body. My colleague from Wisconsin knows this. He served in legislative bodies. We will have no ability to amend. and you just come and you rubberstamp it. No more. No more. Under the recent iteration of fast trackwhich expired. by the way. in 2007U.S. trade negotiations required various stages of congressional consultation before and during the negotiations. But even that minimal level of congressional consultation has not occurred with regard to the TransPacific Partnership treaty. which is why myself and so many of my other colleagues from both sides of the aisle. including my colleague from Wisconsin"
1130071640,"First. let me say thank you to my colleagues who are leaving the floor for your great work on the issue of wage stagnation and the inability for upward mobility for people in this Nation. You have done a great service here tonight with laying out what the facts are. What we need to do is to be able to increase peoples income and. therefore. give them the economic wherewithal to take care of themselves and their families and have a road to economic security. So I thank you very. very much. I also want to say a thank you to my colleague from Rhode Island. Congressman CICILLINE. who will join me in this 30minute Special Order for tonight. Tonight. I want to talk about the severe and immoral cuts being made to antihunger and nutrition programs. and particularly the continuation of devastating food stamp cuts being made in the proposed conference farm bill. We have said here that food stampsfood stampsare an economic safety net. As written. the farm bill would force 850.000 households1.7 million men. women. children and veterans across Americato go hungry. even while wealthy agribusinesses continue to get generous crop subsidies. Lowincome seniors. working poor families with children. and individuals with disabilities would be particularly impacted by the cruel cuts in this bill. Meanwhile. the conference has decided to reopen the loopholes that the House of Representatives. in a bipartisan way. closed. and those loopholes as they reopen them will make sure that millionaires and billionaires are getting crop subsidies. One has to ask the question. Who are we working for here? In effect. this is reverse Robin Hood legislation. It steals food from the poor to help pay crop subsidies to the rich. And when I see Members supporting the immoral cuts in this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I have to wonder if some people in this institution have really lost their perspective and understand why we are here and what our moral responsibility is. Across this countrythis great countrynearly 50 million Americans. including over 16 million children. are struggling with hunger right now. Think for a moment about what that means. In 1974. a writer at Time magazine explained it this way: The victim of starvation burns up his own body fats. muscles and tissues for fuel. His body quite literally consumes itself and deteriorates rapidly. The kidneys. liver and endocrine system often cease to function properly. A shortage of carbohydrates. which play a vital role in brain chemistry. affects the mind. Lassitude and confusion set in. so that starvation victims often seem unaware of their plight. That is what we are talking about here. Hunger is agonizing. It is a curse. We are talking about men and women experiencing real physical torment. children who cannot concentrate in school because all they can think about is food. Seniors are forced to decide. in this virulent winter season. this polar vortex that we talked about. whether or not they will go hungry or whether or not they will go cold. This is a problem all across this land. The estimates of Americans at risk of going hungry. here in the land of plenty. are appalling. In my Connecticut district. nearly one in seven households is not sure if they can afford enough food to feed their families. In Mississippi. 24.5 percent suffer food hardship. That is nearly one in four people. In West Virginia and Kentucky. 22 percent. one in five people. suffer food hardship. in Ohio. nearly 20 percent. and in California. just over 19 percent. The continued existence of hunger in America is a disgrace and. quite frankly. an indictment of this institution. As the late Senator George McGovern. a champion against hunger. wrote: The Earth has enough knowledge and resources to eradicate this ancient scourge. Hunger has plagued the world for thousands of years. But ending it is a great moral imperative now more than ever before. because for the first time humanity has the instruments at hand to defeat this cruel enemy at a very reasonable cost. We have the ability to provide food for all within the next three decades. Or as President John F. Kennedy put it: We have the ability. we have the means. and we have the capacity to eliminate hunger from the face of the Earth. We need only the will. Mr. Speaker. that will seems to be lacking in the Congress right now. Instead of working to end hunger for good. this farm bill takes food from the plates of 1.7 million Americans. And again. we are talking about seniors. veterans. children. families who are playing by the rules and many of whom are working fulltime. all the time. The farm bill. this one that is being proposed. would force Americans to go hungry. And at the same time. the conference has chosen. against the will of the House and the Senate. to reopen loopholes and strip out payment limits so that millionaires and wealthy agribusinesses can continue to get handouts. It is unconscionable what has happened here. On its own cognizance. and in violation of the congressional rule that provisions passed by both bodies should not be changed. the conference more than doubled the annual dollars on primary payments. They said you now get $50.000 for a primary payment for your commodities. we are now going to raise that to $125.000. That loophole was closed. They then reopened the loophole closed in the House and the Senate that allows large wealthy farmers to collect far. far more than that nominal payment limit. And they did this while they cut $8.5 billion from food stamps. What is interesting. what is very interesting and cruel. if you will. is that those folks who are upperincome scale. the wealthiest of farmers. they dont have to have any income threshold or test to see how much they make before they qualify for these payments. They dont have to tell us about what assets they have before they qualify for these payments. We dont have a cap on the payments that we give them. These are millionaires. And yes. for food stamp recipients. we have an asset threshold. an income threshold. We say. if you make so much money. you are not eligible for $1.40 per meal. You are not eligible. But if you are a millionaire. all bets are off. All bets are off. And you know those folks at the top rung. they are eating well. They are getting three squares a day. They are feeding their kids. And what we are going to do is to take food away from food stamp recipientsmen. women. seniors. children. and veterans. Where are the values of this great Nation? We have lost our way. We have lost our way. In the past. there has been a strong tradition of bipartisanship on fighting hunger and supporting nutrition. from the left. leaders like George McGovern. and from the right. leaders like Bob Dole who would come together to make a difference for families in need. In fact. Senator Dole called the egregious cuts to food stamps in the House version of the bill ""an aboutface on our progress fighting hunger."" This is because food stamps is our countrys most important effort to deal with hunger here at home and to ensure that American families can put food on the table for their kids. They help over 47 million Americans. nearly half of them children. meet their basic food needs. and they make a tremendous difference for the health and wellbeing of families. Food stamps have been proven to improve lowincome childrens health and development. reduce food insecurity. and have a continuing positive influence into adulthood. Childrens Health Watch researchers found. after collecting 14 years worth of data on over 20.000 lowincome families. that when families experience a loss or reduction in food stamp benefits. they are more likely to be food insecure. be in poor health. and their children experience intensified developmental delays relative to their peers. Food stamps also have one of the lowest error rates of any government program. It is around 3.8 percent. That includes overpayments and underpayments. I defy to go to any other agencylets look at the crop insurance program and find out what their error rate is all about. Food stamps are good for the economy. a positive impact on growth. because food stamps not only help to feed the hungry. they get resources into the hands of families who will spend them right away. The U.S. Department of Agriculture research shows that every $5 of Federal food stamp benefits generates nearly twice that in economic activity. Most importantly. of course. they are the right thing to do. Ninetynine percent of food stamp recipients have incomes below the poverty line. It is the job of good government to help vulnerable families get back on their feet. In the words of Harry Truman: Nothing is more important in our national life than the welfare of our children. and proper nourishment comes first in attaining this welfare. That is why. when he declared that ""the moment is at hand to put an end to hunger in America."" Richard Nixon called for a significant expansion of the food stamp program to ""provide poor families enough food stamps to purchase a nutritionally complete diet."" This is something we all used to agree on. But now we are seeing a farm bill that cuts deeply into food stamps. and I ask again. how can anyone possibly support this? Keep in mind. food stamps have already seen deep and dangerous cuts. If you look at the fridge in the picture that I am holding up. this represents where we should be in terms of access to food. But because of the recent expiration of the Recovery Act provisions. food stamps have already been cut by $5 billion next year. and they will be cut by $11 billion over the next 3 years. On November 1. 2013. SNAP benefits were reduced. about $36 less for a family of four each month. This means that a family of four loses $36. or 16 meals a month. in support. That is the difference between health and hunger. Now this Congress wants to enact another $8.5 billion in cuts. meaning an additional $90 per month. and that much more food taken away from 850.000 households. This is the proposed farm bill. SNAP cuts would result in 850.000 households. 1.7 million people. losing almost $90 a month in monthly benefits. And already. for far too many Americans. the last few weeks of the month. this is what their fridge looks like. Why would we put any more hardship on the most vulnerable families in our Nation. families who are already battling food insecurity and hunger? They will have an empty refrigerator. No one should go hungry due to food stamp cuts. However you cut it. this is a terrible policy. Cutting food stamps will cause more hunger and health problems. These cuts are a dereliction of our responsibility as Members of Congress and our moral responsibility to help the least fortunate among us. As the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has said: We must form a ""circle of protection"" around programs that serve the poor and vulnerable in our Nation and throughout the world. Or in the words of Pope Francis: The scandal that millions of people suffer from hunger must not paralyze us. but push each and every one of us to act singles. families. communities. institutions. governments to eliminate this injustice. Mr. Speaker. this farm bill takes us in the wrong direction. Instead of helping to end hunger. it cuts food stamps by $90 a month for 1.7 million people. It forces poor families to choose between food on the table or warmth. and it does all of this while preserving loopholes and maximizing handouts for wealthy farmers and agribusinesses. We have to do better. I hope all of my colleagues in both parties will stand up against the outrageously misplaced priorities in this farm bill. I hope we can rekindle the strong bipartisan support that existed for decades for ending hunger in America. The astronaut Buzz Aldrin once said. ""If we can conquer space. we can conquer childhood hunger."" and we can. This institution has the power. It has the potential to make that transformative change. We have the ability. We have the means. and we have the capacity to eliminate hunger in America. We only need the will to do what is right. With that. I would like to yield to my colleague from Rhode Island. who is such a strong supporter of families in this Nation and who has seen the ravages of families who have lost their unemployment benefits. and now what we intend to do is not only have they lost their unemployment benefits. we want to make sure. with this farm bill. what it would mean is that they are hungry and that they are cold. I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for being here tonight."
1130071642,I cant thank the gentleman enough for your eloquence and what clarity you brought to the discussion around the connection between the lowincome energy assistance program and the food stamp program and taking it out of the realm of what people are trying to do. which is to demean it and talk about it as a scheme or a loophole. none of which is true. We can talk about some schemes and some loopholes in this bill. but they dont apply where it has to do with the food stamp beneficiaries. I want to pick up on a point that you made about the safety net. The farm billand I had the opportunity to work in 2008 on the farm bill. and particularly the nutrition piecehas always been a safety net for farmers and for those who are the beneficiaries of the nutrition programs. That is the link that was established. so that the benefits would go nationwide. not to a particular region of the country. not to a particular population. but a safety net so that we could make sure that people in bad times. in difficult times. could be able to sustain themselves. That is what has been broken apart here with this farm bill. The point is that where the farm bill conferees will say that they are cutting back on these payments to farmers. what they have done is to create a series of other programs where these folks can make themselves whole through crop insurance. through putting more farm managers on the land and no restrictions as to how many you can put at $125.000 a pop. So they found ways in terms of which they make these folks whole. The only beneficiaries in the farm bill who have no place to go when you cut back on that $90 a month are the food stamp recipients. So you have yanked the safety net away from them and you have done it to benefit the wealthiest farm interests in the Nation. It is wrong. That bipartisan support we had in the past for a safety net is what created strength. I am sad to tell you that that has been rent asunder. and we cannot let that happen. I am going to encourage my colleaguesand I know you willthat we will defeat this effort to leave people without sustenance in this Nation. I thank the gentleman for participating tonight. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130098674,"Mr. Chairman. currently this bill mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission spend $52.6 million of its already limited budget on information technology. My amendment. put forward with my colleagues Congresswoman WATERS of California and Congressman HIMES of Connecticut. reduces this IT setaside back to its current level of $35 million. Americans want to see more accountability from Wall Street and oil speculators and fewer reckless transactions. market failures. and bailouts. That is the CFTCs job. to rein in gambling with risky derivatives on Wall Street and prevent undue speculation on oil. Republican and Democratic experts both have argued that the current funding level purposefully sets the CFTC up for failure. The current bill leaves CFTC dangerously underfunded. 22 percent below the Presidents request. This increased IT setaside is equivalent to reducing their budget by another 7 percent below last years level. By returning this setaside to $35 million. our amendment gives the Commission more flexibility to spend the budget they have on enforcement and examinations. to put more ""cops on the beat."" as it were. if they see fit. This represents neither a cut nor a rise in the current level of CFTC funding. While I think we should fund them higher. this amendment merely lets them use their budget to do their job. and they manage to do a lot. even with the limited resources we have given them. Last year. the Commissions enforcement division brought in just over $1 billion to the Treasury. That is more than the Congress has provided the Commission in the last 5 years. According to Acting Chairman Wetjen: The unfortunate reality is that. at current funding levels. the Commission is unable to adequately fulfill the mission given to it by Congress. The agencys enforcement staff is already smaller than it was in 2002. when the Commission was just responsible for the futures and options market. Today. this smaller staff has additional important and extremely complex oversight responsibilities. They must now also oversee the $400 trillion swaps market. and they are responsible for pursuing cases against reckless. manipulative. or deceptive schemes. We need to give the Commission the flexibility in allocating resources that it needs to do its job. to oversee risky market behaviors. protect consumers. and enforce the law. This amendment will allow them to do that. and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130112991,Madam Speaker. I must rise in opposition against this irresponsible and insufficient border supplemental. For months. Democrats have urged this majority to pass comprehensive immigration reformthe bill that was passed on a bipartisan basis in the United States Senatereform that reflects our values and the country that we want to be: one with strong enforcement at the border. the deportation of dangerous criminals. and a path to citizenship that protects workers. helps families reunite. and clears backlogs. But this Republican majority has done nothing. They have refused to act. My colleague from Texas is rightdoing nothing is not an option. Now we face a humanitarian crisis on our border that demands an immediate response. but the majoritys answer is just to send home the children who enter our country alone regardless of the violence and the imminent danger that they face. This bill only includes $197 million for providing shelter and care for these refugee children. While these kids are here. we have a moral and. yes. we have a legal responsibility to provide for their housing. care. and processing in the most costeffective way possible. This insufficient amount will mean that HHS will have to make up the difference through highpriced. shortterm contracts. That will cost us more in the long run. and it could result in cuts to other priorities. like education. health. medical research. and job training. If Congress tries to make up these shortfalls elsewhere. this is not responsible leadership. Our policy. signed into law by President George W. Bush. provides for the appropriate screening of those who may be victims of trafficking. and that rightly includes unaccompanied children. This supplemental appropriation would change this policy and would almost certainly result in children being returned to the violence that they are desperately trying to escape. America can do and should do better. We should help protect those kids who are in serious danger. and we should push the leaders of these nations to address the root causes of why so many of their citizens are fleeing. We should pass comprehensive immigration reform. It is time for leadership from this Republican majority.

970095853,Mr. Chairman. I would like to start by stating my general support for H.R. 3403. a bill which reauthorizes the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act for fiscal years 198283. Under the provisions of this act. the Department of Transportations Materials Transportation Bureau regulates the transportation of hazardous materials in Interstate commerce. In passing the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. the Congress clearly recognized the critical Importance of adequately protecting life and property against the risks of transportation of hazardous materials. This risk is ever present. particularly when you consider that tons of regulated hazardous materials are transported each year. Recognizing that these materials are an essential part of our economy. the Congress acted to minimize the risks associated with their transportation by establishing a uniform transportation policy. Such a policy seeks to assure the safety of all our citizens. However. I must also express my opposition to a provision contained in the bill before us which was successfully offered by Representative FRRAso when the bill was considered by the Committee on Public Works and Transportation. That provision is section 7 of H.R. 3403 which bans the transportation of large quantity radioactive materials by motor vehicle or railroad in or through any county having a population density per square mile of more than 15.000 persons. I am opposed to this amendment. Very simply. I perceive It as a precedent which Is completely contrary to the congressional Intent contained In the Hazardous Materials Transport ation Act. Specifically. it exempts a single localityNew York Cityfrom the Department of Transportations uniform regulationHM164of the transportation of radioactive materials. As such. It arbitrarily rejects the Departments exhaustive efforts to balance national and local Interests In pursuant of overall safety. It should also be noted that HM164 provides New York City. or any other locality for that matter. with two mechanisms so as to modify or eliminate the transportation of radioactive materials through Its jurisdiction. One mechanism would permit new or existing ferry routes to be designated by the State as preferred routes as long as the preferred route provides at least as great a level of safety as the Interstate System. The second mechanism would allow the Secretary of Transportation to make a nonpreemption determination under section 112(b) of the act if he finds that the State or local requirement affords an equal or greater level of protection and does not unreasonably burden commerce. The Ferraro language before us completely bypasses both of these mechanisms. I am also concerned that the Ferraro language will expose the residents of other areas who are impacted by the ban to potentially greater risks. I would like to point out that a recent Sandia National Laboratorfihs study shows that a ban such as this could actually increase overall public risks because of the proven higher accident rate on circuitous and less traveled roadways. This provision Is directly opposite to that finding. Furthermore. It should be noted that this language prohibits the transportation of radioactive materials through a densely populated area even If such a route Is determined to be the safest one overall. As such. it discriminates against and jeopardizes the safety of smaller communities In favor of a select number of countiesspecifically. four boroughs in New York CityBrooklyn. Bronx. Queens. and Manhattan. I believe that that is unconscionable. Finally. such an amendment will only invite other similar amendments. This will ultimately defeat the congressional mandate of a uniform transportation policy for hazardous materials. For these reasons. I strongly oppose section 7 of the bill and urge my colleagues to vote with Representative SHUSTER and me when we seek to amend this section. It Is my understanding that a substitute amendment offered by Chairman Jim HOWARD and Mr. SHUSTER. Wvill provide for the development of methodology for analyzing the comparative risks and costs associated with the transporting of large quantities of radioactive materials. Since this requirement falls within the intent of required duties of the Secretary found in section 109 of the act. I have no objection to the substitute amendment.
970131788,Mr. Speaker.*1 rise In support of H.R. 3071. a bill to amend the Noise Control Act of 1972. Briefly. the bill before us reauthorizes the Environmental -Protection Agencys noise control program for fiscal years 1982 and 1983. It also amends the Noise Control Act of 1972 so as to narrow the scope of the noise control program at the Federal level. That Is. this bill limits Federal authority for the mandatory regulation of .noise emissions to certain carriers who operate on an Interstate basis. and certain manufacturers who manufacture and distribute products in Interstate commerce. Specifically. these are the railroads. the motor carriers. the manufacturers of trucks. cars. motorcycles. and recreational vehicles. exclusive of truckmounted trash compactors. and the manufacturers of constrtiction equipment. At the same time. we have provided that all of the existing regulations promulgated for the manufacturers that I have Just listed shall remain In force and effect until amended or otherwise modified as au-. thorized bythis -act. This also holds for the railroads and the motorcarriers for whom the appropriate sections of the act. sections 17 and 18. remain qnamended by this bill. I would like to focus on our inclusion of motorcycles since its inclusion has been the subject of opposition In the other body. My position Is that the manufacture and distribution of such vehicles In Interstate commerce should remain within the compass of a single Federal standard. In other words. I see no reason to subject these manufacturers to the burdensome imposition of a variety of State and local regulations while retaining Federal authority for other vehicle manufacturers. To my mind. there is no such distinction to be made among the vehlcld manufactures. At the same time. I would like to point out that we are not intending to interfere in any way with the regulation by State and localities of the use of motorcycles. Such authority remains with the States and localities under the provisions of our bill. I would also like to focus on our inclusion of construction equipment under section 6 of the act. By so doing. we are retaining the EPAs authority to regulate the noise emissions of construction equipment. It is my understanding that the only regulations issued by the agency to date under this authority apply to portable air compressors. The specifics of these regulations were the result of extensive negotiations between EPA staff and industry.. Since they have gone Into effect. the rate of compliance has been impressive. While the Federal authority to regulate construction equipment has been eliminated in committee. these manufacturers have persuasively argued that the regulation should remain in full force and effect. Their rationale Is that the regulation provides cost savings with resulting lower sales prices to purchasers due to uniformity of manufacture. As they correctly point out. such Federal authority serves to preempt State and local jurisdictions from promulgating a varity of regulations which manufactures would then have to comply with. I would conclude by stating that this bill has the support of the committee. those members of industry who are affected. and the administration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
970153465,Mr. Chairman. I rise In opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. I was prepared to come before the House today and note the very strong bipartisan support that moved this bill. H.R. 5789. out of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and brought It before us for consideration today in record time without a single amendment. without a single dissenting vote. Yet. I am somewhat dismayed to find we are here not with the prospect of considering the bill we just reported a few days ago. H.R. 5789 as reported. but to find that the chairman of the subcommittee must have had entirely different ideas in his mind when he was before the full committee. We had provided for a 13month extension of this antitrust defense that is contained in this bill. which permits the oil companies to participate in the international energy program. I think it is somewhat odd for this Chamber to be now trying to reverse what I April l. 1982 thought was a bipartisan understand- back to the House time and time again ing and agreement that we had in the because they have bruised egos about committee when this bill was reported. what the President did.

970207157,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 5427. the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act. This legislation has been requested by the administration and is an important part of U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba. It was favorably reported by the Foreign Affairs Committee by a vote of 20 to 5. It was then sequentially referred to the Energy and Commerce Committee. where it was again favorably reported by a vote of 23 to 3. The bill would establish a new Government radio station. to be called Radio Marti. which would be similar to Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Its purpose is to broadcast to the Cuban people objective information about Cuba and Cuban activities throughout the world. Our country needs to counteract the steady barrage of antiAmerican propaganda which the Cuban people receive from the Castro government and from Radio Moscow. the only international broadcast service targeted specifically to Cuba. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are known and relied upon by millions of listeners in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union for their objective information and interesting programing. Radio Marti will -offer the same wide appeal to the Cuban people. who have been deprived of this type of programing under Castros government. Such an effort to inform the Cuban people is essential in view of the increasingly belligerent July 2. 1.982 activities of the Cuban Government in the Caribbean and throughout the world. We must insure that the bill establishing Radio Marti does not set up roadblocks in the way of Its speedy and effective implementation. For example. it is vital that Radio Marti operate on the AM radio band rather than on shortwave. Shortwave is not the predominant means of receiving radio programing in Cuba. as it is In other parts of the world. In order to reach the largest Cuban audience. the use of the AM band is essential for Radio Marti. It is also important to avoid lengthy and unnecessary delays in selecting a frequency for Radio Marti. The Energy and Commerce Committee amendment provides that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) will assign a frequency for Radio Marti. This agency. which is a part of the Depart* ment of Commerce. is charged with managing the Governments share of the frequency spectrum. and It is appropriate that it select the frequency for Radio Marti. Assignment of Radio Martis frequency by NTIA will also avoid the long delays which are inherent in any proceeding before the Federal Communications Commission. An FCC proceeding. with Judicial review. could well delay the implementation of Radio Marti for up to 6 years. Such a delay would. in effect. be the death knell for Radio Marti. At the same time. the bill provides that the potential Impact on U.S. broadcasters is taken into consideration in the establishment of Radio Marti. NTIA is required to receive public comment from interested parties and must consider certain factors set forth in the legislation affecting interference and harm to broadcasters which may result from countermeasures taken by Cuba. I urge the adoption of the Energy and Commerce Comn.ttee amendments and the passage of the bill. At this point. I would call attention to Members the views of Representatives ZABLOCKI. PASCELL. WINN. DER-
970229038,Mr. Speaker. one of the key titles of this bill deals with certain changes that are made in the medicare and medicald programs. The fact is that the House conferees were able to achieve 3year savings of $13.3 billion in the medicare program and $1.1 billion in the medicaid program. for a total of $14.4 billion. I would call attention of the Members to the summary of the changes and the provisions that are provided in this title in the summary sheets that have been provided to the Members. I would remind Members that these savings and the spending programs are provided in this bill. Most of the debate thus far has been on the tax portion of the bill. Deficits have plagued the U.S. economy for the past 10 years. 10 deficits In the past 10 years. 19 in the past 20 years. They have come about because of the spending habits of the Congress. During this period the practice had been to add on dozens of new spending programs and each one of them with their builtin escalators. Now we have come to a time when no new programs are advocated. In fact. this administration is trying to reduce spending. Notwithstanding that. the deficit is growing. If it continues we are going to add almost $500 billion to our national debt between 1982 and 1985 and we are going to see the disastrous effects that that is going to have on our economy in continuation of high inflation and high interest rates. The root cause of deficits Is the fact that we have these uncontrollable spending programs. In this bill we have modest attempts to deal with some of these programs. As I say. modest. The total savings in this bill are some $17 billion. of which medicare and medicaid. as I pointed out. is some $14.3 billion. Medicare inflation alone Is running at 15 percent a year. That program will be bankrupt in 3 years if we do nothing. Medicare and medicaid together account for $75 billion in spending next year. 10 cents out of every tax dollar. Failure to deal responsibly with this bill will mean that the people. the economy of this Nation will continue to go through the meat grinder of high inflation. high interest rates. economic stagnation. I advocate. Mr. Speaker. getting on with the job of putting our economic house in order. I maintain that this bill is a step forward in helping balance that budget and licking the problem of deficit spending which has plagued this Nation too long.
970242702,Mr. Speaker. my colleague and close friend. the Honorable L. H. FOUNTAIN. will be leaving the U.S. Congress at the close of the 97th Congress. Today I have reserved this time for a number of L. H.s colleagues to pay tribute to him for- his outstanding record. After serving in the House for 30 years. my fellow North Carolinian has decided to retire. He was under great p.essure. both at home and here. to continue in the House. In fact. his decision not to seek reelection caught many by surprise. There are many things to say about the man we are honoring today. First and foremost. I want to say that L. H. FOUNTAIN is a gentleman. He is a Member whose word can be taken. When L. H. tells you something. you know that he means what he says and that he will stick to his commitment. His strong moral principles guide him in his daily work here in the House. and he sets an example in this regard which we should all follow. My fellow Tar Heel has left his mark in many areas of the Federal Government. Foremost in my mind have been his tireless efforts to make sure the taxpayers hard earned money is spent in the most efficient manner possible. This aspect of his career can best be seen in his successful efforts to install independent and powerful Inspectors General throughout the Federal bureaucracy. L. H. has been a pioneer in the field of FederalStatelocal relations. long before it became politically popular. His leadership and keen interest in this area resulted in the establishment of the Advisory Commission of Intergovernmental Relations in 1959. The Commission remains an active and influential voice in our Nation today. I could list many other areas which bear the fine print of L. H. FOUNTAINhis work in investigating harmful or ineffective drugs. his persistent and effective work as member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. and his role as a U.S. Delegate to the 22d General Assembly of the United Nations. From his native Edgecombe County in North Carolina. through his education at the Univesity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. and his service as a North Carolina State Senator. Congressman FOUNTAIN has always been a leadera person who fought. and fought hard for his convictions. but who also worked effectively with those of different political persuasions. As the dean of the North Carolina congressional delegation. he has always put the good of our State and Nation ahead of narrow partisan interests. In short. he has been an effective voice for our State in Washington. Louise and I will always remember the many good times we have shared with L. H. and his wife. Christine. who has been a hard worker and a terrific helpmate. We wish for the Fountain family many years of continued success. good health. and much happiness.
970246101,Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for all that additional time. I am not sure that we will need all of that time. but I was glad to accommodate Members who had asked me for time at this particular point. The gentleman from Pennsylvania had to go chair a subcommittee meeting in another part of the Capitol. and of course the important announcement by the majority leader was one in which we are all interested. Now. let us get to the amendment at hand.. the substitute. I would hope that Members would have the opportunity to take a look at the bill we are considering here and to read the committee report. I would point out that we who sponsored this amendment are supportive of much of the goals of this legislation. However. we are very much concerned about the excessively high authorization levels that are included in this bill. We are also concerned. about the substantial substantive recodification of the various authorities affe6ting the various health Institutes at the National Institutes of Health that are found in this bill. Our substitute continues our longstanding commitment to biomedical research. and longstanding commitment to the National Institutes of Health. However. it does this at a far less authorization level. Our substitute contains the following provisions: It continues the support for important biomedical research programs at levels of 7 percent above 1982 budget. Now. compared to the bill that is before us that we are attempting to amend. our substitute would save the taxpayers $165 million in just the next fiscal year alone. At the same time. our substitute would provide for generous resources for NIH research. In addition. our substitute provides for simple extensions of expiring authorities rather than the total revision of NIH authorities that are called for in the Waxman bill. In our judgment. this would be far less disruptive to an agency of whose research program against disease depends upon a stable managerial and organizational environment. Now. what we provide for In order to look ahead at whatever problems might exist in the organizational structure of NIH is for a study of the organizational structure of NIH in order to better have information to make future decisions regarding the creating of new Institutes or the authorities of the old Institutes. We do have one section of our substitute that is Identical to the Waxman bill. and where there is general consensus that this should be done. That is the creation of a new Institute on Arthritis. In our substitute a new Arthritis Institute is created with the exact provisions and funding levels of the Waxman bill. This new Arthritis Institute would promote research that Is focused on arthritis as well as musculoskeletal diseases. In addition. we huve a study that is not found In the Waxman bill. and that is a study and review of the use of animals in biomedical and behavioral research. We feel that the information from this study will improve our oversight of this activity. and we feel that we should have a look at this and the review that will be made possible as a result of this will let us find out more about this Important area. Mr. Chairman. our substitute that I am offering today on behalf of myself. the gentleman from Texas . and the gentleman from Illinois . offers many advantages over the bill before us. No. 1. it continues our commitment to biomedical research. but it does this at far more responsible fiscal levels. In additionand this is very importantour substitute provides for the present structure of management and operations of NIH without the recodification that is provided for in the Waxman bill. We think it is unnecessary and potentially disruptive to make these changes in the management and operating procedures of NIH and its various component institutes. We feel that the bill before us would create a detailed inflexible administrative frathework that may have undesirable effects on the quality of research. that is conducted and supported by NIH. So. if the Members would want to vote for more sensible administrative management framework. if they want to vote for lower authorization levels that will continue research. and also provide for additional funds over and above 1982 we urge you to vote for this substitute. We are not cutting. We are only slowing down the growth rate. We urge the Members to vote for this substitute.
970254563,"Mr. Chairman. let me just take a few minutes at the outset to respond to some of the allegations that have been made. not only with respect to the Luken amendment. but also to explain the terms of my amendment as to what it does. The gentleman from Ohio has made the allegation and has actually stated that his amendment is a moratorium on FTC regulations. This is no moratorium amendment that the gentleman from Ohio has offered. The gentleman from Ohio has offered an amendment that would permanently exempt all State licensed professions from FTC law enforcement. Now. despite the use of the word ""moratorium"" In the bills by the introducer of this bill and this amendment. the exemption would be just as permanent as any other legislation that is adopted by the Congress. I want to point out to the Members. and I hope that they are listening back in their offices or wherever they may be. to clarify the number and the types of professions who would be exempted from FTC jurisdiction should this amendment pass. It may include lawyers. dentists. physicians. engineers. accountants. architects. nurses. chiropractors. pharmacists. actuaries. optometrists. veterinarians. podiatrists. clinical psychologists. surveyors. beauticians. and I could go on and on. Any profession -which is licensed at the State level could conceivably be exempted from the FTC consumer protection laws. I do not think that is what we want to do. The amendment that I am offering would also limit the Commission authority. The allegation has been made somehow that the compromise that I am offering would somehow expand FTC authority over jurisdiction. This is not true. It does just the opposite. It does limit the Federal Trade Commission authority over the professions. I recognize that the States have a very important role in regulating professionals. They currently regulate the educational licensing and quality of care rendered by various professions within their borders. I think that that State regulation is necessary to protect the health. safety and welfare of their citizens. And I do not believe that the Commission should be involved in those matters. My substitute says that the FTC should not interfere with State laws or regulations that. for example. do thisthat set out the qualifications that someone must meet in order to take a professional licensing exam. set standards for the professional school accreditation. It would also say the FTC could not interfere with the determination of the content of licensing examination. My amendment would also say that the FTC could not interfere with State laws or regulations that have the effect of reviewing incompetent or unethical professionals under peer review programs. or to decide that only certain types of professionals may perform certain procedures. And also my amendment includes a limitation on FTCs antitrust authority. which again defers to the State role. Specifically. my amendment. and that is found in the early part of my amendment. which was just read by the Clerk. incorporates what is known as the State action doctrine into the FTC Act. That would insure that States can establish policy within their borders which the FTC could not callenge under its antitrust authority. This restriction in the law would provide antitrust immunity for professionals from FTC action if the State were to enact for example laws declaring that only certain professionals can perform particular procedures. laws that seek to control costs by regulating professional pricing practices. or laws that protect consumers from incompetent or unethical professionals. Now. apparently the controversial part of my amendment that is objected to by the gentleman from Ohio and those who are supporting his amendment is the fact that my amendment does preserve FTC authority to challenge a State law that prescribes a business or commercial practice for professionals. and which Is anticompetitive. I will hasten to point out that the Commission. under the terms of my substitute. must meet the burden of proof for both elements before it could proceed either on a casebycase action or in any rulemaking. In other words. my amendment would preserve the FTC authority to challenge deceptive acts or practices where it is proved that a business or commercial act or practices have been carried on. and I think that we should preserve that narrow amount of the FTC authority. There are certain examples of professional conduct that the FTC has challenged. The gentleman from New Jersey has already enumerated some of these. There was a Texas case. for\ example. where local doctors threatened to boycott a towns hospital emergency room if the hospital recruited a new physician to the town. on terms that the physicians did not like. And there was another case in Florida where the local medical association acted to prohibit truthful advertising by doctors and in effect they were trying to block the physicians from truthfully advertising whether or not they accepted medicare assignments as payment in full. advertising whether they accepted credit cards. or advertising whether the Spanish language was spoken in their office as a second language. or advertising whether or not senior citizens could get a discount. And these are business or commercial practices. they have nothing to do with the quality of care. But it is that kind of restraint that stifles competition. drives up health care costs. And it is especially injurious to the elderly. to the poor and to the working people. For that reason. I strongly urge the adoption of my substitute. and rejection of the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio"
970261768,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to H.R. 5133. the Fair Practices in Automobile Products Act. I consider it most unfortunate that H.R. 5133 is before the House today. I recognize that many Members of the House believe that this -bill is an appropriate vehicle to address the very serious unemployment problems in the U.S. auto industry. In addition. some believe this bill will send a long overdue signal to Japan and our other foreign trading partners of problems created by tariff and nontariff barriers which must be resolved by this country. I strongly believe that both of these problems are real and need to be addressed. However. I just as strongly believe that H.R. 5133 is not the answer to either of these problems. Let me explain. The negative effects of this bill far outweigh any benefits which might flow from its enactment. Although proponents of the bill argue that the bill would result in over 800.000 new jobs in the auto industry. information provided by the Conimerce Department and by the Congressional Budget Office indicates that this bill will result in a net loss of jobs. This will occur if one takes into account its negative impact on jobs at U.S. assembly plants of foreign auto manufacturers. at U.S. port facilities. and the repercussions throughout other American industries as our trading partners retaliate. We can safely assume that such retaliation will result in the substantial loss of American jobs in our export industries. According to the Congressional Budget Office. this bill will undoubtedly Increase car prices in this country. It will also push up the overall rate of inflation by increasing the Consumer Price Index by an estimated 0.1 percentage points. In addition. H.R. 5133 will make the U.S. auto industry less competitive just at a time when the industry is making strides to become more competitive in the world market. Based on these facts. both the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission have indicated that this bill is both anticonsumer and anticompetitive. As the Federal Trade Commission stated in their comments. this bill would result in ""less competition. higher production costs. and higher automobile prices to consumers."" The U.S. Trade Representative and the Departments of Treasury. Transportation. and Agriculture also oppose the bill. Even the bills purported benefits have been called into question. Several recent studies do not corroborate the UAWs estimate of jobs which would be created by this bill. Since the committee reported this bill. at least 50 associations and organizations representing a cross spectrum of American industry have taken a positicn opposing this bill. These organizations include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. the National Association of Manufacturers. the American Farm PQureau Federation. and the American Association of Port Authorities. We should not vote for a bill which is opposed by so much of American industry. In just 10 pages. this bill totally reverses over 30 years of American trade policy. H.R. 5133 clearly is violative of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Should this bill be enacted. GATT signatories can be expected to seek compensation for lost exports to the United States. The Department also points out that. if we do not approve tariff reductions to meet these claims. our trading partners will most likely retaliate against our exports. Exports which are especially vulnerable include aircraft. office equipment. electrical and electronic components. corn. wheat. and soybeans. This bill would also. I believe. destroy any hope that we have of opening up trade in servicesa frontier of critical importance to the future of the U.S. economy. By enacting a content law. we would suddently drop from the ranks of the major trading powers to join with the lesser developed countries. This is not an investment bill. as the proponents of the legislation would have us believe. In fact. it Is opposed by General Motors and Ford Motor Co. It is also opposed by all of the auto manufacturers who have invested in this countrythat is. Volkswagen of America. American Honda Motor Co.. and Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp.. U.S.A. In summary. I strongly urge my colleagues to seriously consider all the negative effects that this bill would have upon the economy of this country. I must oppose H.R. 5133 and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. . 01040"

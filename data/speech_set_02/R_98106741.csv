980059666,"Mr. President. I rise today to introduce.an amendment to S. 268. the Bureau of Reclamation hydro authorization bill which is now pending on the Senate calendar. Cosponsored by my colleagues from the lower Colorado River Basin States. Senators LAXALT. GOLDWATER. DECONCINI. CRANSTON. and WILSON. this amendment provides for additional hydroelectric development at Hoover Dam and serves as the legislative capstone to a negotiated settlement of the longstanding Hoover power allocation dispute between the States of Nevada. Arizona. and California. By way of a background. the 50year power allocation contracts for Hoover Dam are due to expire in 1987. less than 4 years from now. Competition for this resource between power customers in the three States has been fierce. and last fall. a major lawsuit was brought by Nevada and Arizona over the Department of Energys proposed marketing criteria for post1987 Hoover power. Until just a few months ago. all efforts to negotiate an outofcourt settlement had failed. A final settlement attempted in December 1982 resulted in the eventual acceptance of a set of 10 ""settlement principles"" by most of the major Hoover power allotees. All parties are working hard to resolve the few remaining issues. The final version of the Federal marketing criteria for the Boulder Canyon project (Hoover Dam). ParkerDavis project. and the Federal share of the Navajo Generating Station in southern Arizona is substantially compatible with those settlement principles. This has to be seen as a major breakthrough in this long standing conflict. Certain legislative steps by Congress are necessary in order to reach a final resolution of this issue. As the lower basins only representative on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I have been working hard with my committee colleagues. the administration. and the affected power users to draft the necessary legislative language. It is my hope that the Senate can move quickly. while the power allocation agreement is intact. to approve this amendment as part of S. 268. The amendment has four fundamental objectives. First. it helps pave the way for settlement of the outstanding lawsuit over the . post1987 Hoover power allocation. Second. my amendment authorizes the ""uprating"" or retooling of Hoovers 50yearold powerplant generators. One of the major elements of both the allocation settlement and the DOEs latest marketing criteria is the assumption that roughly 500 megawatts of capacity will be made available through this uprating program. Third. the amendment authorizes the construction of muchneeded visitor facility and safety improvements at Hoover Dam. including the construction of a new highway bridge below the dam. There are now over ). million visitors at Hoover Dam each year. and serious safety problems have developed which threaten not only the visitors but the dam itself. The amendment provides an authorization for $77 million in improvements at the dam. all of which will be repaid to the Federal Government through Hoover power revenues. The proposed bridge below Hoover Dam is badly needed to reroute heavy traffic and hazardous cargo that now uses the narrow twolane road over the crest of the dam itself. While the amendment does not provide for the financing of bridge construction through power revenues. it is fully intended to encourage State. local. and private parties to develop a suitable costsharing proposal for the bridge. Finally. this amendment proposes to dedicate a fixed amount of post1987 Hoover power revenues to the completion of the Central Arizona Project and the Lower Basin Salinity Control projects. both of which are vital to the future agricultural and economic growth of the Southwest. A 4V -milperkilowatthour surcharge will be applied to power sold in Arizona for financing of the CAP. while a 2Vmill surcharge in Nevada and California will finance the Lower Basin Salinity. Control program and will retire the cost remaining after 1987 of the Hoover power deficiency program. Mr. President. 6 months ago. I would not have believed that the States of Nevada. Arizona. and California could agree on what direction the sun sets over Hoover Dam. This amendment represents the culmination of many months of tough. nononsense negotiation. I have to give great credit to all parties and to this administration. particularly the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Energy. for their constructive approach. Indeed. the legal fees alone that will have been saved as a result of the outofcourt sttlement that I confidentially expect to result could probably go a long way toward retiring the Federal debt. Formy own part. I am proud to have played a small role in the shaping of todays amendment. Hoover Dam has had an enormous impact on the development of the American Southwest. and speaking for Nevada. the most arid State in the Nation. I cannot pay enough tribute to my predecessors in the Federal Government who had the courage and foresight to build Hoover Dam and other water development projects in the early part of this century. It was Nevada Representative Freancis Newlands who introduced the original legislation which formed todays Bureau of Reulamation. The Newlands project in northern Nevada. authorized in 1903. was the very first Federal reclamation project. The first major multipurpose reclamation project. Hoover Dam. was completed in 1935 at the height of the Great Depression. Electricity from Hoover was vital to Americas war effort in the early 1940s. helping power the munitions plants in Henderson. Nev.. and the shipyards in southern California. Today. the Boulder Canyon project confers direct benefits to over 10 million water and power users in the Southwest. Flood control is another. often overlooked. aspect of reclamation development. At this very moment. record flows of water are being released through the Federal dam system along the Colorado River. Without the flood control benefits of these dams and the reservoirs behind them. this years unusual weather patterns would be devastating human life and property all along the Colorado River. As many of us know. the Congress has failed to authorize a single new comprehensive water development project since 1976. For many of us in the West. it seems that regardless of the merits of an individual proposal. Federal budget imperatives. heightened environmental sensitivity. or philosophical disagreements over costsharing with State and local governments have stopped western water development dead in its tracks over the past several years. I. for one. am hopeful that this impasse can be broken in the near future. Todays amendment to S. 268 represents a step in the right direction. especially in its approach to nonFederalcostsharing. and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill when it is called up off the Senate Calendar. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment. along with a sectionbysection analysis. be printed in the RECORD. I yield the floor. There being . no objection. the Amendments and the analysis were ordered to be printed in the RECORD. as follows: AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY SrNATroR HECHT TO S. 268 1. Section 1.

SEcTIoN sY SECTION ANALYSIS OF AMEND-"
980088692,Mr. President. I rise at this time to offer an amendment to S. 268. the Bureau of Reclamation hydropower authorization bill. This amendment is virtually identical to the printed amendment No. 1424. Introduced on June 21. except that the page and line references to 8. 268 have been changed to conform with amendments reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on May 20 of this year. This is a purely technical change. Cosponsored by my colleagues from the Lower Colorado River Basin States. Senators LAXALT. GOLDWATER. DECONCINI. CRANSTON. and WILsoN. this amendment provides for additional hydroelectric development at Hoover Dam and serves as the legislative capstone to a negotiated settlement of the longstanding power allocation disputed between the States of Nevada. Arizona. and California. It is critical that Congress move quickly. while the power allocation agreement is intact. to approve this amendment as part of S. 268. Mr. President. I am aware that a second degree amendment will be offered by Senator GARN from Utah. While this has been cleared by all of the original cosponsors. I would like to review its substantive background and articulate my understanding of its legislative intent. The amendment proposed by my colleague from Utah adds a new subsection 207(c). which provides that enactment of 8. 268 will neither support nor prejudice any right that may now exist to determine either by litigation or arbitration any question as to the interpretation or performance of 8. 268 or any other laws of the United States now in effect. Under the Senators proposal. the same would be true as to disputes arising out of any criteria issued in the future dealing with the allocation of energy from Hoover Dam. Presumably. my Utah colleagues proposal is prompted by his interest in preserving whatever rights Utah or entities within Utah might have to output from Hoover Dam. No entity in Utah has ever held a contract for the purchase from the United States.of Hoover Dam output. and from a legal standpoint. the Lower Colorado River Basin States of Nevada. Arizona. and California do not recognize any existing right of parties within Utah. including the State itself. to arbitration or judicial review of questions relating to the Hoover contracts now in effect. As to future output from Hoover Dam. or regulations associated therewith. the new subsection would appear to state a truism. that is. whatever rights Utah or any entity therein may have are neither affirmed nor prejudiced by the enactment of S. 268. Any such rights that may be claimed. therefore. must necessarily be established elsewhere. namely. under the terms of the Boulder Canyon Project Act or the Boulder Canyon Project AdJustment Act. This Is also true with respect to any claim of rights founded on regulations which are not yet in existence. for it goes without saying that before a regulation can confer a valid right. the regulation itself must have a statutory base. I am sure it comes as no surprise to my friend from Utah that in the view of this Senator. neither Utah nor any entity within Utah can assert claims to Hoover power that would be even on a par with the rights of the State of Nevada. let alone superior thereto. I believe my colleagues from Arizona and California support me in this interpretation with respect to their States rights to Hoover power output as well. Mr. President. this is all a long way of saying that because I believe the new subsection 207(c) adds nothing to the legal protections already accorded by subsections 207 (a) and (b). I do not object to6 its inclusion in this amendment package.
980104510,Mr. President. today I am Introducing legislation for myself and Senator LAXALT to transfer certain Bureau of Reclamation lands in Nevada to the Pershing County Water Conservation District. This bill is nearly identical to H.R. 2551. introduced in the House of Representatives on April 3 by my colleagues BARHARA VucANOVICH. The Battle Mountain community pasture is a 30.000 acre tract of land in Lander County. Nev. In the early 1930s. this property and Its accompanying water rights were acquired by the Bureau of Reclamation to better utilize the storage capacity of Rye Patch Dam. a main feature of the Humboldt reclamation project some 125 miles downstream on the Humboldt River. Because the land and its water rights were sold together to the Government. the full cost of the land became a reimbursable cost under the water districts repayment contract with the Bureau of Reclamation. Today. having fulfilled its repayment obligations. the Pershing County Water Conservation District is Seeking to regain title to these lands which. in essence. it has already paid for. The lands are primarily used as summer pasturage for many of the district farmers cattle. and the district presently employs a fulltime pasture manager on the site. It Is a wellrun operation. and as the Bureau of Reclamation attests. the use of these lands for community pasturage adds an important element to the economic viability of the Humboldt project. The necessity for special legislation to bring about this transfer arises from the fact that under reclamation law. a water users right in a project is limited to the beneficial use of water. even after contract payout. Reclamation project works such as dam. canals. and other appurtenant structures necessary for project operation remain under title to the U.S. Government. In the case of these pasture lands. however. the Bureau of Reclamation has long recognized that Government ownership Is not necessary for project operation. This bill has the full support of the Bureau of Reclamation. and I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated June 13. 1983. from Commissioner Bob Broadbent be Included at this point in the RECORD. followed by a copy of the bill itself.
980218484,Mr. President. I rise in sup)ort and am pleased to cosponsor the amendment of my good friend and colleague from Virginia. America has long recognized the dedication. hardship. and sacrifice of our men and wotnen in the Arnied Forces. The uncertainty and constant relocation experienced in the typical military life places tremendous pressures on them. as well as the members of their families. Unfortunately. we have been somewhat deficient in recognizing the great contributions of the military spouse. Throughout the military careers of their husbands. military wives. too. had to answer the call to duty and be prepared to travel at a moments notice to faroff and unfamiliar locations to reestablish a homelife for their families. This lifestyle precluded many from pursuing careers of their own which would have provided them with the security of a pension and health insurance benefits. Until the passage of the Unifortned Services Former Spouses Protection Act in 1982. many spouses discovered that they were expendable and could be thrown aside and stripped of all benefits. Many wvere forced to the e(-fare roles and using food stamps to survive. The Former Spouses Protection Act was an important first step in assuring that these inequities were removed. Unfortunately. because of restrictive eligibility requirements. many deserving former spouses were denied their earned benefits. Mr. President. the amendment of the Senator from Virginia would revise these eligibility requirements which unfairly penalize former spouses. The amendment would provide medical care as well as commissary and exchange privileges to certain former military spouses of a service member or former member who performed at least 20 years of creditable service. and. on the date of divorce. had been married to the member or former member for at least 20 yearsnot less than 10 of which were during the period in which the member or former member performed creditable service. No longer would the date of divorce. dissolution. or annulment of the marriage be a factor in eligibility determination. These former military spouses have stood behind their country and it is now time for their country to stand up for them. I would urge nmy colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the tollowing articles be placed in the RECOitD.
980237053,"Mr. President. I would like to make a few summary remarks concerning the upcoming vote to invoke cloture on S. 268. the Hoover Dam bill. Some people have questioned why. after only 4 hours of debate. a cloture petition was filed on this legislation. The reason is simple. This bill has already passed the Senate once. by unanimous consent. It has passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming margin. Hearings have been held li both bodies. and in my view. ample time has already been provided for Members to voice their concern and offer constructive. and I emphasize that word ""constructive"". amendments. This Is not the time or the place to be debating as fundamental an issue as Federal hydropower pricing policy. We have offered to hold additional hear ings on this subject. We have offered to make the Hoover contracts subject to any pricing changes that Congress might choose to make in the future. The Senator from Ohio has flatly rejected all of these offers. What the Senator from Ohio really wants is for the Federal Government to earn a profit on the sale of Hoover power. He wants to impose a tax on the 15 million ratepayers who benefit from Hoover Dam. supposedly to help balance the Federal budget. More fundamentally. he wants to impose a back door Federal tax on all electric consumers who buy power from Federal dams. Does anyone here believe this is the time or place to be debating such a fundamental public policy issue? That is what this vote is really about. In closing. let me try to correct some of the misrepresentations I have seen in the press and heard here on the floor during this debate. There is no subsidy inherent in the concept of tying the price of power to its cost of production. This is the way 98 percent of all power in America is priced. The electric industry is a regulated monopoly. Show me a public utility commission who allows its utillties to earn a profit on dams. coal plants. or any other facility whose cost of construction has been fully repaid by the ratepayers. The Senator from Ohio claims that this bill will encourage the wasteful use of electricity in the American Southwest. He claims that power rates in this region are dirt cheap because of subsidized Federal power. This is nonsense. Hoover represents only a small fraction of the power generated in the Southwest. Its price is rolled in with all the rest. At the end of the line. where prices really count. Nevada. Arizona. and California consumers pay rates that are comparable to. and in the case of southern California. substantially higher than. the national average. Finally. the Senator from Ohio claims that we are trying to rush this bill through the Senate. He clatus that with a little time. he can work something out with the bills sponsors. He makes it sound as if we are being totally unreasonable in this matter. Let me repeat: We have offered to hold hearings. We have offered to make the Hoover contracts subject to any pricing changes that Congress might make in the future. This has not been good enough apparently. but this is unfortunately as far as we can go. We are not ready to make wholeJuly do. 1984 sale changes in Federal power pricing policy in the context of this bill. I hope this statement has helped clarify some of the statements that I have heard over the past few days. Again. I urge my colleagues to get on with the business of the Senate. and I ask their support of the pending cloture petition."
980237344,Mr. President. I would once again like to summarize the reasons why 8. 268 deserves final Senate approval this afternoon. As the original sponsor of the Senate amendment which now is the main body of this Housepassed bill. I want to assure my colleagues that this is a sound piece of legislation. representing the culmination of fully 6 years of administrative and legal battles over the future allocation of power from Hoover Dam. The 50year power allocation contracts for Hoover Dam are due to expire in 1987. less than 3 years from now. In order to provide adequate time for utility pianning and the execution of these new contacts. we must pass S. 268 now. It is imperative that we act now to authorize the $77 million in improvements at Hoover Dam. so that the States of Nevada. Arizona. and California can begin to raise the upfront capital required under this bill. The Senator from Ohio continues to insist that S. 268 Is being rushed through the Senate. This simply is not true. S. 268 has already passed the Senate once. by unanimous consent. It has passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming margin. Hearings have been held in both bodies. Where was the Senator from Ohio during the entire 13 months that this legislation has been before Congress? My reasons for opposing his amendments at this time are quite simple. This Is not the time or the place to be debating the fundamental issue of Federal hydropower pricing policy. The bills sponsors have offered to hold additional hearings on the pricing of power from Hoover Dam. We have offered to make the Hoover contracts subject to any pricing changes that Congress might choose to make in the future. What more can we offer in the context of this legislation? Let me conclude this statement by thanking all of my colleagues who have helped in the shaping of S. 268. Twelve months ago. I would not have believed that the States of Nevada. Arizona. and California could agree on what direction the Sun sets over Hoover Dam. Today. after months of negotiation and compromise. Senators
980271877,Mr. President. for many years now the city of Sparks. NV. has realized that an efficient. safe. and uptodate transportation system is vital to the future of what is known as the Truckee Meadows. Economic expansion and diversification have been keys to the phenomenal growth of the entire region and while this expansion is welcome. the resultant traffic congestion. air quality degradation. and severe strains placed on the highway network are not so welcome. While many ideas have been considered. the city of Sparks and its people believe the construction of a new interchange at Interstate 80 and Sparks Boulevard is the only viable solution to the problem. In 1980. an engineering study. commissioned by Sparks. indicated that an additional penetration of Interstate 80 was essential to alleviating the traffic problems in and around the city. While construction of a new interchange is a major undertaking. Sparks began the process and made formal application to the Nevada Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration to have the proposed Sparks interchange included in the Interstate Highway System. Approval was granted and the city next asked its citizens for additionpJ support. receiving overwhelming approval of a general obligation bond issue of $5 million to be used in construction of the interchange. As you can see. Mr. President. the Sparks interchange is one of the most important items on the citys agenda. It has become a key element in the Washoe County master plan of streets and highways and upon completion. will serve as a key northsouth regional link. Most important. the new Sparks Boulevard interchange will achieve the overriding goal of improved traffic safety. reduced congestion. and upgraded air quality for the entire area. The Sparks interchange project has strong State and local support and I think it is additionally significant that local industries such as General Motors Warehousing & Distributioh and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. all have indicated their support for construction of Sparks interchange. Mr. President. orderly growth and development in the city of Sparks is dependent on a highway system that will accommodate everincreasing levels of tourist and interstate commercial traffic. The growing pains of a progressive community must be dealt with sufficiently and the addition of Sparks interchange will help achieve that goal.
980272036,Mr. President. I want to take a few minutes to commend John Laszlo. a congressional fellow sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. for his fine work as a member of my staff over the past year. Johns professional expertise is in the design of geothermal powerplants and emission control equipment. As such. his handson experience with this complex technology has proven invaluable to me during the past years legislative efforts in the alternative energy area. Certainly the most concrete accomplishment of Johns fellowship has been the Senates passage yesterday of a geothermal leasing amendment to the continuing resolution. Congress has been struggling for over 5 years to revise and update the 1971 Geothermal Steam Act. This has been a very contentious issue. and I am pleased to acknowledge Johns very significant role in securing the Senates enactment of a 2year extension of currently expiring geothermal leases so that Congress has time to resolve this issue once and for all in the 99th Congress. In connection with this legislative effort. John was instrumental in setting up a very successful field hearing of the Senate Energy Committee in Reno. NV. this past April. The topic was geothermal development in Nevadas great basin. and as all of my colleagues know. organizing an informative field hearing is no small feat. It was the real world input from witnesses at this hearing that shaped the final language of yeterdays geothermal amendment. Finally. I want to thank John for the truly yeomans work he has performed in the daytoday handling of constituent requests. We all know how important constituent service is. but it takes a special kind of person to really get the Job done. making that extra phone call or doing that extra bit of research. John made sure the Job was done right. In all these duties. John will be a very hard man to replace. I wish him well in the resumption of his engineering career. and I know that his experience in Washington will serve him well in the years ahead.

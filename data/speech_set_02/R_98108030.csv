980027824,Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 142 is a 2hour. open rule under which the House will consider H.R. 1983. a bill that has the noble purpose of creating a new $760 million Federal program to provide relief to families in risk of losing their homes through mortgage foreclosure. This bill ought to be called the Mortgage Foreclosure Incentive Act of 1983 because it does not promote forbearance by this Nations banks and thrift institutions. but rather it creates an incentive to default and will probably lead to additional foreclosures. As the gentleman from Massachusetts has noted. this rule contains two waivers of points of order that would otherwise lie against consideration of the bill. provides that each section of the bill will be considered as read. and It provides one motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker. the first waiver is of section 402(a) of the Budget Act. which requires that bills containing new budget authority be reported by May 15 of the preceding year. In this situation. the advocates of H.R. 1983 want to create a homeowners emergency relief fund and authorize $760 million in appropriations this year for mortgage assistance. They did not report their bill by May 15 of last year. so this waiver would be necessary if the House is to take up the matter. The second waiver is of clause 5 or rule XXI. which prohibits appropriations in a legislative bill. Mr. Speaker. there was no controversy about this rule in the Committee on Rules. The minority members of the Banking Committee appeared in support of an open rule. despite their strong opposition to the bill. Under the general theory that an open rule will permit extensive amendments. I support this rule. According to testimony we received in the Rules Committee from the gentleman from Connecticut . this bill contains no safeguards on Federal mortgage aid going to a person who has more than one house. or who owns luxury cars. All that is required. according to our testimony. is for a person to be in default for 90 days on his home mortgage. have his mortgage holder fill out an application for assistance and postpone foreclosure by having the Federal Government pay his mortgage. Mr. Speaker. the bankers of this Nation and the savings and loan officials of this Nation do not want to foreclose on home mortgages that are in temporary. shortterm default. Government regulations are the cause of high foreclosure activity in the various regions of the country. In those areas of the nation were severe economic conditions are causing widespread unemployment. which in turn generates higher than normal foreclosure rates. there are much better ways to assist people who are in danger of losing their homes. Mr. Speaker. one of the most effective ways to promote forebearance. that is to postpone any legal action of foreclosure. is to encourage lenders and homeowners to cooperate in arranging terms for a loan extension that the homeowner can afford. Under this bill. assistance is available only when the homeowner stops making mortgage payments and when the lender moves to foreclose. This will not result in forebearance. and it may very well lead increasing foreclosure rates. The minority members of the Committee on Banking and Urban Affairs are prepared to offer amendments to this bill. and under this rule they will be permitted to do so. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to adopt this rule so we can proced to clean up this unworkable and unworthy bill. Mr. Speaker. I yield such time as he may consume to the ranking minority member of the Committee on Banking. Finance and Urban Affairs. the gentleman from Ohio .
980052493,Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 198 is an open rule under which the House will consider authorization legislation for the Department of State and related agencies for fiscal years 1984 and 1985. The rule waives points of order that would otherwise lie against consideration of the bill for failure to comply with the Budget Act. as well as points of order that otherwise lie against the bill for failure to comply with clause 5 of rule XXI. As the gentleman from Ohio pointed out. these waivers have become fairly routine for this legislation and there was no opposition to the waivers during our hearing in the Committee on Rules. Mr. Speaker. this rule makes In order the consideration of H.R. 2915. and bill which authorizes $3.29 billion in fiscal 1984 and $3.59 billion in fiscal 1985 for the Department of State. the U.S. Information Agency. the Board for International Broadcasting. and the InterAmerican Foundation. The bill also authorizes supplemental requests of $5 million for the Department of State. $15 million for the U.S. Information Agency. and $21.82 million for the Board for International Broadcasting for fiscal year 1983. The rule waives section 402(a) of the Budget Act because the 1983 supplemental authorizations were not reported on or before May 15. 1982. and would therefore subject the bill to a possible point of order. In addition. several provisions of H.R. 2915 may constitute appropriations in a legislative bill. and the waiver of clause 5 of rule XXI is provided in order to avoid a point of order against the bill. Mr. Speaker. in addition to granting these two waivers. the resolution provides that the bill shall be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. and it provides foit one motion to recommit. As to the bill itself. H.R. 2915 authorizes appropriations totaling $3.289 billion for the Department of State. the U.S. Information Agency. the Board for International Broadcasting. the InterAmerican Foundation. and the Asia Foundation. aid it establishes the National Endowment for Democracy. The amounts authorized for fiscal 1984 are almost identic~al to those requested by the administration. For fiscal 1985. however. the committee bill is approximately $16 million higher than the administrations request. In addition to these authorizations. the bill provides for the establishment of a National Endowment for Democracy. which will be a private. nonprofit corporation whose purpose is to promote U.S. private sector participation in democratic development overseas. Mr. Speaker. I support the rule as reported from the Committee on Rules. and urge the adoption of the resolution so the House can proceed to consider the measure.
980093114,"Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 309 is the rule under which the House will again consider the longest running. most controversial issue that I have seen in my 11 years as a Member of Congress. the coal slurry pipeline legislation. The rule has been described by the gentleman from Louisiana as a fair rule. I suppose it is. if you like the idea of forcing the House to rush Judgment on a lengthy and complicated substitute that has been available for only 3 days. The rule has bccn described as an open rule. and it is. Especially if you like the idea of using hours and hours of valuable time f~r amendments to fully debate issues that cannot be covered under the general debate that will be held later today. Mr. Speaker. the ruleis described as the Committee on Rules best effort to be reasonable and tile committees decision that the time has come for a vote again on this bill. We are to have yet another judgment in the House on the illconceived notion that Congress should give coal slurry pipeline developers the right of eminent domain over private property. We are to have another Judgment in this House that we should usurp the Nations founding principle of federalism and take from the States a right that they have held for 200 years. Mr. Speaker. this rule was reported from the Committee on Rules by a. 7 to 5 rollcall vote. That Is a majority. but what are the real views of the committee members? We had several hours of testimony and discussion on this bill yesterday and a majority of Septem~ber 15. 1983 CO the members of the Committee on Rules made It clear that they are. in fact. against this bill. Mr. Speaker. when the House was last given the opportunity to make a decision on this unsound and unnecessary specialinterest legislation. in the 95th Congress. a bill of similar content was overwhelmingly defeated by a vote of 246 to 161. That legislation was bad in 1978. It has remained sobad that during the intervening years it has not been brought to the floor again. Now it will be brought to this House floor in even worse shape than It was when it was reported from the two committees. This is not a simple ""eminent domain"" bill. nor i."" it a simple bill to foster ""fair competition."" This is a bill that would force consuimers to pay more for rail transportation. This is a bill that will force electric utilities to accept ""takeorpay"" contracts for their coal shipments and pass these unwarranted costs on to the consumners of this Nation. I think we all still remember the ""takeorpay"" provisions in the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1977 and the havoc it has wreaked upon the consumers of this Nation. I submit that this will be very much like that legislation. This is a bill that will put railway labor out of work. We are asked by this bill to turn our backs on the investment that America has made in the railroads of this Nation. In my 11 years of service. this Congress has twvice come to the aid of the railroad retirement systemo. It cost us about $4 billion in 1974 when we passed that bill. and Just last August 1 we passed a piece of legislation at a cost to the taxpayers of $2 billion to again rescue the railroad retirement fund. This Is a bill that says our Investment. an investent made in America. on behalf of our taxpayers. should not be protected. This bill says our national interest in railroads as common carriers of every commodity and all articles of commerce Is not worth protection. If this bill ever becomes law. there will be thousands of railroad workers laid off from their jobs. and the Congress will again have to come right back and further bail out the railroad retirement system at no telling what cost to the taxpayers of this Nation. This is a bill that will prohibit States like Missouri. Nebraska. Illinois. and Iowa from having anything to say about the diversion of our lifegiving water. Mr. Speaker. this bill presents environmental hazards so great that I can well understand why no State would want to allow coal slurry pipelines to cross Its borders. There is an oil pipeline that crosses a farm that I own in Missouri. It also crosses the farm of a neighbor of mine across the creek. A couple of years ago the pipeline burst. It ruined not only the few acres of land that the pipeline crosses. but it also rendered useless the rest of that mans farm. but he can only be compensated for the few acres that were actually affected by the spill. Mr. Speaker. I do not want something like this to happen to other farmers In this Nation. to other property owners. when it is not necessary. I do not want people In other States to wake up one morning and find a farm full of coal slurry sludge. and there is sludge to be dealt with. Mr. Speaker. for five Congresses now the doubts about this bill have far outweighed the propaganda about coal slurry pipelines. 1 am confident that commonsense will again prevail as we debate this measure. Mr. Speaker. at this time I would like to yield 5 minutes to the ranking member of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee of the Committee onl Public Works and Transportation. the gentleman from Pennsylvania"
980099099,Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 312 provides for consideration in the House of S. 602. which authorizes radio broadcasts to Cuba as part of the administrations effort to counter communism in Central America. The rule sets the parliamentary stage for House consideration of a compromise agreement written in the other body to establish Radio Marti as a major foreign policy initiative of the President under the Voice of America. The compromise agreement. which passed the other body by a voice vote on September 13. has been agreed to by the bipartisan leadership of both of the legislative committees Involved. and was presented to the Committee on Rules as the best way to accomplish our goal reaching the people of Cuba with the truth. Mr. Speaker. the gentleman from Florida. our distinguished Rules Committee chairman . has explained that this is a less than open rule. The rule specifies 1 hour of general debate. to be equally divided and controlled by the leadership of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Ordinarily. when bills are considered in the House. floor amendments are not in order. Although the rule specifies one amendment. it will not be offered because the House has Just taken up and passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 68. which corrects the problem the specified amendment was also designed to correct. The rule still waives one provision of the Budget Act to permit consideration of 5. 602. As passed by the other body. the bill would be subject to a point of order In the House because it violates section 303(a)(4) of the Budget Act. The bill authorizes enactment of new budget authority for fiscal 1984. but it was not reported prior to May 15 of this year as required by the Budget Act. This waiver is provided In the rule because it is necessary. The waiver is supported by the members of the Budget Committee. and It should be agreed to by the House. As passed by the other body. the bill provided new entitlement authority. effective in fiscal 1985. for payments to broadcasters for claims arising from Cuban radio interference. The House has just taken up and agreed to Senate Concurrent Resolution 68. which corrects the enrolled copy of S. 602. so that It no longer provides this entitlement authority. With the passage of Senate Concurrent Resolution 68. the bill made In order by tills rule is in compliance with the Budget Act. This being the case. the amendment specified In the rule will not be offered by the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. Speaker. this is a lessthanopen rule because of the parlimentary situation we find ourselves In With respect to Radio Marti. The House has not taken up the bill reported from the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Energy and Commerce. H.R. 2453. It is probably a blessing that we have not debated that bill. because of the strong disagreements that existed between the members of the two committees. .Shortly after our return from the August recess. the other body worked out an agreement to establish a new Cuba service section In the U.S. Information Agency. which places. Radio Marti under the Voice of America. To their credit. the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from New York both feel that it makes more sense to act upon S. 602 rather than to take up the other bill. Since they are the bipartisan leadership of the Subcommnittee on International Operations. the Committee on Rules has fashioned this rule to fit the situation. I urge adoption of the rule. Mr. Speaker. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa . a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
980107867,Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 331 waives points of order against consideration of an appropriations bill for water resource development. H.R. 3958. This rule represents the recommendation of the Committee on Rules as the best way for the House to deal with the issue of water resource development projects that are to be funded by the bill. and the best way to facilitate House consideration of this Important legislation in a timely manner. The rule waives clause 2 of rule XXI against H.R. 3958. because the bill does contain legislative language In an appropriations bill and because it does make appropriations that are not yet authorized by law. Mr. Speaker. I want to reiterate a point made a moment ago by the gentleman from Massachusetts . that this rule does not preclude the offering of amendments to the bill. There has been some considerable controversy about water resource projects. flood control projects. and the like around the Congress for as long as I have been here. We had considerable testimony about the granting of this rule in our hearing yesterday in the Rules Committee. I have no doubt that when the bill comes up later today. or tomorrow. there will be even more controversy and debate. I simply want to point out that Members may offer any germane amendments. which are not themselves In violation of the Rules of the House. Mr. Speaker. the bill being brought to the floor by the Committee on Appropriations contains some $119 mnillion for 43 water resource development projects during the 1984 fiscal year. Twenty of these projects are not yet authorized by law. They are Included. however. in an authorization bill now pending on the House Calendar. The Committee on Public Works and Transportation reported H.R. 3678 In early August. and timely action on that bill is expected. The chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development. the gentleman from Alabama . made It quite clear to the Committee on Rules that these projects are included in the bill because of the urgency of the various situations. Mr. Speaker. I was pursuaded by Mr. BEVILs testimony and by the testimony of the ranking Republican member of the subcommittee. the gentleman from Indiana . that this bill represents their best judgment of the real priority water resource development projects. We were told that even If the authorization bill. H.R. 3678. were already enacted into law. it would not change the appropriations priorities. Mr. Speaker. It is not my purpose to explain the necessity for each and every one of these projects. That debate will occur when the Appropriations Committee calls up their bill. and I am sure the House will have ample opportunity to delve into the reasons specific projects are contained in the bill. I do want to say. however. that this rule does protect the bill from points of order. but it does not protect it from germane amendments. If we are to have an orderly consideration of the bill. if we are to allow the members of the Appropriations Committee the opportunity to explain their bill. then we must adopt this rule. I support this rule. and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker. at this time I yield as much time as he may consume to the distinguished minority member of the Appropriations Committee. the gentleman from Massachusetts .

980127665,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. First of all. let me say this relative to my distinguished chairman for whom I have the highest regard. Chairman PEPPER is a fair chairman. and he Is very kind and very courteous to the minority and for that I express my appreciation because he has always extended these courtesies. These other amendments that are a part of this resolution and are placed in there by people who did not appear. I have no way of knowing what they were going to answer. I did not hear Congressman BOLAND or Congressman ZABLOCKI. I do not know what their amendments will do. I think I did ask. when I asked Mr. LONG when he offered the Wright amendment. I understood he had one in there from Mr. PERKINS. and he said he did. I asked what would Perkins do to Wright. I said. ""What In the world Is Perkins going to improve on what Wright has done here?"" It was Indicated that something more had been left out in the school lunch program that they wanted put in. That was all of the explanation that I received relative to Perkins. nothing on Zablocki and nothing on Boland and I had no* way of knowing. They were not there. had not discussed it. What has happened here. Mr. Speaker. If I might. Is that we are moving too fast In a manner we should not be moving on trying to legislate and appropriate a continuing appropriation. As many times as we will do this. we will have these kinds of foulups. because It is not really what the vehicle of a continuing appropriation has the mission to do. and what we have here is. the majority. the distinguished majority leader said there was nothing substantive. There Is a billion dollars worth of new programs in the Wright amendment alone. a billion worth that has not been authorized. that in fact was rejected last week by a vote of 24 to 21 in the Appropriations Committee. and now we are trying to add it on in a continuing appropriation. and I think as long as we continue to do these kinds of things. we are going to have donnybrooks such as we have here today. I do not care to carry this thing any further from my part. I just want to say this. Again. I am not offended at our chairman. He has been a fair chairman. He is a fair chairman and I can understand the pressure that he was probably under to muve this thing along at this hour. but I do believe that we were doing the wrong thing at the wrong time and I think these things can be handled in the supplemental. I will be here to oppose the rule. and I hope that we will not continue to try to legislate on appropriations."
980140964,Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 364 is a restrictive rule under which the House will consider legislation Increasing the authorization levels for the Federal Communications Commission and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This rule. and the bill it makes in order. gives the House yet another example of the failure of our legislative committees to meet their reporting obligations under the Budget Act. This rule contains a waiver of section 402(a) of the Budget Act. The bill. H.R. 2755. authorizes enactment of new budget authority for fiscal year 1984. but it was not reported by the May 15 deadline this year. Mr. Speaker. the failure of our legislative committees to report out and act on authorizations in a timely manner is one of the major reasons the House is unable to consider appropriations bills prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. This failure is of major concern to the Committee on the Budget. but is apparently of little concern to the Committee on Rules. In addition to the Budget Act waiver. this rule makes in order the committee amendment reported from the Energy and Commerce Committee as original text for the purposes of amendment. and that substitute is considered as read. The rule makes in order the followIng amendments: One. amendments to change dollar amounts for the Federal Communications Commission authorization which are subject to dollar amount amendments. Two. germane amendments to seetioins 3. 5. and 6 of the bill relating to the funding levels and authority of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. and W HI 10202 Three. an amendment to section 8 of the bill. printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of November 8. by and if offered by Representative RoDiNo or Representative KASTENMEIER. This amendment prohibits the use of a telephone to make obscene or indecent calls to persons under the age of 18. or to any person without that persons consent. Mr. Speaker. the ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. the gentleman from North Carolina. asked the Committee on Rules to report out an open rule for this bill. The committee turned down our effoits to make this a totally open rule. although the reasons seemed pretty weak. Had the Committee on Rules reported an open rule. any amendments that might be offered would have had to be germane to the bill as introduced. Under this rule. we only have thle specified type of amendments. Mr. Speaker. the bill made in order by this rule. H1.R. 2755. increases the authorization levels for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by 5.6 percent when compared to the amount appropriated in fiscal 1983. But when compared to the current authorization level of $130 million. the amounts are 12 percent higher for 1984. 18 percent higher for 1985. and 24 percent higher for 1986. There will be amendments In order to reduce these authorizationi lev elsat least that much is allowed under this rule.
980257642,"Mr. Speaker. there are only a few times the House is given an opportunity by the Committee on Rules to preserve the integrity of the legislative process. This rule is one of those opportunities. and it should not be cast aside in a heated rush to load up the continuing appropriations resolution. This rule endeavors to restore proper legislative procedure in this House. because it gets us to the point of considering a cleanand I mean clean from all perspectivesappropriations measure that the leadership of both Houses has determined to be necessary to continue the operation of Government agencies beyond October Mr. Speaker. during our hearing yesterday. the Committee on Rules was presented with 11 requests from legislative committees or members wanting Septem ber 20. 1984 II 9900 to attach special provisions to this Appropriations bill. In addition. we received several complaints that some of the specifies contained in the resolution as reported from the Committee on Appropriations were not authorized. and therefore visited an injustice upon the legislative committees. The committee could have chosen the easy way. the path of least.resistance. Oh yes. we could have given in to all of the requests and reported out a rule that made everybodys amendment in order. Mr. Speaker. we did not do that. The Committee. on Rules chose the hard course. the tough course. We turned down all requests to add extraneous items and we offer the House a rule that provides the opportunity to also strip out the controversial portions of the Appropriations Committees bill relating to unauthorized projects. This is simply no way for us to do things. I think it is high time we put a stop to it. Mr. Speaker. this rule says: Enough is enough. this time we will not allow a few individuals to load up a continuing appropriations resolution. I urge my colleagues to listen to the Committee on Rules. realize that this is indeed the best way to proceed. and to vote for this rule. Mr. Speaker. we were. fair to everybody. We said ""No"" to all of them. Mr. Speaker. our colleagues know that I spent many years as a member of one of the most important legislative committees of this House. the Committee on Public Works and Transportation. I like to think that I know a little something about the legislative process. I like to think that I respect the concerns and desires of all the Members of the House when it comes to public works projects. At the same time. Mr. Speaker. I do not believe it is the duty of the Committee on Rules to ""take care"" of everybodys legislative problems. I do not believe it is the duty of the Committee on Rules to guarantee to a legislative committee that the eventual outcome of the legislative process will be the passage of their particular bill."

980027838,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 1983. the Emergency Housing Assistance Act. This legislation represents a plea on the part of the American people. it is a plea for Congress to act decisively to protect the most fundamental possession this society affords its members. their home. This is an issue upon which this body cannot afford to equivocate or be hesitant. We must answer the cries of Americans about to lose their homes through foreclosure and vote to pass this bill. H.R. 1983 responds directly to conditions which are the result of the severe economic recession that has gripped this country for the past 2 years. To qualify for assistance. a homeowner would have to demonstrate that the inability to make mortgage payments resulted from a substantial loss of income due to circumstances beyond their control. This bill does not make assistance available to households where irresponsibility leads to default. on mortgage payments. Instead. it is reactive to an unemployment rate which currently stands above 10 percent and a mortgage default rate which has risen to 2.36 percent. Some Members are inclined to point to statistics recently released by various Government agencies which indicate that our economic downturn may be abating. and suggest that there is no longer a need for an emergency mortgage relief program. While it is certainly the hope of all of us in this Chamber that this country will soon experience a time of economic prosperity. we should not lose sight of the fact that recovery will be a slow process and that the people who are losing their mortgages need help now. If this Congress is truly committed to assisting homeowners to keep their homes. we should show no reluctance in authorizing the appropriation of the relatively modest sum of $760 million necessary to establish the emergency loan fund. By passing this bill. this Congress would be giving a sign of good faith to the American people. We would be showing them that. by making 18month emergency mortgage loans available to those in need. we have faith in their ability to get back on their feet and resume their mortgage payments in that time. More significantly. we would be indicting that we have faith in our ability to make the decisions which will promote economic recovery and get these people back to work within that 18month period so they can. once again make the wages necessary to carry their mortgages. To not establish the loan fund. we would fail in our responsibility to those who are in danger of losing their homes. and we would be indicting that we do not have confidence in the Governments ability to get our economic situation under control. Let us not let the American people down. Congress must pass this bill now to assist homeowners in need. and then get on to the business of legislating longterm solutions so that this situation does not repeat itself.
980047826,Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation to close one of the loopholes in our campaign financing laws. I refer to the practice by which a political action committee may get around its statutory limit of a $5.000 donation to a candidate by conducting polling on a candidates behalf. a service often worth many times that amount. but whose value under current lw is computed at either 50 or 5 percent of actual cost. depending on how soon the results are made available to that candidate. Let me point out first that I dont think that any group should be able to give a candidate more than the $1.000 which individuals are restricted to giving. I have already introduced H.R. 640. to lower the PAC contribution limit to this level. Regardless of whether you believe that the present PAC limits are desirable or not. though. I think it is clear that the law should not boost such a conspicuous loophole as that which allows expensive polling services to be donated at a fraction of their true value. According to the information I have before me. one large and wealthy PAC was able to donate nearly half a million dollars to a number of candidates for Congress and report it on contribution forms as less than $50.000. So long as the $5.000 donation limit remains the law. this is clearly inappropriate. It is a loophole directly opposed to the spirit of the law. and we should close it at once. My proposal to close this loophole is uncomplicated. It amends the present law to state that nonmonetary contributions shall be calculated at the highest cost of either: First. cost to the person making the contribution. second. fair market value of the contribution at the time the contributor acquired it. or third. fair market value as of the date of the contribution. This means simply that a nonmonetary contribution should be counted at its actual worth. Mr. Speaker. I invite my colleagues to support this legislation. Regardless of your views about PAC regulation in general. I hope that all will agree that. so long as the present law is in effect. this gaping loophole must be closed. Election law must be uniform and must apply equally to all. without quirks and exceptions. Either we regulate contributions or we do not. but if we do. let us be sure that everyones dollars carry the same value. We must weigh contributions at their real worth. no more and no less. Simple fairness dictates that we do so.e
980066005,Mr. Speaker. the resolution implements the decisions of the House Page Board concerning a new page education program. which will provide our pages with the excellent formal education they deserve. It also responds to the concerns raised by the Speakers Commission on Pages. This new page education program will complement the excellence of the learning experience pages receive in their work for the House of Representatives. This resolution provides that each calendar year would be divided into three terms. each of approximately 4 months. The resolution allows a page to serve one or two full academic terms. and the page could also be appointed to serve for a summer term. or part of a summer term. The resolution provides needed continuity in skilled House floor pages. by allowing a -page to serve 1. 2. or 3 terms. insuring overlap. Finally. because some Members may already in good faith have made outstanding commitments to individuals to become academic term pages who will not be juniors this September. the resolution defers the junior requirement until the beginning of the second 1983 academic term. The House Page Board. on whose behalf I introduce this resolution. is totally committed to the need to provide our pages with a quality formal education. Therefore. quality education for our pages is the central issue. Although there are Members who have had their differences over the resolutions limitation on the length of appointment of a page. in the greater interest of the formal education of our pages. most of them have agreed that a quality education must and will come first. This resolution concerns whether or not pages. in spite of the unique requirements of their page duties. are entitled to a quality academic education. or should forfeit educational opportunity for the undeniable excellent learning experience of being a page. I am convinced that the two. page experience and page education. need not be mutually exclusive. They can and should coexist and complement each other to provide our pages with a truely beneficial experience while they are here. I urge your support of this resolution.
980068671,Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the Wylie amendnent. Mr. Chairman. I rise to voice my very strong opposition to this amendment. We are currently debating one of the most important pieces of legislation the Congress may consider this session. This legislation is a reaffirmation of our national commitment to provide a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family. It reauthorizes all of the major federally sponsored housing and community development programs and includes a very significant provision which is designed to stimulat.e the production of rental housing. It Is the implementation of the rental housing component of this bill which the proposed amendment would impinge upon. Some Members of this body are attempting to use this important legislation as a means of overriding a local governments ability to respond to the housing needs within its jurisdiction. By offering this amendment the sponsors are attempting to ransom much needed moneys for low and moderate rental housing production in return for a local governments freedom to respond to the rental housing market conditions In their area. I do not intend to belabor my colleagues with a full discussion of the relative merits of rent control. Quite frankly. that is a matter which could keep us occupied for quite some time. Suffice it to say that the correlation between rent controls and the decline of rental housing Is not proven. Most likely. abandonment and the decline of rental housing have been the result of a compilation of factors including high interest rates. restrictive zoning. and local building codes. Unless each of these causes were addressed individually. singling out rent regulation alone would be shortsighted indeed. Today I am simply calling upon the Members of this body to recognize the authority to stabilize rents as an inherently local prerogative. which should not be infringed upon through such heavyhanded techniques as the denial of much needed Federal housing moneys. This countrys rental housing market is actually comprised of numerous regionally oriented markets which differ from area to area. In my district of New Jersey. for example. the vacancy rate is extremely low compared to many other areas of the country. If at the Federal level. we were to impose a uniform. rigid policy which would have the effect of limiting the authority of local officials. we would be failing to recognize that housing markets differ between areas. and that the problems require remedies which are designed for each set of particular circumstances. By Ignoring the different rental housing conditions which exist throughout this country. we could be doing a very grave disservice to those with limited incomes who are forced to compete for rental housing in tight markets. Local governing bodies must be free to respond to their individual market conditions. A Federal policy restricting State and local implementation of rent control could severely impinge upon this freedom. I think it is ironic that those who are calling for the Federal Government to override State and local rent control laws belong to the same party which espouses the socalled New Federalism. a new direction of turning back authority and responsibility to State and local governments. To insure that housing opportunities can be kept available to members of all income groups. I urge that this amendment be defeated. and local governments be left to respond to their market conditions as they see fit.
980081192,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of my colleagues In whatever effort is necessary to coordinate a drug enforcement program that works. We are all aware of the success that efforts such as Operation Greenback has had on Illegal drug importation in the regions of southern Florida. In the early stages of that operation. many indictments involving even many more defendants were filed. Numerous other investigations have been opened and multimillion dollars have been seized from the drug violators. But do not let those facts deceive you. I have recently read a General Accounting Office report on the subject of Federal drug Interdiction. The report indicates that while cooperation among the three agencies responsible for the effort is increasing. each agency has different programs. goals. and priorities. I am sure you can see where fragmentation such as this exists. inefficiency and Interagency conflicts also exist. Despite the success of Vice Pre:sident Busiis initiative with the South Florida Task Force operation. we still fail to impede a large percentage of the flow of drugs into this country. GAO indicates that only 16 percent of the marijuana and less than 10 percent of heroin. cochine. and other dangerous drugs are being seized by our present enforcement efforts. The Subcommittee on Banking Oversight and Renegotiation has held hearings under the Bank Secrecy Act to coordinate the efforts of the responsible agencies. As chairman of the subcommittee. I am happy to report that cooperation is occurring. but a great deal more must be done. We must get the drug problem under control. I intend to do whatever is necessary to accomplish that task and I ask my colleagues support on the matter.o a Mr. PARRIS. Mr. Speaker. as a rmember of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the need for a comprehensive. centralized approach to enforcement of Federal laws against drug abuse and drug trafficking. Where a highly visible. highly prestigious official or task force has been brought to bear on the problem of drug trafficking. the results can be inspiring to those of us who cherish the hope that we can eliminate the plague of drug abuse from our Nation. Vice President Busns South Florida Task Force has markedly reduced the crime rate in that part of the country. The Vice Presidents task force is an example of the success which can be achieved when a strong central figure with access to the President provides the leadership necessary to coordinate the myriad. inultiagency efforts in the field of drug enforcement. In my congressional district. the Secretary of the Interior has announced an escalated enforcement effort on the George Washington Memorial Parkway. when trafficking there increased dramatically in response to steppedup efforts elsewhere in the Metropolitan Washington area. The problem in my district was a microcosm of the overall national problem. There was a temporary crash effort in a nearby jurisdiction which apparently achieved some success. but in the absence of a coordinated effort across jurisdictional lines. the effort also moved the problem to another area under Federal jurisdiction. which was not prepared or equipped to handle the problem at the time. The statistics reflect the current regional successes which we have enjoyed against drug trafficking. For instance. we have recently seen recordbreaking seizures of multiton shipments of marihuana. The Vice Presidents task force is having a noticeable impact in south Florida. Bringing the FBI into the drug enforcement fight and the creation of 12 drug enforcement task forces are strong steps to attack the drug trafficking problem with a number of new and original approaches. But the statistics also show that the successes gained under these various crash programs can be fleeting. The quantities of drugs which are entering the United States are still increasing. The increasing amounts of illegal substances entering this country indicate that we need a crash effort nationwide to make national statistics reflect the successes which have been achieved in some regions under a variety of programs and task forces. A centralized approach under one office is a possible solution which we must investigate. We all would like to see a sustained. coordinated drive against the problem. Jurisdictional and interagency rivalries must be set aside in the interest of cooperation. The question is how best to achieve better coordination. Creating a new Office of National and International Drug Operations and Policy or revising the authority of the Office of Drug Abuse Police might provide the necessary leadership to coordinate our disparate national efforts against drug trafficking. However. if either of these approaches gives us just one more agency involved in drug enforcement. we will only compound the current problem. No matter what we say in the statute authorizing a new central office. if the leadership there is not effective. it could be perceived by the other drug enforcement offices as just another agency on its own tangent. We must also be certain also that the primary mission of the central office is law enforcement. We cannot expect the office to concentrate Federal efforts if its own mission is diffuse. We must be certain that involving the new office in matters of health and prevention. while they are important concerns. does not detract from its mission of coordinating the various enforcement mechanisms. The goal of encouraging cooperative Federal efforts to bring drug traffickers to justice is an important one for Congress to consider. Let us be certain. however. that the central office is one which will be able to lead and not issue confusing directives to other agencies which will consider it a rival.e
980088963,Mr. Speaker. I address the House today on the important issue of our pages. The pages who come to the House of Representatives are entrusted to us by their parents for their educations. housing and welfare. This is a special trust. The House Page Board. since its creation last November. has taken great strides to honor that special trust. With the full support of the Speaker and the rest of the House leadership. the most dramatic andthe Board believesthe most beneficial changes in the page program since it began in the early 1800s have been implemented. To respond to the problem of afterhours supervision of the pages. the Page Residence Hall was established in Annex No. 1 and opened on February 1. The Residence Hall provides the pages for the first time with a model dormitory facility. The Board also put into effect a code of conduct for the pages. No system can guarantee that problems will never occur. but the Board sincerely believes every reasonable step has been taken to provide for afterhours supervision of the pages and their general wellbeing. The final step in improving the page program is to guarantee every page a quality education. To this end. the Board held education hearings and established a permanent education task force to advise the Board on educational matters. The task force is composed of Mr. WHITEHURST of Virginia. designated by the Board as the chairman. the executive directors of the National Association of State Boards of Education. the National Association of Secondary School principals. and the Association for Supervision and curriculum development and the Doorkeeper. the manager of the majority cloakroom and the mi-. nority chief page. The task forces report to the Board. as well as past evaluators. have criticized the Capitol Page School. Evaluators have found among other things that the pages SAT scores have declined and are now the lowest in the metropolitan area. Consequently. in June the Board unanimously adopted a new page education program recommended by the task force and the Board unanimously decided that from now on the Board would provide educational services for the .pages as the best way to implement the new page educational program and monitor page education to insure its quality. To carry out these decisions. the House was requested to adopt House Resolutions 234 and 279 and did so. The House of Representatives Page School has now been established and classes will begin on September 6. The principal. Dr. Robert F. Knauts was hired last week. Dr. Knautz is from Illinois and has impressive academic credentials and extensive experience as an educator. I have absolute confidence that Dr. Knautz will do an excellent job as the leader of the House Page School. I want to thank the members of the Board and the task force for their dedication and contributions to improvement of the page program. In closing. let me state that the obJective of the Board and. I believe. all concerned. is that the living conditions and education of our pages be exactly what we would want for our own children. The Board has never deviated from that objective and everyone should be on notice that we never will.
980092675,Mr. Speaker. we In the House have an Important and solemn duty before us now. I thank my distinguished colleague and good friend. the gentleman from Wisconsin for bringing this measure to the floor swiftly. so the House can register our collective revulsion and disgust over this barbarous act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution Which rightly uses the strongest possible condemnation for the inexcusable Soviet act of shooting down an unarmed civilian aircraft. In the last 2 weeks we have heard much about this tragic and atrocious incident. The outcries and furor it has generated are more than justified. The downing of a commercial passenger aircraft is an act which civilized society cannot tolerate. not only is It barbaric and repulsiveit literally threatens civiiized air travel as we know it. I fervently hope and state today. that as time passes on. and we get farther and farther away from the August 31 incident. we do not allow ourselves to forget this episode or the Soviets reaction to it. Por in the aftermath of this incident. the Kremlin Is revealing much of Its dark side. The Soviets are continuIng to offend the free world with lies and coverups. First it took Moscow days to even acknowledge that the plane was shot down. there has been little coverage of the human suffeIngthat 269 innocent people perished aboard the flightin the Soviet press. and now the Soviets are blamning the whole incident on the West and even suggest that It could happen again. We have been generous to the Soviets recently. by negotiating the grain agreement with them. For we know that the U.S.S.R. desperately needs to import grain. as their collectivized farming techniques are a disaster. I feel we would do well to at least reexamine that grain arrangement in the wake of the August 31 crime. Mr. Speaker. I commend my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee for their skillful work on this resolution. Of course. I wholeheartedly support this measure and urge all my colleagues to do so as wellthe House must send Moscow a message that Americans do not approve of the murder of innocent people.
980206826,Mr. Speaker. today at noon. a small band of veterans. representing the Allied Airborne Association. will place flowers at the monument to the 101st Airborne Division on Memorial Drive just outside the main gate to Arlingtons National Cemetery. It will be recalled that 40 years ago today. undercover of darkness. the 101st. along with the 82d and the British 6th Airborne Division. parachuted behind the German lines on the cliffs above Normandys beaches where the main assault of the invasion was unfolding. Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor. who commanded the 101st and jumped with his paratroopers that eventful night. wrote some very touching recollections for the May 29 Washington Post. He recalled that years after the war. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Supreme Allied Commander. said the news of their landing and entry into combat was the greatest moment of his military career. I would like to commend three menFrank Juliano of Staten Island. N.Y.. Salvatore Bascotti of West Orange. N.J.. a friend and constituent of mine. and Gilbert Wells of Arlington. Va.-for their dedication and persistence in creating an umbrella organization for veterans of all airborne units. including paratroopers from Great Britain and Canada. who served in World War II. Korea. and Vietnam. Mr. Juliano. who served in the 101st. is president of the Allied Airborne Association. Mr. Bascotti. who was in the 11th Airborne Division in the Pacific. is vice president. Mr. Wells. also a veteran of the 11th which was slated to jump as backup troops if the invasion of the Japanese mainland had become necessary. is the capital area commander and handles public relations here in Washington. There are others among the nearly 800 members scattered throughout the Nation and abroad who are moving in the same directionnamely. gathering names of airborne veterans. soliciting memberships. paying tribute to those who perished in the line of duty and. in general. advancing the cause of patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. I wish the representatives of this relatively new veterans organization well in gaining acceptance of June 6 as Airborne Memorial Day. along with the remembrance of Dday. It is a fitting commemoration of this significant event in the overall invasion and eventual liberation of Europe. I take pride in Joining them in this tribute to the nearly 1.000 casualties among the 13.000 paratroopers who took part in that historic operation..
980249975,Mr. Chairman. I rise to add my vigorous support for H.R. 3605. the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act. I commend the outstanding work of my distinguished colleagues. Messrs. WAXMAN. DINGELL. and KASTENMEIER for their assiduous efforts on behalf of this legislation. As we have discussed here today. this bill would make more lowcost generic drugs available by establishing a generic drug approval Procedure for pioneer drugs first approved after 1962. Under our current law. this approval method is available for pioneer drugs approved before 1962. A lengthy and expensive application procedure is required for generic copies of drugs approved after 1962. Consequently. it has been difficult for generic manufacturers to submit such applications and the buying public are the losers. Many patents have already expired for some frequently prescribed medications first approved after 1962 and many other important ones will be expiring in the next few years. It is estimated that availability of generic copies of drugs approved after 1962 would save consumers $920 million over the next 12 years. The Congressional Budget Office has observed that 10 generic versions of popular drugs now on the market cost half as much as their brandnane equivalents. Generic drugs are a valuable resource for combating the high costs of health care. Everyone in this country will benefit by enactment of this legislation. but I feel it is particularly important that our senior citizens who fill more prescriptions than other segments of our population. can save money on their medical bills. Moreover. it is reported that the Federal Government spent $2.4 billion for drugs in the medicaid program for the poor. and in veteran and military hospitals in 1983. Therefore. this bill is not just a matter of assistance to individuals. but an important savings for our Federal budget as well. This bill also extends the patent life for brandname. pioneer drugs. This extension was included to help protect the investment in research and development that manufacturers undertake to develop pioneer drugs. I wholeheartedly endorse this significant measure and call on my colleagues for their assistance in seeing that I.R. 3605 passes the House today.

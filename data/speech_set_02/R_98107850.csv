980021025,"I thank the gentleman for his comments. Let me. at this point. give my colleagues those unemployment statistics for that period of time when they were using all these programs that are now again being proposed. In 1932. the unemployment rate was 23.6. 1933 it was 24.9. in 1934. it was 21.7. in 1935. it was 20.1. in 1936. 16.9. in 1937. they dropped down to 14.3. but back up in 1938 to 19 percent. And so it goes. It shows that these programs do not work as far as putting people back to work permanently. Oh. they work temporarily. but once you withdraw the money the unemployment is still there. Now two points and then I will yield the floor. Another thing that I think is very important to point out about the Democratic budget is that by increasing taxes they get the budget deficit down slightly. But. they push $12 billion of spending from 1984 into 1983. $12 billion. And last. let me point out something that concerns me. For the first time since I have been here there would be an attempt to politicize the Fed. I do not think we want to do that. If my colleagues will turn to page 16 of this document. section 6. To that end. it is the sense of the Congress that in the reports to Congress required by the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978. the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall report to the Congress on the objectives of the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee with respect to the growth or diminution of the Gross National Product in current and constant dollars. inflation and unemployment for the current and three following calendar years. Let me say in committee I submitted an amendment to strike out the word ""objectives"" which the Fed was objecting to and include the word ""assumptions"" which they said they were talking about. The majority refused to do that. Now. hopefully. if this budget should ever get to conference. we will be able to take out that language in conference because we certainly do not want to politicize the Fed."
980036071,"Mr. Speaker. the new gag rule before us may not be compietely unprecedented but it certainly is an unusual and unbecoming lapse in our democratic traditions of free and open debate and amendment. Apparently the freeze advocates want to have everything frozen except the rules under which their resolution is considered. To use a sports analogy. this Is a little like a team coming out of a locker room after the halftime and asking the referees to make a few little rules changes. Never mind that they are ahead In points and already have more men on the field. they still want to shorten the second half. limit the number of passes the other team can throw. and be assured that they will be in a position to Intercept every one of them. Why. If that ever happened in a football game they would be booed off the field by their own fans. But. no. this is not a football game. though there are those who think this issue is a meaningless little political football that can be kicked around with no harm. It is the symbolism that counts. they tell us. it Is the crowd reaction that counts. But now that they are a little foot weary they want to take their football and go home. We were led to believe early on that we were debating the most critical issue confronting the Congress in this century. I strongly resent the charges that have been leveled by some. even in House leadership positions on the other side. that the opposition amendments to this resolution were frivolous and that their authors were obstructionists and worse. That kind of talk is unbecoming of any Member of this House because It impugns the motives of other Members. And anyone who has listened to the debate or the testimony from those wishing to offer other amendments when they came before the Rules Committee on Monday knows that the vast majority of the Members with pending amendments are serious. sincere. .and sophisticated in their grasp of the Important issues involved here. So before. you swallow the argument put forth by some freeze advocates that this resolution was being filibustered by amendment. consider the substance of the amendments which have been offered to date and the sincerity of their authors. the number of amendments adopted to this resolutfon. and the substantive contributions made by the debate on the substitute amendments. To the same. the managers have thrown up amendment after amendment to block a direct vote on opponents amendments. What does all this add up to? A onesided conspiracy to talk this thing to death? I think not. I think it is evident that both sides are sincere. But this has been far from a onesided discussion. Over onehalf. get that. onehalf of the 29 amendments adopted to date have been profreeze amendments. Of the 17 recorded votes we have had so far. roughly half can be attributed to the freeze side of the debate. But most interestingly. only 2 of those 17 recorded votes R 2605 have been straight up or down votes on amendments offered by opponents of the freeze. That q where the real problem has come. xne reason there has been some frustration and. yes. some repetition. One side of the debate has not been given any straight votes on its propositions. The freeze managers cleverly and quite properly under the rules come in with a neutralizing amendment to any amend. ments and this tactic denies the House a direct vote on the proposition. If this House has been ohasing its tail in circles for 35 hours it is because the proponents of this resolution have tied that tail to the nose with their own parlimentary rope. I think one of the most active partiipants in this debate put it quite clearly before the Rules Committee on Monday when he said that we could end this debate quickly if we just allowed one major amendment to each of three or four areas and has an up or down vote on these amendments without interference. We would bring this whole debate to a close in no time. What did the Rules Committee do? It brought out a rule that sets an overall time limit of 14 hours for the remainder of this resolution. but it would allow for the same devious ma. neuvers we have been going through for the last 35 hoursamendments and counteramendmentsand no clearcut resolution of the salient issues. Consider if you will the first 10 hours under this new rule. Each amendment. and each amendment to an amendment. and so on. is given 30 minutes of debate. In other words. you could have three amendments pending to a base amendment at the same time for a total of 2 hours debate plus 20 minutes for every recorded vote. and none of those amendments needs even to have been in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I stress this. So for those of you who did bother to put your amendments in the RECORD. let me advise you now that chances are very likely your amendments for the most part will never see the light of day. Consider another possibility if you will. The Broomfield substitute made in order by the previous rule. the alternative which the administration supports. which calls for a meaningfal reduction. and I stress this. meaningful reduction. followed by a freeze. is given 2 hours under this rule with amendments to it getting 30 minutes each. But conceivably. just before those 2 hours expire. someone could come along with an entire substitute for the Broomfield amendment that would convert it to a profreeze version. and as time ran out the House could simply adopt this and even wipe out other amendments already adopted to the committee resolution. Would that not make a mockery of our 35 hours of work if those who complained about all of these amendments they amendedif they came along with the ""wipe out"" amendment on which no one had an opportunity to debate or amend? Well. that is not only possible under this rule. but I am told that there are amendments now floating around to accomplish just that. So where is the gamesplaying? This is what this great debate comes down to. This doubledealing. complex. restrictive gag rule being thrust out in the name of fairness and finality when all it really demonstrates is the ability of a majority to trample on minority rightawhen it has the numbers. This is not fair by any stretch of the imagination. but it certainly will be final. Let me turn to the implications of House Joint Resolution 13 itself because they are very trouliling to me and individuals who have had time and taken the time to study it. House Joint Resolution 13 even as amended during the Eeveral weeks of House debate has not been sufficiently improved to make it an acceptable arms control resolution. In its current form. it would force us. the United States of America. to forgo meaningful arms reduction. undercut the credibility of the nuclear deterrent upon which the free world depends. create serious verification difficulties and potentially raise questions about our stewardship of the free world. House Joint Resolution 13 would change the focus of the strategic arms reduction talks and the negotiations on intermediate range nuclear forces. from deep and equitable.reductions to a freeze at current. I stress that. current high and unequal levels. Hence it would block. not promote progress toward meaningful and equitable bilateral arms reduction. It is important to remember that it is not only we who have proposed that strategic and INF forces be reduced. the Soviets as well have proposed reductions. albeit different in content and size from those we have proposed. The negotiations are now in one of their toughest stages. But. significantly. they are negotiations to achieve substantial reductions. and I repeat reductions. as soon as possible. While House Joint Resolution 13 would permit simultaneous negotiations on a freeze and on reductions. the practical effect of House Joint Resolution 13 if enacted into law would be that the search for agreement on reductions would be abandoned in favor of negotiations about freezing current high and unequal levels of strategic forces and landbased longer range intermediate range nuclear forces. Our accepting of the asymmetries that result from a freezethe Soviet preponderance in strategic systems of 1.882 United States to 2.748 Soviet sys. tems. and Soviet monopolies in heavy ICBMs. (0 United States to 308 Soviets) and the LRINF missiles (0 United States. to 500 Soviet) undoubtedly would remove any incentive for the Soviets later to agree to reductions to equal and far lower force levels. In significant and substantial ways. House Joint Resolution 13 would undercut the credibility of our strategic deterrent and undercut NATOs abili ty to deter aggression without comparably reducing Soviet capabilities to threaten the Western deterrent. It would preclude necessary modernization of the U.S. strategic and INF forces. Almost all of the planned U.S. nuclear force modernization would have to be dropped. The B1 bomber. the Peacekeeper ICBM. the D5 SLBM. Pershing II missiles. and all three of our nuclear cruise missile programs. would be dropped. if this is carried out. In addition House Joint Resolution 13 would preclude the development. testing. production. and deployment of any U.S. nuclear or nonnuclear system which could threaten the viability of the Soviet seabased nuclear forces or stop Soviet nuclear bombers. This would force us at a minimum to cancel all future ASW and air defense programs."
980062376,Mr. Speaker. as you know. the majority - leadership is attempting to push through today a budget resolution which is not a responsible approach to the economic problems facing this Nation. Yesterday afternoon in the Rules Committee a rule was reported waiving the usual requirement that a conference agreement be available for 3 days before consideration of the rule. Thus many Members will not have an adequate opportunity to study the contents of the budget resolution nor will the American people have an opportunity in this short period of time to review it. The rule provides for 2 hours of debate. I might say if I had objected yesterday and offered an amendment we would be here today with only 1 hour of debate on 859 billion dollars worth of spending for fiscal year 1984. Also. Mr. Speaker. I think it is well to point out that in this budget resolution. buried deep. where not very much light can be shed upon it. there is a paragraph raising the level of the public debt. For fiscal year 1983 the level of the public debt would be $1.389.200.000.000 and for fiscal year 1984. $1.607.450.000.000. For fiscal year 1985 the appropriate level of the debt would be $1.804.000.000.000 and for 1986 $1.993.750.000.000. Mr. Speaker. we are not talking about small figures. We are talking about some large figures and some heavy expenditures and more debt for our grandchildren. Yet. we are only going to be talking about it here today under this rule for 2 hours. Mr. Speaker. as far as the rule otherwise is concerned. I have no objection to it. But the conference substitute is something that needs a lot of light today for the American people to understand it because it calls for $73 billion in new taxes over the 3 years. $12 billion in new taxes for fiscal year 1984. $15 billion in new taxes for fiscal year 1985. and $46 billion in fiscal year It also reverses a trend that was started 2V2 years ago to rebuild this Nations defenses. It will start us on a glidepath downward and certainly I think it is most important that we examine thoroughly what is happening to our defenses under this budget resolution. Mr. Speaker. I will have more to say about the resolution itself under the general debate on the resolution. Mr. Speaker. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi .
980103088,Mr. Speaker. this rule makes In order a somewhat controversial piece of legislation. even though it appears to be only a 45day extension of the Federal supplemental compensation. First. the 45day length of the extension creates problems. Such a short extension will be disruptive to the orderly administration of the program. The legislation does not merely extend the current Federal supplemental compensation program for 45 days but also establishes a new benefit structure. This new structure could well be rer vised again at the end of 45 days. At that time a new bill could be loaded down with additional. unnecessary. and unrelated spending. plus new taxes. A second problem with the 45day extension is that It hides the true cost of the Federal supplemental compensation program. The reserve fund portion of the first concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1984. passed by this House. Included $1.5 billion for a contemplated 6month extension of this program. whereas the bill before us today will cost $1.2 billion for 45 days. Now. I ask you. Mr. Speaker. what happened to this budget resolution that was passed and the $1.5 billion limitation that was anticipated fcr this program. Mr. Speaker. according to the informnation provided at the time of the Rules Committee meeting by the Office of Management and Budget. the administration strongly opposes this bill. The OMB estimates that if H.R. 3929 were to become an 18month extension of the Federal supplemental compensation program. it would cost $6 billion. Finally. 0MB concludes that if this bill were to reach the Presidents desk in its present form it would be recoinmended for disapproval. Mr. Speaker. like most rules from the Ways and Means Committee. this one restricts amendments. In this case no amendments will be in order except committee amendments and one nongermane amendment to be offered by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Yes. Mr. Speaker. you guessed It. When you talk about nongerinane amendments you talk about additional spending by this Congress. According to testimony presented in the Rules Committee the purpose of this amendment is to Increase the cap) on Federal title XX social setvices funds to $2.8 billion. effective October 1.. 1983. This Is a permanent increase in the title XX cap for fiscal yCears 1984 and 1985. The amendment Is printed In the RECORD of September 27. Mr. Speaker. we are going to hear a lot of rhetoric around this place in the next couple of days about all of the deficit financing that has been going on in the last few years. This type of legislation Is typical Of the type of legislation that has been getting us Into the deficit position that we are In. The rule provides a total of 2 hours of general debate plus 30 minutes of debate on the amendment by the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI. Mr. Speaker. I have no requests for time and I reserve the balance of miy time.
980160219,"Mr. Speaker. let me first of all commend the gentleman from California and the other Members who have taken the time and made the effort to bring this subject to the floor today. I do not think there is any subject that needs discussing and airing any more than does this subject. I was quite concerned over the weekend to pick up our hometown newspaper and to see how some of the reporters are writing on this subject. I cannot bring myself to believe that even on this subject. some do not seem to report accurately on what the debate is all about. I have in my hand an article out of the Bowling Green Centinal Tribune. my hometown newspaper. Saturday. March 3. 1984. I want to read you the first paragraph of a UPI story that shows some do not report accurately on what we are attempting to do and what the Members are attempting to do on the other side of this building. ""Washington (UPI). Amid some of the bitterest religious differences in decades. the Senate has taken up President Reagans proposal""-and this is what I want to emphasize-""to return Statesponsored prayer to the public schools."" H 1124 CO Somebody wrote that. And that somebody happens to be David E. Anderson from the UPI. Now. is that what we are discussing today? Is that what they are discussing in the Senate of the United States? Nol But lo and behold. such a story goes out across our land to the American people. that we are discussing a return to Stateoriented public prayer In our schools. Well. that Is not what we are talking about. We are not talking ae- it that. I have not heard a word about a Stateoriented prayer. have you? Not one single word. But somebody gets paid for writing this kind of material and putting it for consumption by the American people. What we are talking about is voluntaryvoluntaryprayer in the public schools. And it means exactly that. I have read the resolution that the gentleman from Ohio and many others have sponsored. And let me just read it. for the RECORD: Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group praycr in public schools or other public institutions. No person shall be required by the United States or by any State to particlpate in prayer. It does not say anything about a Statesponsored prayer. Absolutely not. So I think we ought to have in proper context what we are discussing here. We are talking about voluntary school prayer. not something sponsored by the State of New York. the State of Ohio. the State of Texas. the State of Pennsylvania. or the United States of America. We seek to give our children. the children of our country. the right to participate if they so choose in voluntary prayer in the public schools. .. It has already been alluded to that up above our Speaker and above the American flag are the words ""In God We Trust."" You know. those words were not always there. I can remember when those words went up there. Would you believe it. they went up after that Supreme Court decision was made denying our young children an opportunity to pray in the public schools? That is when they were put up. I was here. I was here. This House seemed to be defying the Court by its action you know. at a time it was thinking about Madelyn Murray. Incidentally. it has not been mentioned that Madelyn Murrays son who was involved in that lawsuit is now about the country saying that the decision was wrong. he has changed his position. But not so Madelyn. Yes. perhaps that first decision was a proper decision as far as Statesponsored prayers are concerned. We do not want anyone composing a prayer for our children. But certainly. certainly they ought to have the opportu-"
980174086,"Mr. Chairman. hopefully by tomorrow night the House will have adopted one of these substitutes and sent the matter over to the other body so that we can sit down in conference and come up with a budget that will be for the best of all Americans. I think one thing we cannot lose sight of during this debate is that the budget is only a framework for later action and regardless of which budgel is adopted. the individual votes day after day on appropriation bills in this House are what really count. Certainly we have seen Members vote on appropriation bills for more and more spending day after day. week after week. month after month. only to go out and say we have to do something about the deficit. Now. let us not kid ourselves about what we do when we pass a budget resolution. We do not hold down deficits merely by passing a budget resolution. As a member of the Rules Committee I know whereof I speak when I say the big spenders can always get a waiver from the 2to1 Democratcontrolled Rules Committee in order to spend beyond the Budget Act. What really counts is what happens on the floor of this House day after day on the bills which appropriate the money for every conceivable program or project known to man. Go back just to January 1 of thisyear and review some of the budget busters passed by this House this year. Certainly the United States is experiencing an economic revival which is the envy of a good many people in the Democrat ranks and one which is confounding most of the economists. Last year the economists were saying that it was a mysteriously average postwar recovery. Now all the evidence suggests it is an above average recovery and expansion. The good news that comes to hearten the marketplace has jolted the naysayers and the merchants of gloom. My Democratic friends who were glee. fully laying plans to use the the economy as an issue against the President and other Republicans this fall are now having to concoct other campaign issues. using the deficit demogoguery as a scare tactic to try to upset the psychology and the expectations of the credit market. for one. Is it working? No. it is not working. We see in America the free enterprise system really working for the benefit of Americans. We see an economic program that has brought expansion to this country. The productive power of American industry has. started reasserting itself. We have. taken off some of those bureaucratic regulations. As a matter of fact. the Federal Register last year was reduced abopt onethird in size. We see American industry flexing its muscles in many sectors of the economy as the upsurge in the gross national product indicates. Only yesterday there was a clamor by Democrats to borrow billions of dollars to be used to create leafrakingtype jobs when what was needed was to unfetter the American giant and let employed taxpayers keep a little more of their hardearned wages to buy goods and services they wanted. rather than to send their money to Washington to be distributed as Washington would like to distribute It. Since the recession. though. Republican economic policies have contributed to the creation of well over 4 million new jobs. Our Democratic friends just cannot admit the fact that we have a recovery. let alone its strength and the breadth of its base. Remember where we were when our former President. Jimmy Carter. left office? Remember 21.5percent Interest rates and 12.4percent inflation rates? I do not want to remember and I am sure the American people do not want to remember those high rates. Look around at the evidence of a rebounding economy as proof that these policies have started to turn this country around. Remember. this sustained economy is already 16 months old. Through January real personal income. meaning income left after adJusting for inflation. had risen $75 billion since the low of August 1982. With more income. Americans are spending more. In February retail sales were $106 billion. 23 percent above the recessional low of $86.5 billion. The first quarter real gross national product grevi by 7.2 percent according to preliminary estimates. well above. expectations and equal to CBO high"" growth baseline assumptions. Over a fivequarter interval. this is the strongest recovery sincetthat of 1961. Unemployment. which peaked at 10.7 percent in December of 1982. was down to 7.8 percent in February. exceeding all expectations. and omployment has increased by 4.9 millin over the same period. Unfortunately. in Ohio and other States which raised their taxes to gobble up the tax reductions given by the Reagan administration. we still have 2.5 to 3 percent more unemployment than the nation-. al average. In February employment increased in 70.2 percent of U.S. firms. Other February indexes that auger for a. bright economic future: a survey which projected the highqst 3month hiring rate in 5 years. The number of persons unemployed 15 weekis or longer had decreased 1.7 million since the depths of the recession. And since last December the number of laidoff workers had been nearly cut in ha f. February. reports showed an rspeclally satisfying turnaround in the automobile industry with uneant loyment falling in the year from 2411 to 5.4 percent. This industry had 238.000 more people working than at the low point of the recession. It was reported in February that domestic auto sales Increased to an 11.5 million annual rate. an increase of .7 percent from 1 year earlier. It was he first time in 4 years that automoboile sales had turned upward. The last years of the CarterMondale administration saw automobile sales drop without interruption. Auto plants Jire up to speed with the capacity utilha%tion doubling from recession lows of 35.8 to 82.2 percent. Certainly the American people u nderstand that if we had gone the liberal Democrat route and taken mc. re money in taxes from the American people and put it into leafraking jobs. these permanment type jobs woild not now be filled. Increased production in our factories are encouraging. They are operating at. their highest capacity levels in nearly 2V years. 80.7 percent in February. Now 92 percent of plant capacity idled in the redession has been brought back on line in 15 months up to February. Consider these other items that attest to the growing health of the American economy: new orders for manufactured goods rose 1.2 percent in January alone. following 1.6- and 2percent increases in December and November. respectively. In the. first month of the new year new orders for nondefense capital goods rose 2.3 percent. the best in 4 months. Manufacturers reported unfilled orders increased 1.6 percent in January. the 11th consecutive monthly increase. Firms are attempting to rebuild their inventories. A combination of low inventories. a high level of unfilled orders. and a record work week mean additional production and job gains ahead. The report on housing is equally gratifying. February housing starts more than doubled. reaching their April 4i 1984 1H12275 H 2276 CO highest point in 5 years. recording a 162 percent Increase from 840.000 in November 1981 to 2.197.000. Building permits in February more than doubledwith a 166percent increase from 730.000 in October 1981. to 1.941.000. January new home sales were up 106 percent. 688.000 versus 334.000 In September 1981. Also on the plus side. average monthly mortgage payments have risen only $4 under the Reagan administration. compared to the $342 rise between January 1977 and January 1981 ($256 to $598). Perhaps the best news of all is the throttling down of inflation. In the final 2 years of the CarterMondale administration it was. respectively. 13.3 and 12.4 percent. For all of 1982. it was 3.9 percent. For basic necessitieshousing. food. medical care. and energythe inflation rate was 3 percent in 1982in contrast to 17.4 percent in 1979 and 13.8 percent In 1080. both CarterMondale years. Since the poor spend a larger share of their money on these basics. they have been helped most by this dramatic drop during the Reagan administration. This administration has not been unmindful of the truly deserving who look to the Federal Government for help. It is estimated that the number of households receiving housing subsidies will rise from 3.253.000 in 1980 to 3.827.000 this year. And predictions are that the number of food stamp recipients. 20.200.000 in 1980. will climb to 20.540.000 this year. While it is thought that the number of medicald beneficiaries may drop slightly this year. to 22.700.000 from 22.881.000 in 1980. the number of medicare recipients is expected to show an Increase over the same period. from 27.273.000 in 1980. to 29.663.000 this year. and the number of civil servlee retirees- 1.712.000 In 1980is expected to reach 1.980.000 this year. Democrats have been saying ever since the economy turned around in late 1982 that the high interest rates would insure that the recovery would not last long. and that it would primarily be led and driven by consumption. In other words. the Reagan recovery would be a pure Keynesian. rather than a supplyside recovery in which investment in new plant and equipment play a prominent role in broadening the recovery. All of this gloom and doom has turned out to be wrong. Just 1 year ago CBO was forecasting real economic growth for 1983 at 3.9 percent. It turned out to be a 6.2 percent in its latest forecasta forecast by the way. upon which all of the alternative budget plans must be basedCBO shows first quarter real growth at 4.8 percent. whereas in fact the Commerce Departments flash figure for the first quarter is 7.2 percent. That is very close to CBOs socalled highgrowth alternative forecast of 7.3 percent. On the day that this flash estimate was released. I asked CBO to reestimate the deficits that would result from the rose garden budget plan if its more optimistic projections realized. The results were dramatic. Cumulative deficits from 198587 would be more than 25 percent lower. and deficits would be on a downward. rather than on a flat trajectory when better economic performance was assumed. Do you think that perhaps the Democrats may be deliberately using gloomy economic and deficit forecasts as a scare tactic to force both the large tax increases. and deep defense cuts. that they want? I would like to think that this is not the case. Perhaps the flash first quarter GNP estimate was just a flash in the pan. The data on the economy which came out since March 21 do not suggest that. On March 23. thq Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose by only 0.4 percent in February. On March 30. the Commerce Department reported that the Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose a strong 0.7 percent in February. suggesting a continuation of rapid economic growth. On March 30. it also was reported that new home sales surged 7.7 percent from January. On April 2. it was announced that factory orders in February rose 0.7 percent. suggesting large future gains in production. Embodied in this statistic was a 6.2 percent increase In spending on nondrfense capital goods. a major Indicator of business investment. In fact. contrary to what the Democratic doomsayers were predicting. investment spending has been a significant factor in the economic expansion. Yet. from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983. real nonresidential fixed investment rose 11 percent. or almost twice as fast as overall economic growth. This represents the strongest first y r of investment recovery since 1950. Finally. just yesterday was reported that spending for new onstruction surged 6.9 percent in Februarythe largest 1month increase since 1946. The facts show we are making progress but we must make more. Every person wanting a job should be able to find one. every family needing housing should be able to afford it. and every person needing food should have it. Until these things come to pass. we cannot rest on our laurels."
980236284,Mr. Speaker. I listened very carefully to the statement just made by the gentleman from Texas [Mr. FnosT]. and I find nothing wrong with it. Mr. Speaker. tnder this rule there will be 2 hours of general debate on the Trade Remedies Reform Act. No amendments can be offered. expect amendments recommended by the Ways and Means Committee. which will not be subject to amendment. Mr. Speaker. the bill made in order by this rule modifies -the remedies available to U.S. producers regarding unfair import competition. H.R. 4784 clarifies and expands the scope of the law to cover newer forms of unfair trade practices. such as foreign industrial targeting. upstream subsidies. natural resource subsidies. and downstream dumping. The bill provides several definitions and guidelines to govern the agencies responsible for administering these laws on such issues as threat of injury. cumulation of imports. and coverage of likely sales or leases. H.R. 4784 limits present discretion to terminate or suspend investigations on the basis of settlement agreements. The bill mandates several significant procedural changes to reduce the burdens on the agencies administering these laws. It establishes a centralized Trade Remedy Assistance Office in the International Trade Commission to assist industries in understanding and utilizing the many trade remedies available under U.S. law. It also mandates greater assistance to qualifying small busness in preparing and filing trade remedy petitions. It creates a Targeting Subsidy Monitoring Program in the International Trade Commission so that the Government will engage in a comprehensive and coordinated effort of monitoring and analyzing the industrial policies of our trading partners that may involve export targeting. Mr. Speaker. at the time of the Rules Committee meeting the Office of Management and Budget provided a statement of administration policy strongly opposing this bill unless it is amended to delete certain specified provisions. The administration is concerned that these provisions violate the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade and will be difficult or impossible to administer. Mr. Speaker. at this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota
980247383,"Mr. Speaker. in the Rules Committee meeting both the chairman and the ranking Republican member of the Committee on Appropriations agreed in requesting this rule. The Rules Committee gave them what they -asked. The rule waives the requirement that conference reports be available for 3 days before being considered on the House floor. In this case the conferees just worked out this agreement late last night and early this morning. However. one thing is clear and that is that the conference report is expensive. According to information provided to the Rules Committee this conference agreement provides a total of $5.817.318.000. This is $432.693.600 more than the Housepassed version. Mr. Speaker. the rule merely gives the House the right to consider the bill without the 3day layover. I support the rule for this reason but certainly will not support the bill itself as the amount provided is excessive. The amounts provided for herein are as follows: Second supplemental appropriations bill. 1984selected major items Food stamps ......................... Public Law 480..................... DODOperation and maintenance...................... HUDAssisted housing...... EPASuperfund ................. FEMAEmergency food and shelter ........................ Veterans programs..............

When we vote on the rule. we are not voting on the supplemental or on any of the individual programs in it. We are simply voting to bring the bill before the House for its consideration. I will vote ""yes"" and I urge my colleagues to do likewise."
980263732,"Mr. Speaker. I supported the Presidents compromise with Senate GOP leaders on a deficit reduction package earlier this year. and I still support that balanced approach to deficit reduction. This conference report does not ratify a balanced approach to deficit reduction. It exceeds the rose garden targets on defense savings and tax increases. but falls far short on restraining domestic spending. which accounts for 60 percent of the entire budget. I also cannot support this conference agreement because it ratifies year. to year increases in the deficit through fiscal year 1987. Let me point out that these high deficits are once again being supported by the Democratic majority of this House. The Presidents compromise with the Senate called for 3year outlay savings of $40.2 billion in defense and $43.2 billion in domestic spending. along with $48 billion in tax reform increases. As it evolved in the Senate. it also called for an important procedural enforcement that would prevent the annual exercise of taking money out of the defense budget for use in domestic appropriations accounts. By stipulating two appropriations caps. one for. defense and one for nondefense appropriations. it gave added teeth to a weakened budget process. The House was absolutely intransigent in even considering these caps at reasonable levels for the two sets of figures. and as a direct result the budget process came to a halt. Deficit reductions were passed in three separate bills. with defense savings and some nondefense discretionary savings now implied by the levels of funding in the continuing resolution on appropriations. In toto. they exceed the rose garden agreement by $18 billion in defense. and by $3 billion in taxes. But they fall short by $19 billion in domestic spending reductions by comparison with our earlier agree. ment. If we have supplemental appropriations next year they will fall short even further. Excluding the interest savings from these deficit reductions. which are passive in nature. hard to predict. and in any event are not direct policy actions we have voted to take to reduce the deficit. we have made a downpayment on the deficit this year of about $140 billion. measured against CBO baseline deficits of $589 billion. The deficits in this conference agreement today rise year by year. They do not fall. Let me read them to you: (Deficit In billions of dollars] iscal year. 1985 .................. ............ .... 181 1986 .................. .... . ........ ... 193 1987............... ............. ..... 208 When all is said and done. are those figures going to inspire confidence that we are able to manage our fiscal affairs in this Congress? I think not. As the Wall Street Journal reported last Thursday. ""either this budget process Is dead. or my watch has stopped."" In the 97th Congress. House Republicans along with Southern Democrats were able to pass back to back budget resolutions that had teeth in them. In toto we used reconciliation to cut spending by $159 billion below baseline from fiscal year 1982 to fiscal year 1985. in accordance with those two resolutions. These Republican efforts brought support from many conservative Democrats. In this 98th Congress. wih back to back partisan budget resolutions in the House written in the Democratic caucus. how much have we cut spending? Last years and this years reconciliation efforts as passed by the House saved a whopping $19 billion over the comparable 4 year span encompassed by two budget resolutions. In sum. the House Democrat leadership in this 98th Congress has presided over the decline of its very own budget process. a process used successfully by House Republicans in 1981 and 1982 when bipartisanship prevailed in this Chamber. I have noticed that the activity In the House Budget Committee has markedly declined in this Congress. Why bother to have this committee. and all its attendant expenses. it it only exists to rubber stamp a budget written in the Democratic caucus? The caucus blueprint was so vague this year that we could not mark up the budget in the traditional fashion. And there were no detailed computer runs of programmatic activity. as in the past. available for staff to compare the House position with the Senate position and the Presidents budget. The machinery bfoke down here in the. House. Unlike tbe- Senate we passed a blanket waiver of section 303.a. of the Budget Act. and allowed any and all appropriations bills reported out of committee to come to the floor. The majority was unwilling or unableit has never been made clear whichto provide us with data to see if those appropriations bills conformed to the House passed budget resolution. So we lost the ability to discipline ourselveii in our daytoday and weektoweek behavior here on the House floor. Bilis were not reported to the House floor under any set budgetary aggregates. In effect we reverted back to the days before the 1974 Budget Act was passed. That is the background leading up to today. October 1. the start of the 1985 fiscal year. We are today voting on the first and second budget resolution for fiscal year 1985. tasks we were supposed to complete by May 15 and September 15. respectively. With the sole exception of the conference report on the continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 1985. virtually all the individual committee actions Implied by it have already taken place. All we are doing is passively adding up what all the other committees of the House have done and have not restrained their appetites. This has been a budget process in reverse. The aggregate level of outlays in this conference agreement exceeds that in both the House passed and Senate passed versions of the first budget resolution. which were passed earlier this year without my support. Let me insert them for the record:"

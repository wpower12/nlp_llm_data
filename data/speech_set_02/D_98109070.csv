980023934,"Mr. Speaker. I am proud to join my distinguished colleagues today to honor the survivors of the Holocaust especially the many Tennesseans who were able to attend this extraordinary gathering. It is mans nature to put aside unpleasant thoughts. but this cannot be done with the Holocaust. Over the years we have sought explanations of the Holocaust. but the atrocities committed against the Jews defy all human rationality. The painful memory of the 6 million Jewish men. women. and children who died at the hands of the Nazi regime. should not and will not be forgotten. Today. this burden is eased somewhat as we honor 10.000 survivors of the Holocaust who gather in Washington. Their survival offers hope to many. We pay tribute to these Jews who have displayed unfailing bravery. courage and faith. Instead of converting their pain into more hatred and violence and instead of giving up on life. these survivors gather together to commemorate life and help ease the burden of the many family members and friends they lost in Europe. The death camp survivors have not stood idle and asked for our pity. Rather. they have overcome the obstacles and have gone on to raise families and become upstanding members of their communities. Despite the punishment invoked on them for being Jewish. they have not lost their faith in God or their Jewish identity. These Holocaust survivors also stand to teach us an important lesson about humanity. We must remember the horror of the Holocaust to assure that this terrible tragedy will never again occur. The unfortunate truth is that prejudice and ignorance continues today. The forthcoming Holocaust museum in Washington affords a valuable opportunity for our generation and future generations to study and better understand the Holocaust. Many of these survivors gathered here are still searching for answers as to how the Holocaust could ever occur. We must continue to admire their bravery. and strength and lend them our support. At the same time we must continue to mourn the loss of the many who perished. As we reflect on the meaning of this gathering it is apt to keep in mind the words of Ann Frank. who wrote in her diary a year before her death by the Nazis: ""Whoever is happy will make others happy too. He who has courage and faith will never perish in miseryl""e"
980037143,Mr. Speaker. I have introduced today into the House of Representatives a resolution to declare the week of June 12. 1983. as National Brick Week. Although it has become commonplace for the Members of this Chamber to offer such resolutions. we should not lose sight of the importance of honoring the marvelously diverse commodities which have proven the source of the Nations economic strength. As representatives to the National Legislature. it must be considered part of our service to those who have elected us to bring to national attention the contributions made to the country by the citizens and businesses of our home districts. Brick is among the oldest of building materials. Its presence throughout ancient and modern cultural history has made possible the construction of such imposing and varied structures as: Independence Hall and Carperters Hall in Philadelphia. Pa.. the New State House in Boston and the Old North Church in Concord. Mass.. and Monticello in Charlottesville and Governors Palace in Williamsburg. Va. Brickmaking and bricklaying are among the oldest professions. Even before the tine of Moses. history is replete with references to the production of brick and its use by skilled craftsmen and artisans. As may be seen from any tour of the cradle of the American Republic. our 18th and 19th century forefathers heavily relied upon brick as the foundation material for the construction of both the industrial North and the agrarian South. Into the 20th century. brick remains an important source of economic opportunity and a superior building product. Annually there are 10 billion brick manufactured in the United States. In my own State of Tennessee. there are 4 plants which account for nearly 5 percent of national production. Throughout the country nearly 500.000 people derive their livelihoods from the production and use of brick. The American brick industry is a uniquely domestic one which employs local resources and talents and which should be recognized for its importance to the Nation. Although it is to be Brick Week. it is less the inanimate product and more the people of the industry to whom we wish to pay honor with this resolution. The brick industry has been a leader in the search for increased building energy efficiencies. Working with officlals of the Departments of Energy. Defense. and Housing and Urban Development. the industry has sought to improve the durability. efficiency. and inhabitability of residential and commercial buildings while seeking ways to reduce construction costs. Representatives of the Brick Institute of America and the International Union of Bricklayers & Allied Craftsmen have consistently cooperated with the Congress and their consturction industry colleagues in the design of building research and regulatory programs that have resulted in substantial savings in building energy requirements throughout the Nation. Within recent years. recession has cut deeply into the commercial and residental construction markets. The dream of every American citizen to own their own home has been severely tested throughout these past years. In response. the brick industry has sought new ways to reduce the cost and maintenance of structures. while increasing building durability. Whether in the construction of new towns in the South or the rehabilitation of the older industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. the brick industry has sought ways to improve the built environment. Through union training programs or manufacture and design innovations. the industry has sought to improve the quality of its product and the skill of its application while increasing the Nations inventory of affordable and durable structures. The people of the brick industry are known to all of us in whose district brick is manufactured. distributed. or applied. Its members are local and national business. labor. civic. and religious leaders. their personal and economic contributions are important to their communities. Although lower interest rates are important for continued recovery. they are no more important than high spirits and the continued dedication of this important segment of the construction industry to improving Americas built environment. Mr. Speaker. it is important and just for the Congress to recognize the achievements of the brick industry and its people. I believe that my resolution will provide such recognition and serve to tell the Nation of a job welldone. I ask for the support of my House colleagues in the dedication of the period of June 12 to 18. 1983. as National Brick Week.
980043108,"Mr. Speaker. I yield 30 minutes to my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from Kansas . pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. on April 26. 1983. the Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously adopted a resolution finding Ms. Rita Lavelle in contempt of Congress for failing to appear and testify on March 21. 1983. as called for by a subpena of the committees Subcommittee on Oversight and Invesitgations. The subpena was issued by the subcommittee in connection with its longstanding and ongoing investigation into the implementation of the Comprehensive Environmental. Response. Compensation. and Liability Actcommonly known as Superfund. Superfund became law in late 1980. and since then. no one has had more important responsibility and stewardship for the administration and implementation of the act than Ms. Lavelle. former Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. And no one has had a better vantage point from which to observe defects in the act than Rita Lavelle. The subcommittee subpena was authorized on February 10. 1983. by a majority of the Members voting. without any dissent. and with a majority being present. Ms. Lavelle was personally served with the subpena on February 23. 1983. and she failed to appear on March 21. as required. On March 21. 1983. the Oversight Subcommittee approved. without objection. a resolution which found her in contempt and directed that the subcommittees finding be referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce for such action as the committee deemed appropriate. A detailed chronology is included in the committees report. As the oversight arm of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Oversight and. Investigations is concurrent with that of the parent committee. Under rule X. the Oversight Subcommittee is charged with the responsibility to ""review * * * the application. administration. execution. and effectiveness of those laws * w * "" within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and to oversee the ""operation of the Federal agencies * * having responsibilities for the administration and execution"" of the laws within our jurisdiction. In addition. the Oversikht Subcommittee is required to ""study and conditions or circumstances which may indicate the necessity or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation"" within the jurisdiction of the committee. The charge of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and the authority upon which the subpena rests have their foundation in the Constitution. The authority of the Congress to obtain information is clear from Article I of the Constitution and from interpretation of that power by the Supreme Court. The Court has stated that the power of Congress to conduct investigations ""encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes ** * It comprehends probes into departments of the Federal Government to expose corruption. inefficiency. or waste."" (Watkins against U.S.) The Oversight Subcommittees involvement in finding solutions to the problems presented by hazardous waste has been significant and longstanding. The subcommittee held approximately 30 hearings and issued 3 reports on the subject of hazardous waste disposal since October 1978. The subcommittees comprehensive report on hazardous waste disposal in late 1979 played a major role in spurring enactment of the Superfund legislation. which came out of Mr. FLoRIos legislative subcommittee. Another report by the subcommittee in late 1979 documented its own survey of waste disposal sites. The survey. which constituted the first national survey of its kind. identified 3.383 disposal sites used since 1950 by the 53 largest domestic chemical companies. Approximately 2.000 of those sites were previously unknown to EPA. and the Agency thereafter began its own survey of waste sites. The current investigation is an important one and the subcommittee long ago arrived at the point where the testimony of Ms. Lavelle was critical to effective pursuit of its inquiry. Serious allegations have been raised that she subordinated public trust to the pressures of industry and the vicissitudes of politics. Concerns have been voiced that certain policies and procedures were instituted by senior management officials which delayed the effective implementation of the Superfund program. Her testimony is essential to the subcommittees review of the law. the procedures. their Implementation and of Federal enforcement actions to require cleanup of hazardous waste sites by responsible parties and to recover Federal cleanup costs from responsible parties. Ms. Lavelles failure to testify is not the first difficulty encountered by the subcommittee during the course of th!i investigation. Other attempts to obstruct the subcommittee have also been made. They have all been unsuccessful. The two most egregious examples were the refusal to turn over EPA documents subpenaed by the subcommittee and the refusal to permit unfettered interviews of EPA employees. As the committee knows. the subecmmittee ultimately received all of the documents it subpenaed. and eventually heard the uninhibited testimony of numerous EPA employees during a series of executive sessions. It is regrettable that we have reached this point in our attempt to hear the testimony of Ms. Lavelle. She alone. among the many EPA employees from whom testimony was requested. has refused to cooperate with the subcommittee. It is clear to this Member that If Ms. Lavelle would have appeared and testified. her constitutional rights . would have been fully and vigorously protected by the chairman of the committee. Ms. Lavelles refusal to honor a duly authorized subpena is an act of defiance to the legitimate authority of the Congress. We are a Nation of laws. No one person can be above the law. particularly when that person has been privileged to serve in a position of high trust. In conclusion. I would note that this is not a partisan issue. The committee report contains strong and supporting supplemental views. I would urge my colleagues to vote for the committees resolution. and in so doing. to reaffirm the prerogatives of this body."
980075203,Mr. Chairman. this is a proposal to reduce the amount of money authorized for procurement of MX by $350 million and to reduce the number of missiles procured in this bill from 27 to 21. It is designed to send a dial signal from the Congress. One signal is to the President. It says that we will support having this missile potentially ready for deployment in late 1986 or early 1987. as now scheduled. but we take very seriously your statement of flexibility as to the numbers of MX ultimately needed. and we are indicating by our vote to reduce the funding for procurement. a desire to move slower rather than faster through the deployment of this missile. and we are indicating a preference for lower rather than higher numbers of MX missiles in the end. moving closer to 50 than to 100 by the current FOC date. As for te Soviets. our message would be substantially the same. with one twist. Soviet failure to negotiate seriously or a Soviet decidion. for example. to create a world crisis over the first deployment of the Pershing II rather than to keep bargaining would not be in the interest of peace and stability. These are things which can and will influence the temper of the American people and the U.S. Congress. What we hold back. we can expedite: what we restrict. we can expand. what may not suit us about this particular weapon system. we can satisfy elsewhere. The Congress is going along with the President. but only on condition that he make good on his commitment to aim for an outcome in arms control that reflects a mainline American consensus. The Congress is also putting the Soviets on notice to take advantage of a time. a mood. and an offer that are perishable. Finally. the reason for this amendment is to underscore our absolute intention to deploy a force of MX missiles well below the firststrike threshold. There has been some disagreement over the implications of a combined force of MX missiles and D5 missiles and Minuteman III equipped with the Mark 12A warhead. This amendment seeks to clarify those numbers. to make absolutely certain that we are well below that firststrike threshold.
980133964,"Mr. Chairman. I have the greatest respect for my colleaigue. lhe gentleman from Iowa . but no Member of this body shouid have any misunderstanding abotut the tact that this amendment is the key amniidmient. anid this represents the key vote on this entire bill. If Members vote for this amendinenlt. they are voting to completely gut thle effort to stop as much of tile telephone rate increase as this Coni""ess is capable of stopping. Nowt. let us be candid: Because of mafny events. some of them starting long ago and just concluded by this D~cpartment of Justice and some in the FCC developed by this administrations appointees to the Federal Coinnmunications Commission. for a lot of reasons. it will be impossible for all of the proposed rate increases to be avoidled. Buit If we want to do the best we can to avoid as much of the rate Increases as possible. we should vote against this amendment and vote In fa vor of thle pending legislation. if. on the other hand. Members vote in favor of this amendment anti vote to gut this legislation. then they will bear responsibility for the telephone rate icases which are going to come ne.ft year. If they want to do something about those increases. then they should support the legislation and should by all means defeat this amendment. Mr. Chairman. what is the Issue here? The issue here is really something called joint cost allocatlon. That sounds complicated. but it really is not complicated. Let me give thle Members a simple illustration. If the gentleman from lowa anid I together bought an auitomobile and he was going to use It four days a week and I was going to use it 3 days a week and we decided that we would share the payments to the bank. we would have allocated thle joint cost of that automobile between us because we were both using the automobile. Now. if. after a year or so. the pattern of usage changed and I found that I was using thle automobile only 2 days a week. on weekends. and the gentleman from Iowa was using it five days a week. if I then went to my friend and said. ""Look. I am not using this car- as much as. I used to. and you are going to need it anyway. Why do not you pay all of the bank payments. 100 percent. and let me pay nothing anid let me keep using the car 2 days a week for free?"" That would not seem fair and just. But that Is exactly what AT&T is trying to say to the local telephone companies. Together. the long distance business and that local telephone business jointly built a telephone system which has been and remains thle greatest in the world. An essential part of that system is that local telephone loop. Always in the past the cost of that total telephone loop has been shared both by local customers and by longdistance ctustomers. Both of them uts the local telephone loop. After all. we cannot make a longdistance telephone call unless we first originate it on local telephone lines and poles and then take it through the longdistance system and then complete the call through another extensive set of local telephone lines and poles. At the current time longdistance callers pay a share of the cost of that equipment and those lines anid poles that they use. Now. for years there have been arguments that long distance was paying too much of that cost. The word. ""subsidy"" has been used. Well. of course. the percentage that they pay is going to come down In any event. Under the legislation. it Is going to come down. But I wonder how many of my colleagues realize how radical and extremist a plan the FCC has come up with that this legislation Is trying to prevent. The FCC. incredibly. has decided that 100 percent of those local costs for lines and poles ought to be paid by the local ratepayers. anid that the longdistance business and longdistance callers ought to use all of those lines and poles fur free without paying anything for the use or those lines and poles. Now. tell tie about the word ""subsidy."" What that plan would result In is a subsidy by local ratepayers for thle longdistance businesses. That would let t.he longdistance businesses use these lines and poles for free."
980179319,"Mr. Speaker. the people of Tennessee and. indeed. of this entire Nation have suffered a great loss in the death of former Representative Joe L. Evins. For 30 years. Congressman Evins served as a Member of this body. From the time he was first elected to Congress on November 5. 1946. until the day he retired. he dedicated himself to fulfilling the needs of the people of this Nation. While in Congress. he served as chairman of the Public Works Appropriations Subcommittee and of the Committee on Small Business. Through his devoted committee work and his persistent efforts. he became known as a champion for the common man. However. Congressman Evips did not exclusively concern or commit himself to any single group. He sought to reach all of the Nation by pushing for a plan he called the building of America. To Joe Evins. building America meant providing hospitals for those in need of medical care. building libraries to give people theopportunity to read and to educate themselves. supporting irrigation projcts for the West. and building TVA dams to control flooding and to provide electricity for the South. Even though these were the areas of major national concern. Congressman Evins continually sought to extend his philosophy. that public works projects are an investment in the American people. to all areas of American livelihood. Congressman Evins knew that the people of the United States were the backbone of this great Nation. and he encouraged us to work for progress. He was a strong force behind the model cities program to upgrade our towns and to enhance the quality of life for urban residents. He was also a staunch supporter of science and technology because he felt these areas represented American ingenuity and were the keys to progress in the future. He pushed for medical research and experimentation. for the development of new fabrics. and for the construction of new building materials. Furthermore. he sought to broaden our horizons by supporting the space program. and in acknowledgement of his unyielding support. a plaque bearing his name rests on the moon. Even though Congressman Evins was an important and influential man here in Washington. he never lost touch with the people back home. As he walked quickly down the Halls of the Capitol. he was often greeted by. ""Good morning. Mr. Chairman."" yet in his hometown of Smithville. Tenn.. it was merely. ""Hi Joe."" He came to Washington as a Representative and never forgot the people of the upper Cumberland regionhe himself was one of us. Born on a farm in DeKalb County. Tenn.. he was a deeply religious man whose honor and integrity were never questioned. He graduated from Vanderbilt University and from Cumberland Law School in the early 1930s. He served as an Army attorney in Europe. reaching the rank of major by the wars end. After the war. he first ran for the congressional seat he was to hold for 30 years under six Presidents. Throughout his years. Congressman Evins sought to bring Government to the people. In 1963. he authored ""Understanding Congress"" because he felt Congress needed to be strengthened and better understood. since it was ""the bulwark of democracy."" He worried about waste in Government and about a system which ventured to far from commonsense ideals. Fortunately. he never lost sight of what he believed were the basic cornerstones of Americas greatness: The spirit of America. the Constitution. education. our religious heritage. and the community concept of neighbors helping neighbors. Congressman Evins retired on top in 1976. having never lost an election. Throughout his tenure here. he had always been known as a hard worker and a devoted family man. He had come to Washington to represent the people of his district. and when he retired. he fittingly went back home to the district and people he loved most. Many Congressmen on both sides of the aisle have benefited from his wise advice. Certainly I. as many of you. have sought his counsel many times through the years and feel that I have lost both a good personal friend and a mentor in the death of Joe Evins. His integrity and hard work were shining examples to all of us who knew him. His devotion to his family. his district. and to the people of this Nation were unparalleled. Today we mourn the loss of Joe L. Evins. but we will always remember his compassion and his accomplishments for the people of this country. Mr. Speaker. I include for the RECORD an article from the Smithville Review. FORMER CONGRESSMAN JOE EviNs DIEs Former U.S. Representative Joe L. Evins who represented Tennessee in Congress for three decades. died Saturday at 8:17 a.m. in Vanderbilt Hospital. Nashville. after an 11day stay. He was 73. A native of DeKalb County. Evins had suffered three heart attacks. most recently in February 1982. He retired after his 15th term in Congress in 1976. saying he wanted to spend more time with his family and wanted to ""quit on top"". While in office. his power was unequaled among the states house delegation. Countless buildings. bridges. dams. sewer projects. airports and other public facilities. and millions upon millions in federal funds came to this area through Joe L. Evins. whose power in Washington and popularity at home was so great he held the office 30 years. with little or no opposition and with the approval and respect of people from both political parties. It was Evins. in fact. who persuaded President Lyndon Johnson to pour millions in federal funds to small towns rather than large cities when Johnson first came up with the idea for Model Cities. a program which is often credited with bringing Smithville into the 20th century as a leading city in the Upper Cumberland. Submitting Johnsons proposal of federal funds to aid four or five large cities wouldnt get far in Congress. the powerful Evins told Johnsons men. But a program to aid medium and small cities would draw a broad base of support. he said. * Smithville and neighboring Cookeville were two of the approximately 150 locals in the nation that went on to enjoy the Model Cities boost in the arm in the following years. Representing a rural and small town district as he did. Evins was one of the most effective and influential spokesmen for agricultural and small business interests in the House. and devoted much of his energy to promoting a governmental atmosphere favorable to the preservation of that fastvansihing phase of American existence. Despite his many years in Washington. Evins remained pretty much a country boy himself. While he was still a small child. his family moved into town. to a twostoried brick colonial house built by his grandfather in 1889. The house was only three blocks from the DeKalb County Courthouse and his father. J. Edgar Evins. was a magistrate for 35 years and mayor of Smithville for 15 years. so young Joe sort of grew up around the courthouse. The elder Evins was a businessman. banker and political power in Smithville for decades. He was a state Senator. a member of the state Democratic executive committee. a building contractor responsible for construction of many of the towns major buildings and for 24 years operator of Consoldiated Bus Lines. which ran a transportation network from Chattanooga and Knoxville to Nashville and into Kentucky. In DeKalb County High School. he belonged to the 4H Club and the Theta Epsilon Literary Society. was business manager for the schools student newspaper. Spunk. and was a member of the school debating team. The high school organized its first football team in 1926. and Evins landed a spot on the team as left end. although he weighed only 135 pounds. when the star left end broke his arm. But when we entered Vanderbilt University. the team of Coach Dan McGugin had an ample supply of heavier left ends with sound arms. so Evins became the team manager. At Vanderbilt. he was a member of Phi Kappa Sigma. a social fraternity. and Phi Delta Phi. a legal fraternity. and was a member of the sophomore Wise Owl Club. president of the PreLaw Club and assistant editor of the college annual. In his senior year. he was elected to the Commodore Club. an honorary club composed of 12 members chosen for student leadership. Upon his graduation from Vanderbilt with a bachelors of arts degree in 1933. Evins turned down an offer to become clerk and master of DeKalb County Chancery Court and. instead. entered Cumberland University Law School in Lebanon. where he graduated in 1934. He took his law degree back to Smithville. hung out his shingle. and married Ann Smartt. daughter of Circuit Court Judge R. W. Smartt of McMinnville. who was teachIng school in Smithville. Evins father was for many years a political power in the congressional district and. through his influence. young Evins was offered a job in Washington by Ewin L. Davis. chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and a former Tennessee congressman. The job. said Davis. was temporary. dependent upon the availability of.funds. but Evins rose in three years to the post of assistant secretary of the agency and was still with the FTC when World War II broke out. ""I figured someone else could do the job."" said Evins. ""I quit and volunteered for the Army."" Meanwhile. during his tenure with the PTC. Evins pursued postgraduate legal studies at George Washington University. During the war. Evins rose to the rank of major in the Judge Advocate Generals Department. spending his first two years of military service in Washington and two more years in England. France and Germany. During his last year in England. 1944. Evins was qualified as his fathers opponent in the Democratic primary for the state senate from his threecounty 12th District. The elder Evins withdrew and his son received the nomination. but after the primary. Joe Evins withdrew in his turn. and his father was nominated and elected. On his return from overseas. Evins began to receive a great deal of encouragement from friends in the district to become a soldiercandidate for Congress in the old 5th District. ""I didnt need much."" he said. ""I became GI Joe. soldierlawyer and candidate for Congress."" He wasnt conceded much chance against the oneterm incumbent. Rep. Harold H. (Doc) Earthman of Murfreesboro. but he won handily. and from that time on was never seriously challenged as representative of the sprawling district. Even after many years in the House. one of his friends called Evins ""a remarkable combination of political naivete and political shrewdness."" but the naivete had very much the upper hand when he reported as a new member of the House along with such other freshmen as John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. Eager and self confident. he asked a colleague one day if he would yield the floor so Evins could speak on a TVA appropriations bill. ""Yes."" answered his colleague. ""if the gentlemen has anything to offer."" ""I learned then. ""Evins said later. ""that it takes time to get your spurs."" He learned. too. what committees are for. Trying to help his friend. Rep. J. Percy Priest of Nashville. get money for a new Veterans Administration hospital. he topped up on the floor and offered an amendment. It was voted down immediately. Later. working through a committee. he succeeded in getting through an amendment providing $10 million for the hospital. As an exserviceman. l!e was appointed to the Veterans Affairs Committee upon his entry in Congress. and he learned there that (a) legislation without appropriation is useless and (b) appropriations are controlled in committee. : With that in mind. he made inquiries and learned that his colleagues considered Rep. Clifton A. Woodrum of Virginia. chairman of the Appropriations Committees independent offices subcommitteee. one of the few most influential men in the House Evins set his eye on the Appropriations Committee. When Rep. Albert Gore Sr. of Cordell Hulls old 4th District. father of the present congressman. went up to the Senate In 1952. Evins had his chance. He became Gores successor in the 4th. because his own 5th District and Gores 4th were combined in a reapportionment law. and Evins was elected to represent the new 4th. More important to Evins personal career. he succeeded to the spot Gore relinquished on the House Appropriations Committee. Later. he followed Woodrum as chairman of the independent offices subcommittee. but gave up that chairmanship early In 1971 to become chairman of the public works subcommittee. Evins also served on the House Armed Services Committee and the Small Business Committee during his tenure in the House. and for 12 years was chairman of the latter committee. His interest in the small businesses typical of his congressional district caused him to devote particular %itention to the Small Business Committee. where he succeeded to the membership held by the late Estes Kefauver when Kefauver advanced to the Senate in 1948. * In 1955. Evins was named chairman of a subcommittee to find out whether the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies had become ""puppets"" of the executive branch of the government. and in 1959 he was appointed head of a special ""watchdog"" subcommittee to ride herd on the Small Business Administration. He also served as chairman of the House Committee on Personnel and Patronage. which handles about 500 job appointments. including Capitol Hill pages. clerks and police officers. Sometime before his retirement. Evins had emerged as one of the top 20 members of the House in influence and power. and some insiders ranked him among the top 10. In his early 60s. he had achieved heights usually reserved for a handful of congressmen in their 70s. and there was talk that one day he might become Speaker of the House. a Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity. along with my colleagues. to pay tribute to former Congressman Joe L. Evins. who recently passed away. Congressman Evins was first elected in 1946 and served with distinction until his retirement in 1977. I was privileged to serve with him for 14 of those 30 years. He chaired the House Committee on Small Business and was instrumental in the creation of the Small Business Administration. He was a champion of small businessmen. and his efforts in their behalf will long be remembered. He was known as a man who could get things done. not only for his constituents in the Fourth District of Tennessee. but throughout this great Nation. In his positions on the House Appropriations subcommittees. he was dedicated to funding projects in every Statefollowing his plan he called ""the building of America."" Congressman Evins was justifiably proud of his accomplishments directly benefiting his district and the State of Tennessee. He was responsible for bringing hospitals. schools. airports. and highways into the Fourth District. and he helped get the funding for the Veterans Administration Hospital in Nashville. Though we sat on opposite sides of the aisle. I have to say I admired him for his commitment to serving his constituents. When I first came to Washington as a Member of this body in 1963. I immediately became aware of his tremendous reputation for both individual constituent service had his skillful use of his senior legislative position on national issues. He became something of a role model for many new Members. particularly on his side of the aisle. He may never have realized how many freshmen set out to follow down the path he established. He was the dean of our delegation for a number of years. Being in that position myself. now. and looking back at the changes in our State over the years. I marvel at the impact his career had on the State and its residents. Times have changed. both here in Washington and in Tennessee. They have changed. in part. because he helped them changeall for the better. His is a name that will be longremembered both in the State he loves so well. and on Capitol Hill. In that. we can see the true measure of his life on this Earth.e"
980184427,Mr. Chairman. I would like to rise in support of H.R. 5172. and to congratulate my friend. Mr. WALGREN. chairman of the subcommittee. Chairman FuQUA. and ranking minority member. Mr. WINN. for their excellent work in creating this bill. and I urge my colleagues to support it. In particular I would like to address one component of the bill which has been sponsored by myself and the gentleman from New Mexico . the ranking minority member of the subcommittee. has resulted from the work of my Subcommitteee on Investigations and Oversight. All of us have read about failures of buildings and bridges throughout the United States that resulted from failures in their structural design. Examples such as the collapse of a walkway at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City. or the failure of a bridge along interstate 95 in Connecticut are well known. Moreover. in many of our districts we know of some building or bridge that collapsed long before it should have. In its investigation of these structural failures. the subcommittee did not seek to assess blame In any particular case but rather sought to identify generic causes and factors responsible for these failures. The most alarming of the findings is that there is no mechanism for learning from our past mistakes. Results from the investigation of a failure usually just end up in the files of a law firm or Insurance company. or are sealed from the public aitogether in the litigation settlements. Without some public access and a central repository for this data. the professionals involved in architecture. engineering. and construction do not have easily accessible technical data on the causes of the collapse and they cannot use the data to avoid making similar mistakes. Section 307 of this bill charges the Bureau of Standards with maintaining this repository. an idea which has been widely endorsed by the professional community. Section 307 also gives the Bureau the statutory authority to conduct Investigations of major structural failures. This is not new. it merely gives the Bureau statutory authority to execute a function it has been carrying out for 15 years already. The Bureau has made a number of investigations of major failures throughout the country. which have been enormously helpful in preventing their repetition. Section 307 does not give Bureau regulatory or police powers. All language that would have preempted the authority of local and State authorities was purposefully left out of the II13096 amendment. Moreover. the report to accompany H.R. 5172 makes it clear that the committee intended that these investigations of structural failures be done in full cooperation with State and local officials. Lastly. the Bureau is not required to undertake any investigation. the decision of whether or not to investigate is left to the discretion of the Director of the Bureau of Standards. Section 307 is widely endorsed and recognizes the excellent and helpful role the Bureau has been performing.*
980199958,"Mr. Chairman. first of all let me explain why I am offering this amendment. This is essentially the BrownCoughlin amendment. It has minor changes in the wording and its principal purpose is to insure that the first vote which occurs will be on the essence of the BrownCoughlin amendment. Now. let me speak to the merits of this issue. I urge my colleagues to listen. those who are in their offices watching on television. I think this is one of the most important arms control votes in this Congress or in any other Congress. I implore you as a Member who has worked long and hard on arms control issues and as one who has worked with the administration when I felt the administration was right. I believe the administration is wrong on this antisatellite question. We have here in essence a failsafe point. If we cross this threshold. then the sky is the limit. It is ""Katie. bar the door."" Why? Because the strategic satellites are perhaps the most stabilising element in the nuclear arms race today. They give both sides the ability to see and hear what is going on in the other country. We can monitor testing programs.. We can see their ICBM sites. We can see when they launch missiles and when they test missiles. And. I might add. we in the United States have a much more elaborate and sophisticated and valuable capability in space than does the Soviet Union. It is to our advantage to have a ban on systems that threaten satellites. Now. much has been made of the fact that the Soviet Union has tested a system. The United States tested a system. We have conducted more tests than the Soviet Union has. a cumbersome system that would explode Soviet satellites. We dismantled it. We dismantled it several years ago. Their system is very primitive and very cumbersome. It relies on explosive devices. It can only get at lowaltitude systems. The F15 system which we are prepared to test against an object in space has the ability to be upgraded without the Soviet Union finding out about the upgrading. It is nonverifiable. It has the ability to be upgraded to threaten not only the lowaltitude satellites. but also the very highaltitude satellites upon which stability depends. Do not vote for the McCurdy amendment. My colleague is an excellent Member who is well intentioned. but his amendment is based on the wrong premise. He would allow the administration to go forward with what it wants to do when the chief problem is. at least on this case. that the administration has said that it does not want to even talk to the Soviets about weapons in space or about the ability to get a treaty there. Do not vote for the Byron amendment. again a wellintentioned effort. but again it is based on the wrong premise. We have a qualitative leap frog problem here. not a simple numerical effort to have the exact number of tests. It is a different system with different capabilities. Vote for the BrownCoughlin amendment. The first vote will occur on the BrownCoughlin amendment. in essence. Now. in microcosm. this issue really represents the fundamental challenge of our times. Are we going to be up to the task of arms control or are we going to surrender to the inexorable march of technology and when one side getE some new technological development. do we automatically have to get one better than them. no matter whether or not it pushes us beyond any capability to have verifiable arms control? If we are going to stop the nuclear arms race. we have got to be willing to assert arms control prerogatives and say that technology does not always come first. Stability comes first and when we have a technological development that we know threatens all future arms control efforts. we have a responsibility in this Congress to speak out and say no. let us stop it. We have an opportunity to have a moratorium. Let us vote for the BrownCoughlin amendment"
980263472,Mr. Speaker. I could make do with 2 minutes. but I want to spend part of the additional minute bragging on the chairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the full committee. I hope my colleagues in this body on both sides of the aisle recognize and fully appreciate how valuable a contribution has been made by the gentleman from Colorado. not only on this bill but on the whole broad area of communications policy. We are in the midst of an unprecedented revolution in communications. and we are fortunate indeed to have such distinguished leadership on these issues from the gentleman from Colorado. Here again on this legislation he has brought legal order out of legal chaos. We are going to see tremendous benefits for the cable industry. for all facets of the communications industry and. most importantly. for the American people as a result of this legislation. Where the chairman of the full committee is concerned. once again. I hope my colleagues have noticed that there has been a long series of bills involving delicate and complex negotiations between industry groups that have been at loggerheads for years and Chairman DINGELL has forced them to sit down and work out their differences and allow the public interest to shine through. and he has done so again on this legislation. I want to specifically thank Chairman WaRTH for his leadership in helping me produce a difficult but fair compromise on the issue of home satellite Earth stations. This bill removes the legal cloud that has been hovering over the reception of signals from satellites by people with home dishes. It is a good compromise that protects the interests of programmers and protects and promotes the interest. of the many hundreds of thousands of rural Americans who are buying satellite dishes because they are the only way they have to participate in this magnificent telecommunications revolution. Over the past several days and throughout the weekend my staff and Chairman WIRTHs staff have worked with the programming industry and with the satellite dish industry. and as a result the provisions of this bill will promote the public interest in ensuring that the dramatic. indeed revolutionary. growth of the satellite home Earth station industry is going to continue to accelerate. In only 3 or 4 years we have seen 600.000 home satellite Earth stations installed here in the United States. In April of next year this industry will pass the 1 million mark and I predict that before the end of the century this method of receiving television signals is going to be a technology of choice. There are approximately 125 channels available to someone with one of these Earth stations. Mr. Speaker. I would like to congratulate Chairman WIRTH and Chairman DINGELL on the completion of the difficult and arduous task of bringing about the cable legislation contained in H.R. 4103. I am particularly pleased that the legislation now incorporates many of the concepts concerning home Earth station satellite viewing contained in H.R. 5176. The Satellite TV Viewing Rights Act of 1984 which I introduced on March 19. 1984. along with Congressman TAUzIN and Congressman RosE. I am pleased that H.R. 5176 has the bipartisan support. at this time. of 27 cosponsors and would like unanimous consent to insert their names in the RECORD. As you know. many Americans cannot view programs that many cable subscribers receive including coverage of the U.S. Congress. broadcast superstations. movie and sports channels. religious channels and others. However. thousands. of families every month are now purchasing satellite Earth stations to view such programs. Recently this activity has been challenged in a Federal court in Wichita. KS. where. in the case AirCapital Cablevision. Inc. against Starlink Communications Group. Inc.. a dealer that sells satellite Earth stations was sued by the local cable company for allegedly violating section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934. It is important to clarify the law on this important area of satellite communications to the home and by doing so we are not meaning to pass judgement on any case that was or was not decided in the past under section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934. Nor are we passing judgment on any acthitis or programs not specified in the legislation. It is also my understanding that the provisons of H.R. 4103 concerning home satellite Earth station vewing of cable programing are not meant to change any copyright law under title 17 of the United States Code or any rule. regulation or order thereunder. or any other such law. It is also my understanding that the provision of section 5 of H.R. 4103 also permits the marketing of programs to home Earth station userseven if the transmissions are not encoded or scrambledif a good faith marketing program is in place. This is based on the representations of the satellite Earth station industry in congressional testimony and elsewhere of the general willingness to pay for programs for which a charge is made by the programmer. The intention of the legislation is not to force programmers to establish a marketing program for home Earth stations but to make it clear that nothing in the legislation is meant to foreclose the establishment of a marketplace for the selling of such programming to home Earth station users in negotiations between the parties. It is also my understanding that the legislation anticipates that if programmers want to enter into such a marketing system. it must be done in good faith and not as a mechanism to deny home viewing of the satellitedelivered television programming. It is also my understanding that manufacturers. lealers or distributors cannot be forced into paying a tax or royalty on the sale of equipment under this legislation. The program providers and the satellite Earth station industry could certainly cooperate in arranging a pointofsale licensing plan as a means nf fulfilling any obligation that may arise of a home Earth station user to pay for programming.

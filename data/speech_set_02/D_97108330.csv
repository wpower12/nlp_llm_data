970007443,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce a bill which is designed to enhance the medical care provided to a new classification of veteran beneficiaries. This bill will: Offer priority treatment lit Vetorans Administration hospitals to active duty members of the armed serviees who are wounded in combat uinder contingency or wartime situations. H.R. 1969. the Military Casualty Medical Treatment Planning Act of 1981. authorizes the Veterans Adniinistration to provide medical care Onl a priority basis to members of the uniformed services who are injured during a period of war or national emergency. It would aid substantially in eliminating anticipated shortfalils iii DOD medical facilities in lime event that the U.S. forces are .sigaged in largescale hostilities. either in a declared war or in a contingency situation. In the VA scale of priorities. the bill would place current battlefield casualties above veterans with nonserviceconnected nonemergency conditions. Mr. Speaker. it is highly appropriate that the Veterans Administration hospital system be the main backup to the military. particularly In time of war. The Olin E. Teague Veterans Medical Center at Temple. Tex.. is a perfect eyample of the potential that is available in time of war or conflict. We have a number of buildings at the center that were former wards during th -. days of McCloskey General Hospital. For a minimum amount of funds the interior of these buildings could be refurbished and utilized to house patients. There are 13 buildings iLlat. could be converted to the backup system. making a minimum of 666 beds available which would meet Joint Commission of Hospital Accreditation requirements. If the center were to receive approval for a new domiciliary to accommodate 400 patientmembers and If It were to be located on available vacant VA land. there could be an additional nine buildings available for conversion. capable of expanding to an additional 570 beds meeting Joint commission requirements. At this station alone. Mr. Speaker. there is the potential for a total of 1.236 beds. It could be done without enormous expenditures of funds. I am certain there Is similar potential existing at the two other VA medical centers in my districtthose located at Waco and Marlin. Tex. It concerns me that the Department of Defense Is giving consideration to contractinmg outside of Government In order to have a backup system In case of defense mobilization. I question whether or not this should be done and I think the Secretary should proceed with caution until the provisions of my bill are enacted. which would provide specific authority for the Veterans Administration to work with the Department of Defense In a national emergency. With the concurrence of the chairman of the full committee. my good friend. ""SONNY"" MONTGOMERY. I Will ask the chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction to hold early hearings on this bill so that we might proceed to put in place a proper backup system In case of national mobilization. I am particularly anxious to see that the Medical Center at Temple. as well as those at Marlin and Waco. are not overlooked in the discussions that will take place.e"
970014413,Mr. Speaker. in his budget adjustments submitted to the Congress on March 10. President Reagan has recommended a reduction in the Veterans Administration budget of $747.7 million in budget authority and $830.9 million in outlays to the amounts requested by former President Carter. As a member of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. I recognize the need to bring about some reduction in the Federal budget. However. I would point out that under President Carter the Veterans Administration sustained substantial budget cuts in fiscal years 197981. Congress put back some of the employee cuts but the VA has approximately 2.000 employees and 5.200 operating beds less today than in fiscal year 1979. Although benefits and services for veterans is high on my list of priorities. I will work with the chairman of our committee to bring about some legislative cost savings in order to accomplish a substantial reduction in total Federal spending. Having said this. it should be noted there are some savings being proposed by OMB that would adversely impact on veterans. These I will not accept. First. I am not willing to accept the proposed cuts in the medical program that would total more than $330 million during the next fiscal year. At a time when the Veterans Administration is unable to treat eligible veterans for their disabilities. especially on an outpatient basis. the medical program cannot be cut by $330 million without denying even more veterans the opportunity to receive care and treatment in VA hospitals and outpatient clinics. This is compounded. Mr. Speaker. when 12 million veterans of World War II. whose average age Is 60 years. are beginning to apply for admission to VA facilities for care and treatment. Health problems for these individuals will occur more often and the length of stay in VA hospitals will be longer as they get older. Mr. Speaker. even though the pro. posed medical reductions are a major concern to me. I am even more concerned about Mr. Reagans proposed plan to consolidate the functions of regional offices. Currently. there are 58 VA regional offices located throughout the United States. There is at least one regional office in each State. These regional offices process benefit applications and changes in compensation. pension. burial and housing programs. Mr. Reagans plan would consolidate into one location all the benefit processing activities of these offices. In other words. Mr. Speaker. the adjudication and loan guaranty operation in the current regional offices would all be transferred to one Federal location. It would probably take a building almost as large as the Pentagon to take care of the files and the 12.000 personnel envisioned to operate such a facility. One can imagine the bureaucratic rigor morits that would set in with this kind of operation. Efficlency would go downhill. Files would be in a mess. and many of them lost. Mr Speaker. you would have one of the biggest bureaucratic snafus ever known to man. The administration says this proposed consolidation would require no regional office to be closed. Anyone knows that if the adjudication and loan guaranty processes are moved out of the regional offices. hardly anything would remain. It seems obvious. Mr. Speaker. that regional offices would become nothing more than glorified contact offices. or they would be closed. This we cannot tolerate so today I am introducing legislation that would prohibit the Veterans Administration from exercising any authority to consolidate. eliminate. abolish. or redistribute the functions of any regional office. hospital. outpatient clinic. or any other facility. unless Congress approves such action. My bill is cosponsored by the chairman and ranking minority member of the full committee. Mr. MONTGOMERY and Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. I have asked the chairman to allow the committee to consider this bill early. Mr. Speaker. In my view. it will pass by an overwhelming vote. not only in committee. but in the House Itself. No Member of this body intends that any regional office or VA hospital be closed. Although the administration tells us closings are not in its current plans. if reductions are made in fiscal year 1983. 1984. and 1985 approaching the Proposed reductions for fiscal year 1982. in my view. we will be faced with possible closing of VA facilities in some States. I do not think my colleagues will ever support such action and my bill Is designed to see that such closings do not occur.e
970022337,Mr. Speaker. today I have introduced a bill that. if enacted. will assure our Nations veterans that we Intend to fulfill our commitment to provide quality health care for those who need such care. My bill would authorize the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to establish. operate. and maintain not more than 125.000. and not less than 100.000. hospital and nursing home beds over which the Administrator has direct jurisdiction for the care and treatment of veterans and to maintain a contingency to assist the Department of Defense In time of war or national emergency. The bill would further provide that the President must include In the budget transmitted to the Congres .s for each fiscal year- a level of funding for hospital. medical care. and nursing h~ome care for veterans and construction funding sufficient to enable the Veterans Administration to fully fund. staff. and operate not less than the 82.500 hospital beds and 9.000 nursing home beds. Mr. Speaker. the past 10 years has been a very difficult period for the Department of Medicine and Surgery. Although the Congress has continued to expand eligibility for care and treatment in VA hospitals over this period. constraints placed on VAs healthcare delivery system by the Office of Management and Budget has brought about a rapid reduction of operating beds. OMB has. for example. required that V*A use funds appropriated for personnel to pay ever Increasing utility bills. or to help absorb annual pay icreases. or other such purposes. In addition. even though we have experienced doubledigit Inflation for several years now. OMB has not allowed adequate Increases in VAs medical program to even offset the rate of medical Inflation for several years. Consider. If you will. Mr. Speaker. the following. At the close of fiscal year 1966. the VA operated a total of 116.975 hospital beds. At the close of fiscal year 1982. unless my bill Is enacted. the number of operating hospitalbeds In VA is expected to reach an alltime low of 80.700. This reduction In operating beds has taken place even though since 1971. the demand on VA for hospital care by patients aged 65 or more has increased steadily after having decreased from 1966when medicare beganthrough 1970. At present. the level of use of VA medical facilities has returned to what it was prior to medicare. Another critical factor related to current patient demnand is the rapid advancement in age of the.World War II veteran. The average age of the 12 million veterans of World War -11 is about 62. Whereas there are now only 10 percent age 65 and over in the veteran population. 29 percent of all veterans will be age 65 or over and 13 percent will be 75 or over by the year 2000. Because of the age factor. the number of patientapplicants will obviously increase substantially. Mr. Speaker. even though the VA Is now treating more hospital patients than ever beforemuch to the credit of dedicated healthcare personnel in our VA hospitalsthe bed level has reached the point where veterans are being turned away because of lack of beds and resources. The Increase in the number of hospital patients treated year after year. in fewer beds. has been accomplished largely by reducing the length of time patients spend In the hospital during an episode of care. thus making beds available for more adm issions. There is a point. however. where the system is so strained that this can no longer be accomplished. In my view we are reaching that point. As stated earlier. more and more aged veterans will require treatment. The number of episodes of treatment will continue to increase. and the length of stay for each episode will be longer. Therefore. If we do not begin now to bring the number of hospital beds back up to the level I propose. or even higher. we will be facing a crisis of major proportions within the next 2 to 3 years and VA Is not going to be able to handle the load of patients seeking and needing care. Finally. Mr. Speaker. there Is another very important reason why my bill should be enacted. Currently. the Department of Defense has no principal backup medical contingency In time of war or national emergency. Rather than looking to the VA as a backup system. the Department of Defense Is now looking to the private sector for beds in which to handle casualties during armed conflict. The VAs 172 hospitals. with at least one In every Stateexcept for Alaska and Hawaiishould be the primary backup for the Department. Certain changes In current law are necessary In order to effectively implement such an agreement and our committee Is proceeding to report a measure. which I introduced earlier this year. to the House for early consideration. Mr. Speaker. it makes no sense at all to me for the Department of Defense to be looking to spend millions of dollars for a backup medical care system In case of war or national emergency with existing VA network that we have already in place. At a time when we are terminating Federal programs. cutting some veterans benefits. and trying to balance the budget. it hardly makes sense for the Department of Defense to be looking beyond the Veterans Administration for treating casualties resulting from any conflict. 111560 Co Therefore. Mr. Speaker. In order to establish an agreement between the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense. and in order to assure that the VA has the capabilities to make available the number of beds that must be made available at a moments notice. we must maintain the current level of hospital beds. If 0MB continues to drastically reduce the size of the agencys medical capability. any agreement or arrangement between VA. and DOD would be useless. The valuable resource of VA. hospitals would be of little help to the Department of Defense during a time of conflict If the bed level is reduced to the point where It Is Inadequate to meet the current veterans demand. In summary. Mr. Speaker. my legislative proposal will accomplish two basic important national goals. First. it will make certain that an adequate number of hospital and nursing home beds will be available to treat the rapIdly increasing number of elderly veterans who. during the next 10 to 15 years. will require increased periods of hospitalization. particularly for acute episodes of chronic diseases that occur with frequency in this age patient. Second. It Is extremely Important that we make certain the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense enter into an agreement that would assure we have in place an adequate medical backup system In case of mobilization. I would urge my colleagues to consider this measure and join me in sponsoring this legislation.e

This arbitrary action Is damaging and must be halted. Mr. Chairman. section 602 will not make contracting out more difficult than the executive branch says it is supposed to be anyway. However. it does inject some credibility Into the process by requiring a senior commander at the three- and fourstar level to p.-rsonally certify the appropriateness of the proposal. Mr. Chairman. I certainly realize that this section will not correct all of the abuses we are seeing with contracting out In the DODI do believe It Is a step In the right direction. We can at least give It a chancesee if it will correct the executive branch abusesand If not. we can surely get even more explicit. In the final analysis. Mr. Chairman. what this section does is to merely put emphasis on what Is already a part of the circular. It in no way harms the intent of circular A76quite the contraryit clarifies that Intent.
970162530,"Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation which -will limit the Office of Management and Budgets authority to require the Veterans Administration to convert services performed by Federal employees in VA hospitals to contract. On April 27. 1982. Chairman G. V. (SONNY) MONTGOMERY of the Committee on Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Invest!gations held a hearing concerning an 0MB propo:ed draft revision to their circular A76. ""Policies for Acquiring Commercial or Industrial Products and Services Needed by the Government."" This revision proposes drastic measures to dictate conversion to contract for those services with 25 or less employees without requiring cost comparison studies to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of such conversions. The OMB proposal would also mandate that new requirements be satisfied by contracting out without even considering if it would be less expensive to do the work with inhouse personnel. Chairman MONTGOMERY Invited Mr. Donald E. Sowle. Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of OMB. to our hearing to explain the reasons for the proposed revision. which totally Ignores the cost comparison process in determining which VA activities should be converted to contract. Mr. Sowie declined to appear. and I can readily understand his reluctance to try to explain such capricious and irresponsible recommendations. Other witnesses at the subcommitte hearing were quick to point out that the proposed revision was an unabashed and flagrant abuse of taxpayers moneys. and would probably signal the demise of the Federal work force as we know it today. The president of the National Federation of Government Employees. Mr. James Peirce. told us that his organization considered the proposed revision to the circular so onerous to Federal employees that they had requested that Mr. Sowle resign from OMB. Other committees of the Congress are also concerned with this OMB drive to convert the Federal work force to contract. In my other committee. the Committee on Armed Services. in H.R. 6030. the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1983. we placed a 1year moratorium on the performance of cost studied and new contract conversions under OMB circular A76 during fiscal year 1983. The Armed Services Committee considered that the contracting out program had gotten out of hand when the Department of Defense. acting on the direction of OMB. submitted its fiscal year 1983 budget request with 17.000 civilian spaces subtracted from the civilian personnel ceiling account in anticipation that conversion of specific functions to performance by a private contractor would prove feasible. My fellow members of the Committee on Veterans Affafrs and I consider high quality health care for our veterans to be our No. 1 priority. We see this headlong rush to convert VA hospital services to contract by OMB to be a major threat to the quality of medical treatment now being received by this Nations veterans. This irresponsible action must be stopped. and the bill that I am introducing today will stop it in the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the Veterans Administration. Mr. Speaker. this is not a partisan issue and the bill that I am introduc. ing today is cosponsored by the chairman of the full Committee on Veterans Affairs. the gentleman from Mississippi . the rank ing minority member of the full committee. the gentleman from Arkansas"
970180243,Mr. Speaker. I want to compliment the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. the gentleman from Mississippi. for requesting time so that Members may have the opportunity to pay tribute to our Nations veterans. Next Monday is Memorial Day and our Nation. as it has for the past 104 years. will honor and remember all of those servicemen and women who have lost their lives in service to this Nation. It is right and appropriate that this day be set aside for this purpose. It is right and appropriate that all of us on this day ponder and appreciate the enormity of the sacrifice made on our behalf by the more than 1 million men and women who have been killed in wartime service to our Nation from the Revolution to Vietnam. Theie are among us. however. those citizens who do not wait for Memorial Day to honor and remember the American soldier. More than 78.000 men and women comprise the Veterans Administration Voluntary Service. freely giving 10.3 million hours of their time in volunteer service to hospitalized veterans and their families in 172 VA hospitals. To these remarkable and special people. every day is Memorial Day. Every time these volunteers read to a veteran who is sightless. or write a letter for a veteran who is lonely and Ill. these volunteers daily recreate the greatest memorial of alla loving. caring memorial to the American serviceman. These volunteers daily affirm the honor. dignity. and sacrifice of those who died for this country by caring for and comforting the living veteran and his family. There are three VA medical care installations in my district. I have had the opportunity to visit them all many times. and I have seen how heavily these facilities depend on their volunteers. Just think for a moment what it would cost the taxpayers if all of the volunteers walked out of the hospitals. The services and support they provide actually could not be replaced. Their concern and commitment are pricelessthese feelings of dedication cannot be bought and they are every bit as important to the recovery of the hospitalized veteran and his family as the expert medical care he receives from the VA physicians and nurses. We all know that President Reagan has stressed the concept of voluntarihm. of citizens helping citizens. Those in the VA Voluntary Service are way ahead of the rest of us. There is no other Federal program that operates with the assistance and active cooperation of such a widespread volunteer effort. This Memorial Day let us pay tribute to the thousands and thousands of men and women who have served in our Armed Forces in times of war. Our gratitude to those who have laid down their lives for our country can never be adequately expressed. But let us also pay tribute to those 78.000 volunteers who daily express their gratitude to our Nations war dead by serving and supporting our over 30 million living veterans and their families. To all of you in the VA Voluntary Service. thank you for sharing your time. compassion and love.e
970242690,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 6782. as amended. the Compensation. Education and Employment Amendments of 1982. This bill provides for a welldeserved 7.4percent costofliving increase across the board for serviceconnected disabled veterans and their eligible dependents and survivors. This provision continues our firm commitment to recognize the sacrifices made by our serviceconnected disabled veteransNo portion of this bill concerned by more than amending section 5010 of title 38 relating to the operation of VA .medical facilities. to restrict the VAs abilityunder OMB circular A76 or otherwiseto contract with private entities for the performance of activities in the agencys Department of Medicine and Surgery. While I yield to no Member of Congress in my desire to see the Government save money. I do not believe it should be saved by reducing the quality of medical care for our Nations veterans. And while I did not get everything I wanted in this section of the bill. I am convinced that my concerns have been protected. The botton line is that commercial activities performed at VA hospitals operated by the Government shall be retained inhouse if the Chief Medical Director determines that such performance would be in the best interest of patient care. both direct and indirect. In other words. no purely costsavings initiative will be permitted to interfere with the VAs providing quality health care services to veterans. Among other diverse but important provisions of the bill are proposals that would increase the compensation rate for certain blinded veterans. restored burial benefits for certain indigent veterans. provide for a burial flag for a distinguished nonveteran citizen if the Administrator authorizes his burial in a VA national cemetery. clarify the intent of Congress that burial benefits are payable if a veteran dies while a patient in a Veterans Administration contract nursing home. In conclusion. Mr. Speaker. I commend my great chairman. SONNY MONTGOMERY. for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. I also commend DOUG APPLEGATE and BoB EDGAR for their fine efforts on this legislation. and indeed all members of our committee. both majority and minority. I wholeheartedly recommend this bill to my colleagues and urge its adoption.e

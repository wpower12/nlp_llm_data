970024064,Mr. Chairman. I rise In support of the GrammLatta bipartisan substitute to the House Budget Committees approved budget resolution. The bipartisan substitute has Incorporated various provisions de11 1783 signed to improve our position of military strength while maintaining beniefits for those poor and needy in our country. According to the bipartisan substitute. defense spending wvill be targeted at $162.1 billion for 1981 and ait $188.8 billion for 1982. The proposal will allow for an Increase in spending of nn average of 7 percent per year over the next 5 years. Mr. Chairman. we need to strengthen our military capabilities In order to maintain a balance of power with the Soviet Union. The bipartisan substitute proposal will help us to do this. Increased funding will strengthen our strategic forces. improve Americas military readiness. and accelerate the modernization of U.S. combat forces. Our ability to deploy forces in remote areas. such as thle Indian Ocean and the strategic Persian Gulf. will be Improved by increase3 in naval surface forces. Special equipment will be acquired to enable combat forces to operate in hostile environments. such as desert wvarfare. The modern .atfin of our conventional forces will be accelerated by a more rapid procurement of new equipment. including tanks. helicopters. naval aircraft and issiles. The combat readiness of U.S. Forces will be improved by providing funds for additional spare parts needed to sustain higher operating rates and to fill war reserves requirements. Provisions for higher military pay rates will also contribute to readiness by attracting and retaining skilled military manpower. We need these improvements so that our strength and capabilities will not be suspect and so military equilibrium onl a global scale can be maintained. Mr. Speaker. the improvements in our military capabilities and defense forces are not Intended to come at the expense of the poor and helpless in this country. Precautions wvill be taken to Insure that the necessities of life will be provided. The bipartisan proposal has allowed for spending targets of $239.3 billion in 1981 and $263.9 billion In 1982 for social programs. The proposal Is committed to protecting basic retirement. health. and incomne assistance requirements. Social be nefits for the elderly. including social security wvill be preserved in full. In keeping with promises made in thle past. 23 million retired social security recipients will continue to receive benefit increases each year. Federal outlays for thle medicaid program will be limited to $16.3 billion for fiscal year 1981 and will rise only 5 percent in fiscal year 1982. Federal block grants for medicaid expenditures will not prevent those in poverty from receiving medical assistance. but rather. the block grants will result in a significant reduction in Federal administrative overhead. The proposal will not end Income assistance to individuals who must rely on public assistance to meet their basic needs. It is designed to Improve these programs. making them more effective and efficient. Changes in the aid to families with dependent children will save $671 million In 1982. Many social programs will continue to operate as they were designed to do. providing assistance to millions of needy families. The proposals will not be Instituted to hinder the poor. but rather to bring expenditures under control and to allow programs to fulfill their intended purpose. Mr. Speaker. I support the GrammLatta bipartisan substitute propiosal because it provides an opportunity to correct many of the problems which we are now facing in our country. It will allow us to provide for the needs of our people as well for our common defense. Mr. Speaker. in addition to my comments I would like to request unanimous consent that a telegram from the Greater Florence Chamber of Commerce concerning President Reagans economic program be included in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks:
970067431,Mr. Speaker. I rise In support of the National Tourism Policy Act being considered here today. This legislation is essential for the continued strength and vitality of the travel and tourism community. The tourism Industry Is increasingly becoming one of the major Industries of our Nation and deserves our attention and support. The tourism Industry is forecasted to become the worlds largest Industry by the year 2000. Here. in the United States. It generates $33 billion in wages and salaries annually. while employing 4.4 million people. There are nearly 1 million businesses. virtually all of which are small businesses. Involved directly in tourism. Mr. Speaker. we need to focus on an industry of this magnitude in order to utilize It to the fullest extent possible. The National Tourism Policy Act will help us to do this. It will establish a national policy which recognizes the Importance of tourism to the Nations social and economic welfare and will set up the appropriate Instruments for Implementing that policy. The implementation of tourism policy and programs will be facilitated by the establishment of an administration within the Department of Commerce. The administration will have the responsibility of monitoring and directing the growth of the tourism Industry in this country. The proposed legislation will direct the administration to develop a comprehensive tourIsm development plan. to lipe approved by Congress. this plan will become the basis for efforms to promote touism here. and more especially in other countries. This will have a number of positive economic and cultural advantages as more foreigners come to visit our country. Foreign visitation will aid in the continued strengthening of the dollar and will help to offset our serious balance of payments deficit. In addition. mutual understanding will be enhanced by other nationals experiencing our way of life. We need to Insure these benefits by supporting the concerted approach to planning. The National Tourism Policy Act will not require additional funding. The funding levels are Identical to those requested by the administration for tourism. In actuality. the funding requirement Is considerably less than that provided last year. The benefits it will return will outweigh the costs which will be incurred. By placing our emphasis on planning and promotion of a valuable and replenishable resource. we will help secure the employment of millions. strengthen thousands of small lb sinesses across the Nation. reinforce our economy. and promote international good will.*
970067895,Mr. Speaker. on May 19. 1981. I attended a receptindinner at the SheratonWashington Hotel. honoring Senator STROM THURMOND. chair and scholarships In law at the University of South Carolina School of Law. Sponsored by the leadership of the U.S. Senate from both sides of the aisle. it was an evening to remember. Well over 500 friends of Senator THURMOND. contributed more than a quarter of a million dollars to the law school and. together with funds previously raised by friends in South Carolina and elsewhere. the overall goal of a half million was realized and exceeded. Political parties were forgotten. It was a special night when friends from both parties in the Senate paid tribute to their STROM THURMOND. Having known and admired Senator THURMOND. for many years. I have observed his leadership firsthand. An uncommon man of the people who elected him for so many years. he Is a man of principle. a man of honor. and a man of integrity. Several of his friends spoke glowingly of Senator THURMOND. on his night. They spoke of many of his achievements. There are many reasons this man was honored by the leadership of the U.S. Senate. the University of South Carolina. and his friends. Those of us from South Carolina. in sharing him with the Nation. can point with pride to still other honors. not mentioned that evening. he has brought to our State. Senator THURMOND. is only the fourth South Carolinian In the history of our Republic to be elected as President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate. When he was elected earlier this year. it had been over 160 years since the last South Carolinian. John Gaillard. relinquished his duties as President pro tempore In 1818. Senator STROM THURMOND is the third South Carolinian In the history of our Republic to be elected by his colleagues In the Senate as chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. It had been over 120 years since a South Carolinian had chaired this very important committee. when Senator THURMOND became Chairman THURMOND. at the beginning of the 97th Congress. Looking at the distinguished career and service of this humble. yet great man. it is not surprising that Strom Thurmond. has become a legend In his own time. I wish to insert into the RECORD the remarks of Senator HOWARD BAKER. JR.. Senator ROBERT C. BYRD. Senator PAUL LAxALT. Senator ERNEST P. HoLLINGS. President James B. Holderman of the University of South CarolinaMr. Mark Wilhelmi. president. of the Student Bar Association. School of Law. University of South Carolina. and the response of Senator TH1URMOND:
970081637,"Mr. Speaker. when hundreds of people gathered recently to join in the dedication of the G. V. Montgomery National Guard Complex In his hometown of Meridian. Miss.. among them was Vice President GEORGE BUSH who Joked about a massive sign with 5foot letters spelling out the name of the facility. The Vice President. tongue in cheek. said he was critical of the sign. He said It should have been larger. That way. It could be read 140 miles away in Biloxi. It Is fitting that the sign on the G. V. Montgomery National Guard Comnplex is larger than most. because Congressman SONNY MONTc.OMEIys life has been just like thatlarger than most. He has served with (list inction in everything he has ever undertaken. isI. military record reads like a page fromn a Hollywood movie script about largerthanlife heroes. His service was noted with not only the stars of a general officer. but such revered awards as the Legion of Merit. the Bronze Star for Valor. the Meritorious Service Award Commendation Medal. He not only served his Nation In one war. World War II. but returned to answer the call of duty during the Korean conflict. His civic record is jIust as glittering with accomplishments including the Mississippi Magnolia Cross Awvard. the Red Cross Certificate of Merit. the National Guard Associations Distinguished Service Medal. namned ""Mississippian of the Year"" by the Mississippi Broadcasters Association. and countless others too numerous to mention. Since the voters of the Third District of Mississippi sent him here 15 years ago. Congressman SONNY MONTCOMEDY has approached his appointed tasks as an elected official in typical Montgomery fashion. full speed ahead. His record in Congress speaks for itself. It is a starstudded record carved in legislative history by a man whos principles fit the mold of Thomas Jefferson. who said: ""In matters of principle. stand like a rock."" SONNY MONTGOMERY has stood like a rock in Congress. in war. in peace. in his community. in everything he has ever done and said. It Is fitting that a National Guard armory be dedicated in his name. for he has been a guard of our national interests throughout his long and energetic life. I want to take this opportunity to share the news reports of this dedication ceremony with my colleagues: [From the Commercial Dispatch]I"
970085612,Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the gentleman from California and the other members of the subcommittee. along with the distinguished gentleman from California . for the help they have given us In resolving this matter. I would also like to thank my colleague. the gentleman from North Carolina . who has the neighboring district. and say that we have worked together on this. and I appreciate his help and his concern. It Is always good to be able to work together on a matter between North and South Carolina. and I think this particular piece of legislation will be In the best interests of both States. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to wholeheartedly recommend and support H.R. 2896. which gives the consent of Congress to the agreement between North Carolina and South Carolina establishing their lateral seaward boundaries. Until recently. no official seaward boundary -between our two States was considered necessary. However. with the declaration in 1977 of a 200mile U.S. fishing zone. it became apparent that such delimitation would be desirable. both to minimize possible problems regarding coastal fisheries management and Coastal Zone management programs. and to provide for contingencies such as oil leasing rights. It is important to note that the bill will not necessitate additional Government expenditures. or have any inflationary Impact whatsoever. It merely gives congressional approval to a compact already formed between the two States. Perhaps the most outstanding aspect of this legislation. however. is the spirit of cooperation In which It has been reached. Both North Carolina and South Carolina have agreed to and passed In their legislatures measures which are Identical. word for word. In addition. the entire congressional delegations from both States are cosponsors of this bill. Mr. Speaker. by endorsing this measure. I believe that we are carrying on In the best tradition the directions and requests of the legislatures of our two States. Furthermore. through our willingness to work together and to work toward common goals. we are reaffirmIng the commonality of Interest that exists between the people of North and South Carolina.
970092883,Mr. Chairman. I rise In opposition to the resolution and In support of the sale. Congress must now vote on President Reagans plan to sell sophisticated military equipment to improve Saudi Arabias defense capability. This proposal has stimulated intense debate both on Capitol Hill and throughout the Nation. Supporters of the plan argue that this is necessary to counter threats to the Saudis vital resources. particularly from the Soviet Union. Opponents say it will threaten Israels security and cause further problems In the Mideast. I have attended numbers of briefings. study sessions. and conferences concerning the proposal. which focuses mainly on the sale . of the AWACS airplane. and have made a concentrated effort to talk with Sixth District citizens. business. and religious leaders. There are several reasons for my decision to vote for the sale. First. Americas goal of enhancing the security of the Middle Eastern States can be advanced by supporting the Saudi Arabian. efforts to develol. their own strong air defense. Th^.t nation Is very vulnerable now to attack. Saudi Arabias large size. sparse population. and concentration of strategic oil deposits makes defending the country a difficult task. It produces more oil than the United States. yet all of its oil is concentrated In a small area bordering on the Persian Gulf and very vulnerable. The oilflelds are located near Iraq. and are less than 100 miles from the Soviet border. President Sadats assassination. the fall of the Shah of Iran. the IranIraq war. Increasing threats from Libyas Col. Moammar Qaddafi. combined with Soviet efforts in South Yemen. Ethiopia. Afghanistan. and other nearby nations leave no question that Saudi Arabia needs our support. From Moscows perspective. the region Is Russias natural gateway to Africa. the most convenient air and land corridor to the Indian Ocean. and effective access to the relatively unprotected southern flank of NATO. Soviet borders reach within 600 miles of the Persian Gulf. giving the United States a distinct geographic disadvantage In the region. Second. this proposed sale would boost the effectiveness of our owvn military capability If we were required to deploy American forces in the area.
970147933,"Mr. Speaker. I would say to the gentleman from California that we are very appreciative of his making this time available so that we around the country can honor truly outstanding members of American agriculture. Mr. Speaker. I am also quite proud to inform my colleagues in the House that one of my constituents. Mr. Laurie Lawson of Darlington. S.C. has been chosen for membership in the 1982 American Cyanamid Co. 65 Club. The name of this important programwhich is sponsored by one of the largest manufacturers of agricultural chemicalswas derived from the fact that when the club was formed. the average U.S. farmer produced enough food and fiber for .65 persons at home and abroad. Members of the 65 Club. however. now produce much more than this. Mr. Lawson is 1 of 10 farmers in the United States who will be- recognized this year for his record of achievement as an agricultural producer and his successful practice of sound farm management principles. This includes the safe. proper. and judicious use of chemicals and other modern production tools and techniques. Accompanied by his wife. Betty. Mr. Lawson is in Washington this week to participate in official National Agriculture Day ceremonies on March 18. as a member of the 65 Club. Mr. Lawsons 1.717 acre farming operation is impressive. and constitutes an important part of the overall productivity of the American farming community. The allocation of his land includes 1.100 acres of soybeans with an average yield of 30 to 33 bushels per acre. 240 acres of small grain with an average yield of 40 bushels of wheat per acre. 180 acres of cotton with an average yield of 750 to 800 pounds lint per acre. 87 acres of tobacco with an average yield of 2.400 pounds per acre. 50 acres of sweet potatoes with an average yield of 350 to 400 bushels per acre. and 50 acres of pasture. Mr. Lawson is known as a hard working and efficient farmer. He plants soybeans using a minimum till method after harvesting his small grains early in the summer. Planting two cropssoybeans and small graineach year on the same acreage enables him to increase his return per acre. Mr. Lawson was chosen for his membership in thie 65 Club not just because of his productivity. but also because of his leadership. In 1979 he was appointed chairman of the South Carolina Agriculture Commission. He is a trustee of the Trinity United Methodist Church. and is quite active in various church activities and organizations. is vice chairman of the board of trustees of Epworth Childrens Home in Columbia. S.C.. is member and past chairman of the board of directors of the C. & S. National Bank of South Carolina in Darlington. is member and past chairman of the Darlington County . Development Board. director and past president of the Darlington County Associated Club. and member and past president of the Kiwanis Club. Since I have had the job of representing South Carolinas Sixth District. I have witnessed firsthand Laurie Lawsons concern and compassion. He has often been to Washington to argue the needs of American agricultureand he does so most effectively. Mr. Lawsons work and achievement in the community have been duly recognized. In 1962 he was named an Outstanding Young Farmer by the Darlington Junior Chamber of Commerce. in 1976 he received the ""Professional of the Year"" award from the Darlington Chamber of Commerce. Laurie Lawson is an outstanding farmer. an outstanding gentleman. an outstanding family man. and an outstanding leader in South Carolina and the Nation. The name Laurie Lawson is synonymous with what is right with our country. Mr. Speaker. the proven productivity of American agriculture is a vital ingredient in our strength as a nation. both domestically and internationally. I am pleased and honored that one of my constituents has been chosen for membership in the 65 Club. I know that you and all other Members of the House join with the in extending our congratulations to Mr. Lawson for this important achievement."

H.R. 6788 seeks to pro- entitled to reinstatement of their jobs. vide reemployment protection for a This came as a surprise since. relatively small but important group .historically. the Department of Labor of about 6.000 reservists and guards- had taken the position that members of the Reserve and National Guard who were absent from their civilian employment for the purpose of performing active or inactive duty for training were entitled to reinstatement to their jobs under the veterans reemployment rights program. regardless of the length of such training. Two recent decisions handed down by the Fifth Judicial Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. are the basis for the new Labor Department policy on the extent of protection for reservists. as provided in the veterans reemployment rights program. Simply stated. the new policy limits for the first time the protection of reservists of National Guardsmen on active duty for training for 90 calendar days every 3 years. The Department of Defense cannot live with this new policy and supports legislation to correct the problems the new Labor Department policy has created. Upon learning of this change in policy. I introduced H.R. 5209. a bill similar to H.R. 6788. Hearings were held by the Subcommittee on Education. Training and Employment on H.R. 5209 at which the administration and public witnesses testified. This new interpretation of the v.w and its effects on the members of the Reserve and National Guard who attend training for longer than 90 days is of great concern to the committee and the Department of Defense cannot live with it. The Labor Department has misread the ruling of the courts involving two cases pertaining to employment rights for active duty for training purposes and thus we find ourselves having to legislate to provide job security for a few critical members of our total force. As reported. a member of the R*serve or National Guard who is absent from civilian employment to perform active duty for training for more than 90 days will have reemployment protection for up to 12 months within 3 calendar years. I want to express my appreciation for the cooperation and assistance of JOHN PAUL HAMMERSCHMIDT. ranking minority member of the committee. In addition. I commend Boa EDGAR. chairman of the Subcommittee on Education. Training and Employment. for his leadership in developing and advancing this legislation. and the cooperation and assistance of MARGARET HECKLER. the ranking minority member of the subcommittee as well as all of the members of the subcommittee. Mr. Speaker. I urge the adopLion of the bill as reported by the committee. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.

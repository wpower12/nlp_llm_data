970006010,Mr. Speaker. I am today reintroducing legislation I. sponsored last year to prohibit the use of master meters for. gas and electricity supplied to new buildings. which have more than one unit. Passage of this bill would cut back on the considerable amount of energy currently wasted in apartments and commercial buildings with master metering. As we all realize. the need for our Nation to save energy is absolutely essential. Our reliance on imported oil makes us politically and militarily vulnerable and causes severe economic problems that contribute to unemployment. inflation. the deflated value of the dollar. and our balanceofpayknents deficit. In our efforts to cut back on our use of imported oil. we have greatly neglected one abundant source of energyconservation. Conservation Is our cheapest. cleanest. and most readily available energy alternative. And. conservation. -does not have to mean undue sacrificerecent studies show that the United States can use 3040 percent less energy than it now does with no reduction in our standard of living. Conservation Is thus the equivalent of an alternative energy source: It is far cheaper and -easier to save a barrel of oil than to produce or Import one. At the present time~the gas and electricity usage of the majority of tenants in the United States Is metered at a single point for an entire building. When such master metering--rather than Individual meteringis used. tenants utility expenses are Included in their total rent charges. as a result. individual tenants are not directly aware of the amount of their gas and electricity consumption and thus have no economic incentive to cut back on usage. Not surprisingly. a tenant has a tendency to use less energy when hie has to pay directly for itas Is the case when he receives a monthly utility bill that reflects his own individual consumption of energy. The wasteful habits of tenants who receive their utility service by means of master metering liave long been recognized by both utility company personnel and apartment owners and managers. This considerable and unnlecessary waste of energy was confirmed in a 1975 report prepared for the former Federal Energy Administration. After an extensive study of master metering of electrical service in apartment houses in 10 major cities. the conclusion was reached that residential customers whose electrical service was provided through master meters consumed about 35 percent more electricity than those In similar apartments who received service through Individual meters and who thus paid directly for the energy used. Had the customers with master meters used the same reducedi amount of energy as the individually metered customers. they would have saved 7 billion k W hours In a yearthe equivalent L: 13 million barrels of oil. This bill calls forilndividual metering of gas. as well as electricity. so the savings would be even greater. The evidence provided in the PFEA study is supported by officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. who state that a 35percent reduction in electricity use occurred in public housing projects when the projects were converted from master metering to Individual metering. In 1976. HUD Issued regulations which required the conversion of all public housing projects to Individual metering. where the conversion would be cost effective. by November 1978. Laws which restrict the use of master meters In multifamily dwellings haver been enacted in seven States: California. Florida. Maryland. Minnesota. North Carolina. Oregon. and Texas. None of the utility commisE 400 sions in those seven States report any major problems with the implementation of such laws. The feasibility of totally eliminating master metering from residential servIce has also been proven in Chicago. Ill.. where a Commonwealth Edison Co.. policy of refusing to serve new residential customers through master meters has been In effect for 25 years. That policy has been successfully defended In the Illinois courts. and the company has established workable practices for the maintenance and servicing of their distribution systems in large buildings. In most casea conserving energy *by installing imdi .al metering would not cause undue sacrifice for tenants or cramp their lifestyles: A large proportion of the excess energy used In buildings with master metering occurs when airconditioning and heating units are left to operate at high levels while tenants are away from their apartments during the day or on vacations. Since 40 percent of the total housing. stock that will be available in the United States by the year 2000 will be built In the next 20 years. truly significant energy savings could be made through more energyefficient building design requirements. including Individual utility metering. We must use every reasonable means possible to reduce energy use starting Immediately. and I believe that this legislation will contribute significantly to an effective energy conservation effort.*
970046385,Mr. Speaker. I yield the usual 30 minutes for purposes of debate only to the gentleman from Missouri . pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 163 is the rule providing for consideration of H.R. 3519. the Department of Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1982. It is an open rule providing for 7 hours of general debate. Four of these hours are to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services. 1 hour is to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary: and 2 hours are to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Government Operations. Under the rule. the bill is to be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. The rule also provides for one motion to recommit. After passage of H.R. 3519. the rule makes it in order to take S. 815 from the Speakers table. strike out all after its enacting clause. and insert in lieu thereof the text of H.R. 3519 as passed by the House. S. 815 is the companion bill passed by the other body on May 14. Mr. Speaker. the 7 hours of general debate recommended by the Committee on Rules accommodates the requests of the three committees which have reported on the bill. The Committee on Armed Services requested 3 hours to discuss the bill generally and. roughly. 1 hour to discuss a section of the bill pertaining to military cooperation with civilian law enforcement officials. The Committee on the Judiciary. which received a sequential referral of the bill. requested 1 hour to discuss its proposed amendment to that section of H.R. 3519. The Committee on Government Operations. which also received a sequential referral of the bill. requested 2 hours to discuss its proposed amendments to several sections of the bill dealing with procurement policy and procedures. Mr. Speaker. the ample amount of general debate time recommended by the Committee on Rules. to be followed by consideration of the bill under an open rule. will allow full and fair deliberation on H.R. 3519. It is an appropriate rule under which to consider a bill of this magnitude. I am aware of no controversy surrounding the rule. and I yield to the gentleman from Missouri .
970127207,Mr. speaker. for purposes of debate. I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona . pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.. Mr. Speaker. all that House Resolution 290 does Is waive points of order against certain provisions of H.R. 4559. the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1982. The rule does not provide for consideration of this bill since general appropriations measures are already privileged under the rules of the House. and the general debate time on H.R. 4559 will be determined by unanimous consent of Members rather than by means of a provision In this rule. Also. the bill Is open to any germane amendment. House Resolution 290 waives points or order against sections of the bill under clause 2 of rule XXIprohibitIng unauthorized appropriations and legislation in an appropriations billand clause 6. rule =X (21)-prohibiting reappropriation of unexpended sums from earlier fiscal years. The precise sections for which waivers are recommended are fully stated in the rule. The waivers of clause 2 are necessary because authorizing legislation for the programs involved has not yet been enacted into law. However. all of the necessary authorizations are contained in H.R. 3568. the International Security and Development Cooperation Act. passed yesterday by the House. Clause 6 waivers are necessary because the bill allows small amounts appropriated In 1981 for the African De*velopment Foundation and for International narcotics control -to remain available for expenditure during fiscal year 1982. Title I of the measure -.contains almost $1.4 billion for contributions to multilateral assistance organizations. Including $850 million toward the sixth -replenishment of the Interna-. tional Development Association. This contribution honors a commitment made by the United States In 1980 to help IDA contxme its crucial support for the worlds poorest nations. Title II of the bill appropriates $5 billion for direct economic assistance to needy nations: This figure is about 12 percent above the comparable fiscal year 1981 -appropriation. and means that many Important humanitarian programs. such as population assistance . the economic support fund and agricultural .development and nuitrition will receive more adequate fundIng. STitle III appropriates $923 million fo r military assistance. largely for the Implementation of the Camp David ac.cords. and the final title of the bill funds the ExportImport Bank at the program level set forth in. this summers~reconciliation bill. .With all these. provisions in H.R. 4559. -the measure is still more than $180 million below President. Reagans eptember. budget request for foreign assistance.
970129447,Mr. Speaker. for purposes of debate only. I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona . pending. which I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 288 Is an open rule which provides for the consideration of H.R. 4700. the Standby Petroleum Emergency Authority Act of 1981. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The rule further provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Conmmerce now printed In the bill be considered as original text for purpose of amendment and that the amendment shall be read by titles Instead of by sections.. in addition. the rule waives points of order against the bill for failure to comply with the provisions of section 402(a) of the Congressional Budget Act which prohibits the consideration of any bill which authorizes the enactment of new budget authority for a fiscal year unless that bill has been reported on or before May 15 preceding the beginning of such fiscal year. The bill requires a report to be prepared by the President for submission to the Congress on an emergency preparedness plan and the waiver Is necessary to authorize the preparation of the report since this bill was not reported by the Energy Committee until December 3 of this year. The rule also provides that upon conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment. any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted In the Committee of the Whole- to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. A motion to recommit with or without Instructions Is also provided in the rule. Finally. the rule waives points of order against the consideration of S. 1503. the Senate companion measure to H.R. 4700. for failure to comply with the provisions of section 402(a) of the Budget Act and provides that It shall be In order to consider that bill in the House. House Resolution 288 provides that It shall be In order In the House to strike out all after the enacting clause of the Senate bill and to insert in lieu thereof the provisions of H.R. 4700 as passed by the House. Mr. Speaker. the provisions- of this bill replace the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act which was originally passed by the Congress- during the energy crisis of 1973 and which expired on Septmeber 30 of this. year. The Standby Petroleum Emergency Authority Act requires the President to develop a standby oil allocation plan and grants him the discretionL to promulgate mandatory price and allocation regulations any time during the 3year life of the act. Both types of regulations would be subject to congressional review and would be effective only during periods designated by the President at times of severe petroleum supply disruption. Mr. Speaker. I know of no. controversary on the rule and r would urge my colleagues to adopt the rule so that we may proceed to the consideration of H.R. 4700.
970204498,In your listing there on page 10 of your testimony of some of the recommended fiscal year 1983 deletions. you have the authorization for fiscal year 1983 and then future costs. Under future costs for nuclear aircraft carriers you have the figure $30 billion. What are we talking about there. additional aircraft carriers or the additional cost of the two that are being started now? Dr. Walker. in response to this question: The eventual cost of the two. The aircraft carrier is difficult to be exact on. but the carrier itself is in the range of $3 to $4 billion just to purchase the ship. If you talk about a Navy wing of 86 aircraft on board and then you talk about several submarines to surround it. protect it. and you talk about several destroyers and cruisers to protect the aircraft carrier and then you talk about a replenishement group of oilers. aviation fuel and supplies to supply the whole fleet. you are talking about over the long run of something In the neighborhood of $10 to $20 billion at a minimum for each aircraft carrier you purchase-$10 to $20 billion for each aircraft carrier you purchase. In this bill we are talking about purchasing two at a cost of $6.87 billion. What I am saying is really the aircraft carrier is your first buy into a long run of further purchases that you have to purchase once you buy the aircraft carrier. because it cannot protect Itself without the fleet. Mr. Chairman. I would now like to make the following arguments against the backdrop of those statements and I would in so doing try to address two groups of my colleagues In this body. those who oppose a Navy configuration based on large carriers and carrier task forces. and second. those who recognize we can forgo this $6.87 billion expenditure at least this year. because it seems to me that those two coalitions of Members in this body on this floor can come together to challenge these two systems. The points I wish to make are the following: This is the largest single item in the military budget. the largest single item. Its projected expansion to 15 carrier groups has no military justification. Mr. Chairman. Its only use is a confrontational posture. There really are only two functions for large nuclear aircraft carriers. political show of force on the high seas and . fighting against lightly armed Third World countries. Mr. Chairman. large carriers are vulnerable. They are sitting ducks in a nuclear war. In a nuclear war. they will draw early and heavy nuclear fire. They have no utility in such an environment. While the procurement price is $3 to $4 billion each. let us go over this. Carriers require a large armada of ships to protect them. That costs money. They require replenishment ships for supplies. That costs money. They require funding for aircraft to carry out missions. That costs additional money. They require aircraft to protect the rest of the fleet as well as the carrier itself. That costs additional funds. The real price is billions and billions of dollars per carrier task force. You start with the $3 or $4 billion purchase and suddenly you are into billions and billins of additonal dollars because an aircraft carrier cannot float by itself. It cannot function by itself and if you make the carrier the basis of your fleet. you have to build billions and billions of dollars above the ships and planes in order to protect it. Mr. Chairman. we have always been a sea power as a result of our geography. but there is no way for surface ships to protect the sea lanes in a nuclear war. The large ship on the high seas in a nuclear war. as I said. is a very large sitting duck. It has no use against the Soviet Union in a nuclear confrontation.
970209541,Mr. Speaker. the reconciliation savings recommendations of the committee on Post Office and Civil Service were contained in H.R. 6785 which was reported from the committee on July 23. 1982. Section 3 of that bill established a new entitlement of a 4percent minimum pay increase for Federal employees effective for fiscal year 1983. Under House procedures this new entitlement would require referral to the Committee on Appropriations. However. it was not the Intention of the Post Office Committee to provide a new entitlement. Therefore. section 3 has been redrafted in a manner to eliminate the entitlement authority and the new language together with the other provisions of H.R. 6785 have been incorporated in the bill. H.R. 6862. which Is made in order by this rule. The new language in H.R. 6862 provides that the October 1982 pay - increase for Federal employees shall be 4 percentthe amount assumed in the first budget resolutionif the President submits an alternative plan for less than 4 percent and either House of Corigress disapproves that plan. Mr. Speaker. in accordance with the request of the chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. House Resolution 536 is a modified closed rule providing for the consideration of H.R. 6862. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Posb Office and Civil Service. In order to expedite consideration of the bill. the rule provides that H.R. 6862 shall be considered as read for amendment. The Post Office Committee rejected the 4percent cap on costofliving adjustments for retirees. and as recently as May 27. 1982. the House voted 327 to 94 on the Downey amendment to House Concurrent Resolution 345 to reject the cap on COLAs. However. the Committee on Rules granted Chairman FORDs request to allow an amendment which would impose a 4percent cap on costofliving adjustments for civil service. Foreign ServIce. and military retirees. This amendment would not be subject to amendment and no other amendments to the bill would be in order. This rule adequately protects the rights of the minority while protecting the prerogatives of the Post Office Committee in reporting reconciliation savings within its jurisdiction as directed by the first budget resolution. Mr. Speaker. it should be noted that the amendment is open to debate for 1 hour to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent of the amendment tnd a Member opposed to the amendnent. Further. the rule waives points of order against the amendment for failure to comply with the provisions of clause 7. rule XVIwhich prohibits nongermane amendments. This waiver is necessary because the bill contains no provision relating to costofliving adjustments and therefore a COLA amendment would otherwise not be germane. House Resolution 536 also provides one motion to recommit. H.R. 6862 proposed reductions in outlays for fiscal year 1982 of $32 million and $113 million over the 3year period of fiscal year 1983 through fiscal year 1985. These savings are accomplished by a provision which requires that civil service annuity benefits be rounded to the next lowest dollar and by providing for later annuity commencing dates for employees and Members who retire voluntarily. These proposals were recommended by the Office of Personnel Management and will reduce outlays by $32 million. $37 million. and $44 million in fiscal years 1983. 1984. and 1985 respectively. Mr. Speaker. undoubtedly there will be considerable debate and controversy when this bill is considered. House Resolution 536 will provide the House with an opportunity to work its will on the cuts proposed by the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. I urge.adoption of the resolution.
970217231,"Mr. Speaker. I yield the customary 30 minutes for purposes of debate only to the gentleman from Ohio . pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 547 provides for the consideration of the Banking Committees reconciliation proposal. H.R. 6812. the Salaries and Expenses Limitation Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of gen. eral debate to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Banking. Housing and Urban Affairs. In order to expedite consideration the bill shall be considered as read for amendment. Mr. Speaker. this is a modified closed rule which limits the amendment process to the two major propos. als which were considered by the Danking Committee. During markup Representative STANTON offered a substitute for the committees proposal which would permit the Department of Housing and Urban Development to add an up front lump sum payment of FHA insurance premiums to mortgages at the time of settlement. The Stanton substitute was rejected in committee by a vote of 19 yeas to 24 nays. However. in order to preserve the rights of the minority to offer an alternative proposal. the Committee on Rules granted Mr. ST GERMAINS request to make the Stanton amendment in order. Therefore. the rule provides that no amendment to the bill shall be in order except the Banking Committee substitute and no amendment to the Banking Committee sub. stitute shall be in order except an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of August 3. by Representative STANTON. The Stanton substitute shall not be subject to amendment. Mr. Speaker. to give the House an ample opportunity to discuss the issue of changing the FHA premium collection procedures. House Resolution 547 provides 1 hour of debate on the Stanton substitute to be equally divided between Mr. STANTON and a Member op. posed to the amendment. There are two waivers of points of order to permit consideration of the Stanton substitute. First. the rule waives points of order against the substitute for failure to comply with clause 7 of rule XVI which prohibits nongermane amendments. This waiver is necessary because H.R. 6812 authorizes appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Department of the Treasury and HUD and the amendment which proposes changes in PHA insurance premium collection procedures would not otherwise be germane to the bill. * Second. the rule waives clause 5 of rule XXI against the Stanton substitute.* Clause 5 of rule XXI prohibits appropriations in a legislative bill and this waiver is necessary because section one of the substitute would permit the Secretary to pay refunds of portions of the FHA mortgages insurance premiums. This provision would permit direct payments without action by the Appropriations Committee and thus. could be construed as an appropriation. Upon conclusion of consideration of the bill. one motion to recommit with or without instructions would be in order. however. the instructions on a motion to recommit must be germane to the bill. Mr. Speaker. H.R.. 6812 limits the fiscal year 1983 authorization for salaries and expenses of the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury to $51.632.000 and limits the authorization for HUD salaries and expenses to $593.852.000. The bill imposes a cap on the administrative expenses of the New York City loan guarantee prograin at $775.000 and the Chrysler loan guarantee program at $1.3 billion. Additionally. the bill contains provisions designed to minimize the number of furloughs and reductionsinforce that might result from the limitation on the administative expenses by requiring that reductions be achieved whenever possible through certain personnel practices including limiting hirings and promotions. encouraging voluntary retirement. and restricting ""contracting out."" The overall savings accomplished by this legislation is $5 million. However. the Banking Committee maintains that it has complied with its reconciliation instructions to accomplish a savIngs of $2.1 billion by reporting to the House. H.R. 6267. the Net Worth Guarantee Act and H.R. 4603. the Deposit Insurance Flexibility Act. These bills were passed by the House on May 20. 1982 and October 28. 1981. respectively. and are currently awaiting action by the Senate Banking Committee. It is estimated that the savings which would result from enactment of these two bills together with the savings of H.R. 6812 would surpass the committees reconciliation requirements. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 547 facilitates the orderly consideration of two alternative reconciliation proposals without intervention of extraneous issues which could delay the reconciliation process. I know of no opposition to the rule and I urge its adoption."
970247927,"Mr. Speaker. during the summer.

House Resolution 623 provides for the consideration of H.R. 7357. the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1982. The resolution provides 5 hours of general debate to be allocated as follows: 2 hours to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. 2 hours to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. and 1 hour to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture. To facilitate consideration of this important legislation. the Rules Committee granted a waiver of section 402(a) of the Congressional Budget Act requiring authorizations to be reported by May 15 before the beginning of the fiscal year for which they are effective. Also. the rule provides that the bill will be read by titles. with each title to be considered as read. The resolution makes amendments of December 6 1982. by Chairman PERKINs. corresponding to the amendments recommended by the Education and Labor Committee to H.R. 6514. in order as amendments recommended by the Education and Labor Committee to H.R. 7357. The rule also allows consideration of any germane amendment printed in ber 9. 1982. and pro forma amendments for the purpose of debate. This printing requirement has given Members time to examine the amendments to this complex bill before they are offered on the floor. A motion to recommit is also provided. After passage of H.R. 7357. the resolution waives all rules of the House to permit consideration of S. 2222 and makes in order a motion to strike all after the enacting clause of the Senate bill and to insert the Housepassed text. Finally. the rule provides for a motion to insist on the House amendment and request a conference with the Senate. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 7357 will effect a long overdue reform in the manner in which our Nation regulates legal and nonlegal immigration across our borders. As Member are aware. millions of undocumented aliens reside in the United States and hundreds of thousands more arrive each year. The rapid population growth in neighboring countries to the South and the greater economic opportunities available in the United States guarantee that ever larger numbers will attempt to enter this country in the foreseeable future. H.R. 7357 will take the important steps of encouraging stronger border control and penalizing employers who induce illegal immigration by making jobs available to the undocumented. The bill also grants the opportunity for citizenship to undocumented aliens who have been living and working in this country for several years. The bill restructures many aspects of legal immigration to the United States. expanding opportunities for foreign workers and students to take employment in this country. waiving visas in cases where there is little risk that foreign nationals will attempt to stay here. Finally. the bill provides for unlimited immigration by Amerasian children within the next 3 years. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 7357 is not a perfect bill. but it is. in this Members opinion. a very good one. We do not know of any better one hanging around here in the Capitol waiting to be voted on. It is the result of an enormous amount of hard work by some dedicated colleagues of ours here in the House. and it deserves to be heard by the Members. In the opinion. again. of this particular Member. it is a necessary and a humane bill. and it is very much in our national interests to enact this legislation as quickly as possible.

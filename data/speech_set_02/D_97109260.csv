970038488,"Mr. Speaker. on June 1. my State lost a great Georgian and our country lost a great American. Carl Vinson lived to be 97 years old. he served in the U.S. House of Representatives longer than any other Member. His remarkable career. which encompassed the administrations of eight Presidents. spanned a period of unparalleled change and advancement in the area of defense weapons alone. from the crude and almost primitive to the most sophisticated. Before retiring at the age of 81 years. Mr. Vinson chaired the powerful House Armed Services Committee for 14 years. The defense of our country was a first priority with him. His dedication to this principle earned him the name of ""Mr. Defense."" He acquired the name of ""Swamp Fox"" as a tribute to his canny flair for House strategy. It was this understanding of the Congress and mastery of its workings. combined with his determination to make the United States a military power second to none. that led Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz to say: I do not know where this country would have been after December 7. 1941. if it had not had the ships and the knowhow to build more ships fast. for which one Vinson bill after another was responsible. For his unequalled contributions to defense. Mr. Vinson during his lifetime received every tribute. The House Armed Servicr ""ommittee Room bears his name. He received the Medal of Freedom. the highest civilian award in our Nation. When the U.S.S. Carl Vinson was launched last year. it marked the first time in our history that a Navy ship was named for a living American. For all his power. accomplishment. and honor. Carl Vinson remained a man of simple tastes and basic beliefs. For all the widely reported colorful eccentricities of his personality. Carl Vinson remained a man of feeling and character. He was a gentleman in the best sense of the word. He lived and conducted his work with honesty and great dignity. Herein lies the true secret of his greatness. Carl Vinson was an unpretentious model of personal integrity and energetic commitment to the national interest always. The life of Carl Vinson was long. it was good. and it was productive. The life of Carl Vinson should be studied. lauded. and emulated. I did not have the privilege of knowing Carl Vinson very well personally. but I take pride in the fact that I share with him the common heritage of State and Nation.e"
970069706,Mr. Chairman. we are debating a measure which Is. without question. the largest. most important and farreaching revenue measure In American history. We must do so in a careful and unemotional way. Let us disregard the political rhetoric. the uninformed. lockedin positions. the specialinterest demands. the politically expedient decision. and make up our own minds as to what Is in the best Interests of our people and our country. We have before us today a bill which my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee and I have produced after lengthy considerations. It is. in my opinion. balanced and reasoned. It offers incentives for savings and Investment and relief for those low- and moderateincome taxpayers who have been most burdened by Inflation and social security tax Increases.. Also before US IS a substitute. offered by others of our colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee. We have had more time to consider the provisions of this bipartisan substitute than the last one which was offered in this Chamber. I have studied the substitute and will willingly say that there are good provisions in this package. For example. I am a great admirer of the estate and gift tax provisions In the substitute. since they are Identical to those which I sponsored In committee and which are included In the Ways and Means Committee bill. Nevertheless. as we reach our conclusions on this matter. we must examine the measures in their entirety. rather than isolating a single provi-. sion. to determine if they are fair and well balanced and if they treat our people fairly. Let me point out that. In my congressional district. the median family income Is less than $16.000 per year. Of tax returns filed in the ninth district of Georgia last year. only 3.372 were In the $50.000 a year or above category. The vast majority of my people make under $20.000 a year. over 168.000 families out of a total of 230.000 Income tax return filed. The President has indicated that he wants an acrosstheboard Individual tax cut. that in effect will provide rather generous tax reductions to the higher Income taxpayers and a smaller tax cut to the middle- and lowincome people. He justifies this on the grounds that it Is his desire to encourage more savings and investment which must come from the higher income people and that the overall benefits will ultimately trickle down to the lower income people. Under his proposal. a taxpayer earning $200.000 would receive a tax reduction of $22.000 in 1982. while a taxpayer earning $15.000 would receive a reduction of $350. If this were the only provision In the tax bill. there would be Justification for such an acrosstheboard approach. But there are many other provisions that we must examine before we make the determination as to whether this provision is fair. For example. we have a provision that reduced the tax rate on unearned Incomesuch as Interest and dividendsfrom a maximum rate of 70 percent down to 50 percent. This Is a good provision. but we must be honest with ourselves In recognizing that this is helpful only to the highincome people. It Is not directly beneficial to the middleincome and lowerincome people. simply because they are not In the 70percent tax bracket. Another provision of the bill permits taxpayers to set aside up to $15.000 per year. If they are selfemployed. without paying any taxes on that Income until after they have reached retirement age. This is an expansion of the Keogh plan. Once again. this Is an excellent Improvement In our tax laws. but the higher benefits obviously accrue to the higherincome people. since no middleincome taxpayer can possibly afford to set aside such a large portion of his income. In a similar fashion. we have increased the amounts that employees can set aside from taxation under the IRA provisions of our Tax Code. which also benefit the high middleincome people. Then. there are the estate tax provisions of the bill. which I sponsored. that have the effect of eliminating all estate or inheritance taxes for people who have estates of less than $600.000. Once again. I must say to you that the primary beneficiaries of this section are necessarily those people who have been able to accumulate land or other assets during their working lives. Likewise. the corporate rate reductions and other business provisions of this bill will probably have a greater direct Impact on higher Income people than on lower. and middleincome people. I support these reductions. because I believe they are in the longterm interest of all of our people. Nevertheless. if we are to consider the overall balance of a tax bill. and I believe we must. we need to consider who is receiving the most benefit from what we enact. Oddly enough. we on the committee find ourselves in the position of having to defend our support of targeted individual tax relief. when. In fact. our entire tax system Is based upon a graduated method and upon the theory that a person should be taxed based upon his ability to pay. To target our individual tax cut is simply to provide equitable treatment to those taxpayers who will not be able to benefit from other aspects of the tax bill. In addition. the Ways and Means Committee has done a great deal more for the young family in which both the husband and wife must work to make ends meet. In the area of the marriage penalty. which. In a recent poll. large numbers of my constituents considered a primary problem in the tax area. the committee has provided a 10percent deduction for twoearner couples. effective in 1982. This goes beyond the relief provided for In the administrations substitute. The committee bill also Increases the child care credit for these same young couples tind for the single parent. Of course. my colleagues know that a primary concern of mine since I first came to the Congress has been the Federal deficit. I have not wavered In this concern. Even.-under the best of economic circumstances. it is my fear that we face the threat of an increased deficit. under either of the proposals which we are considering. Nevertheless. the Ways and Means Committee approach Is the most cautious and. If you will excuse the expression. conservative. I endorse this caution and would encourage my colleagues to proceed as cautiously. I do not believe that I will change any votes by my remarks here today. Nevertheless. I counsel caution and great care in consideration of this proposal. The decisions we make today will be examined in great detail. not only by economists and historians but also by our people in the months and years to come. How you vote in respect to fairness and equity to all classes of society will be a decision which will be long rememibered. Let us do what we think is rightfirst and foremost. We were elected to serve. Let ds serve the best interests of our people. Mr. Chairman. I do not think a great deal of oratory or rhetoric is going to change many peoples minds on this particular vote. because I suspect that most people have their minds made up. I fully appreciate the good parts of both tax bills. As several of my colleagues from the Republican side have Indicated. we do have two tax bills that have many good provisions. It is simply a dispute as to which of the two bills will truly do more for this Nation. I want to spend my time very briefly this morning giving my reasons for believing that the prudent course. the more cautious course. the more conservative approach is to go with the committee bill. I recognize the sincere differences that we have as to which Is truly best. but I think that we ought to take just a moment or two and look at really what we are voting on today. First of all. if we were voting just on an Individual tax cut in Isolation. by itself. nothing else. then I think that there is a great deal of merit in the* Presidents position that we ought to have an acrosstheboard tax cut. because it does give more to the higher income people. and they are the people who will invest. We are looking for greater investment In this country. That makes a great deal of sense to me. but I want to remind. the Members. In all fairness and equity. that Is not what we are considering today. We are considering a tax bill that has. In both packages. a reduction from 70 percent to 50 percent In the tax rates on unearned Income. I support that. I think It Is good. It Is in both packages. but one should not be misled. Only the highincome people will benefit from that. We Increased the Keoghs from $7.500 to $15.000 in both bills. But. do not be misled. No one In the $35.000 to $40.000 bracket is going to have $15.000 to set aside. It goes to the higher Income people. We have the estate tax provisions which I authored on the task force. Good provisions. but do not be misled. Once again. the major beneficiaries will necessarily be our higher income people simply because their estates are larger. The capital gains rate Is reduced from 28 to 20 percent. I support this. It is In both bills. but do not be misled. That is generally going to the higher Income taxpayers. Now. the only section that we have where we can attempt to balance the bill. Just a little for fairness and equity. is on the individual Income tax side. Here. the Ways and Means Committee has attempted to do that. We have attempted to say for this Income bracket. below $50.000. that we recognize that they are hit harder by Inflation. their social security taxes will increase greater. and therefore. we give this Income group a slightly better break than Is included In the administrations bill. This. to me. is fully justified when we examine the total bill. I urge your support of the committee bill.

970183218,"Mr. Speaker. on May 24. I. along with Mr. MARTIN of North Carolina. introduced H.R. 6468. a bill which addresses the issues raised by the ""safe harbor"" leasing provisions of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. H.R. 6468 would reestablish the principle that there must be economic substance to a transaction if that transaction is to qualify as a lease for tax purposes. As my collesgues are aware. the safe harbor leasing provisions of last years tax bill have generated a great deal of controversy. These provisions were developed by the administration as an adjunct to the accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS). The purpose of ACRS was to provide new incentives for job creating investments. It was recognized that many firms would be unable immediately to use the more rapid depreciation deductions and more liberal investment tax credits provided by ACRS. These would include firms with little or no current tax liability. because they are newly established. or have had losses In the past or have been aftected by the recession. The safe harbor leasing provisions were designed to allow a firm that could not immediately use the tax benefits associated with its new investment to sell those benefits to another firm that could use them. thus receiving an immediate increase in cash flow. The additional revenue loss resulting from the leasing provisions. over and above the cost of the ACRS provisions. has been estimated to be approximately $27 billion over the next 5 years. The Committee on Ways and Means did not consider the safe harbor leasing provisions in the course of developing last years tax bill. and the Senate Finance Committee gave them only a cursory examination. Regulations interpreting the safe harbor leasing were not published by the Treasury Department until October 20. 1981. about 2 months after enactment of ERTA. Soon after the regulations were published. a large volume of leasing transactions were completed. As the details of these transactions became public. many Members of Congress began to question the efficiency of the leasing provisions. Some corporations announced that by acting as lessor in a number of transactions they were able to totally eliminate their tax liabilities and even claim refunds of taxes paid in prior years. Some lessees were profitable companies who nonetheless entered into safe harbor leasing transactions in order to more completely utilize other tax preferences of foreign tax credits. As more information has been analyzed. it has become evident that safe harbor leasing transactions are not a fully efficient mechanism for transfering tax benefits. This analysis has also pointed out that some firms. particularly those with such extensive carryover losses that they do not expect to have any tax liabilities during the foreseeable future. benefit more from the safe harbor leasing provisions than taxpaying firms benefit from the basic ACRS provisions. In some cases. safe harbor leasing has become more than a mechanism for financing new investments and more than a technique to equalize tax benefits among firms in different circumstances. Rather It has become an outright subsidy going well beyond mere tax relief. In reaction to information about the actual operation of the safe harbor leasing provisions. several Members of Congress introduced bills to repeal the leasing provisions of the 1981 act. Fifteen such bills have been introduced in the House and most of these have additional cosponsors. Others have suggested that only minor. cosmetic modifications are necessary to eliminate certain abuses. H.R. 6468 takes a more fundamental approach to the problem which the safe harbor leasing provisions sought to address. The approa&h taken by this bill. is to return to principles of leasing that existed prior to passage of the 1981 act. The most fundamental principle is that there must be economic substance to a transaction in order for it to qualify as a lease rather than a sale. The bill thus makes specific reference to Revenue Procedures 7521 and 7948. the guidelines previously established administratively by the Internal Revenue Service. Among the principles established by these guidelines is that (1) the lessor must have an equity investment in the property. (2) the term of the lease must be less than the useful life of the property. (3) the transaction must be profitable to the lessor apart from the tax benefits involved. (4) the lessee must provide none of the financing of the property. and (5) the lessor must hold title to the property. However. H.R. 6468 modifies the IRS guidelines in several important respects. First. the minimum equity investment required by the lessor is reduced from 20 percent of the cost of the property to 10 percent. Second. the lessee would have the right to purchase the property at a fixed price as long as that price is at least 10 percent of the original cost of the property. Under the IRS guidelines. the lessee was required to pay a fair market price for the property if an option to buy was exercised. Third. property of a type not readily usable by a person other than the lessee would be eligible for lease financing. As introduced. H.R. 6468 does not contain a specific effective date. Mr. MARTIN and I believe that the effective date for any chance in the leasing provisions should be established by the full Coimittee on Ways and Means when the bill is considered in a legislative markup session. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 6468 represents a responsible solution to the problems raised by the safe harbor leasing provisions of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. It will prevent the safe harbor leasing provisions from continuing to provide unintended subsidies to firms who happen to be in a po. sition to abuse those provisions."
970203570,"Mr. Chairman. it has been said earlier that the decision that is being made is probably a political decision. Let me say in the very beginning that I recognize that I. as a member of the delegation from the State of Georgia. do have an interest in this issue from an economic standpoint. I recognize that my colleagues from the State of Washington likewise have an interest in the 747 built by Boeing. I rcognize that my good friend from Kansas has a great interest in modifyIng or having the modification work of the 747 in Kansas. Just as my friends from St. Louis. likewise have an economic interest. But if we are talking about a political decision. this decision was made by the Commander in Chief. which is the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense is appointed by the President. They have all said in plain language that we need the additional C5s. I say to the Members that I understand the determination that each of us has for our respective districts. and I must say that as a Member from Georgia I share that interest. But I cannot ignore the fact in this case that every single witness who has come before the committee. that is a part of the Department of Defense. from generals on down. do not support the 747. Let me quote from the testimony of General Kelley on June 16 of this year when he said: I have heard some advocates of a commercial aircraft alternative distort facts dealing with our outsize requirements beyond reasonable recognition. Their favorite ploy is to use a single scenario in one geographic area. and even then the facts are twisted or taken out of context * * * I believe it impossible to find a man in uniform who would suggest that our country has sufficient strategic airlift to provide for the early arrival of combat essential outsize equipment. In one breath we hear the proponents of the 747 say the C5 is not a good aircraft. In the next breath they say. look. we have 77 of them. we can carry all of this outsize equipment. In the next breath they say. let us use them because we have to have them for the outsize equipment. That is totally inconsistent. I received a call earlier today from a pilot in Texas. He said. ""Look. I have no interest in this. I have flown 2.000 hours in a C5. I have flown the 747. I have loaded and unloaded these aircraft and this argument that you people are making in the House is ridiculous. You are attempting. apparently. to buy 747s. That is a good aircraft to haul troops. to haul small cargo. but that is not what the military. the Commander in Chief has said that we need today."" So I say to my friends from both sides of the aisle this should not be a political decision. This is a decision that should be on the merits. I recognize there are some large banks that hold a little paper on the 747s. I understand that Boeing has unfortunately sold to some foreign airlines some 747s that they are holding paper on that they need to sell. and I sympathize with them and I will do what I can to help them. but this is not the place to do it. Mr. Chairman. I am disturbed to. think that this House of Representatives would allow a vital national security issue to descend into a debate over parochial interests. The upper House of this great Congress acted on the airlift program using politics as the measure of merit. Their decision in favor of the 747 instead of the C5 will long be remembered as one of the most masterful political campaigns the Senate haru ever seen. I admire the spirit and legislative skill shown in that effort. but. I believe the time has come to put that all behine * Yes. I am from a.orgia and everyone here knows of my determination to represent my constituents to my fullest capacity. It is the same determination which we all share. But. we are now discussing the national security of the entire United States. We must throw out the parochial interests of the States of Georgia. of Washington. of Missouri. of Kansas. and others. We must disregard the interests of a few airlines who would like to dump their surplus 747s on the Air Force. We must ignore initiatives of some major banks who are holding financial paper on some of these airlines. In short. we have an obligation to the American people. and especially the men and women in our Armed Forces. to set aside all these extraneous influences and select an aircraft solely on the basis of the need. When you take away all of these extraneous issues. there is only one thing left. The President. the Department of Defense. the Air Force. the Army and the Marines all say they need the C5B now. The 747 will not do the job. The people who fly. the loadmasters. and the combat troops depending on helicopters. tanks. and equipment for ground support all want the C5. In other words. the people who really count in this fight want the C5. This has been one of the most bitter struggles between Members of Congress in quite some time. Many Members. who do not serve on the Armed Services Committee. have not had the opportunity to participate in the hearings and debates on this issue and may therefore be confused as to where the military and Department of Defense stands. I can tell you that the record shows unanimous support for the C5 on the part of the Secretary of Defense. Deputy Secretary of Defense. Secretary of the Air Force. Secretary of the Army. Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Chief of Staff of the Army. Commandant and Vice Commandant of the Marine Corps. and many others. Let me quote just a couple of statements to give you some idea of how strongly these defense experts support the C5. In a letter to the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. MELVIN PRICE. dated June 4. 1982. Secretary of Defense. Caspar Weinberger. stated. There is an immediate need for additional outsize airlift capability * *. Fallure to fund the C5B dangerously delays resolution of this critical need. In a June 9. 1982. letter to Congressman PRICE. the Secretary of the Army. John Marsh. Jr.. stated. I am writing to emphasize the Armys strong support for the C5 aircraft. The Army needs the C5 to accommodate our outsized and extremely heavy military cargo and weapons systems. Chief of Staff. General Meyer. has stressed in testimony and in letters to other Members of Congress the need for additional aircraft capable of moving outsized cargo in both intertheater and intratheater operations. The C5 was specifically designed for this purpose and is the only aircraft in being that can give us this capability. In closing. Mr. Chairman. it is clear that when you eliminate the parochial selfserving interests involved and examine the pure military considerations. the C5 is th 3 only choice. This is a major defense issue and one that cannot be taken lightly. The debate has been spirited. but we cannot allow that to cloud the issue. The C5 is the right choice and now is the right time to get on with it."
970240918,"President. American Bankers Association. Washington. D.C. DEAR PRESIDENT JENKINS: This letter concerns 8. 2879. the Depository Institutions Amendments of 1982 (8. Rept. 97536). and objections and suggested modifications. raised by the American Bankers Association regarding the legislation. During the past year and a half. the Committee has held hearings and considered legislative proposals dealing with the changing conditions within the financial system. In this process. we appreciated the ABAs willingness to provide the views of its members. especially the detailed analyses and views that it presented during Committee hearIngs and subsequent discussions between Committee members and the ALBA regarding S. 1720. While we recognize that 8. 2879. the legislation that was reported by the Committee on September 3. does not contain all of the provisions from S. 1720 which the ABA recommended be included. we emphasize that the Committee does not intend that S. 2879 mark the end of Committee consideration of structural changes within the financial system. In fact. during the markup session on S. 2879. we stated our intention to proceed with consideration of the GlassSteagall Act at the beginning of the next Congress. In addition to enhancing the ability of financial regulators to deal with troubled depository institutions. which was the principal impetus for financial institutions legislation last year. S. 2879 enhances the competitiveness and the stability of depository institutions by broadening and revising their lending and investment powers and by providing 111 depository institutions with a new. competitive deposit instrument. During the past two years. it has become increasingly evident that depository institutions must be provided with greater flexibility in order to compete against nondeposttory financial intermediaries. Although Congress mandated the phaseout of Regulation Q deposit interest rate controls just over two years ago. the need for further Congressional action to provide a new. marketsensitive deposit instrument has beeneamply shown by the fluctuating interest rates and the growth of investments in money market mutual fund shares. In an effort to provide for more consistent deregulation of the assets and liabilities of depository institutions. S. 2879 and the report accompanying it direct that a new deposit instrument fully competitive with the money market funds be adopted by the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee and made effective within 60 days of enactnent of the bill. In the report. the Committee stated that ""an initial minimum of no more than $10.000. or perhaps $5.000. would produce an account which would begin to permit institutions to compete effectively"" with money market funds. The Committee also noted that it ""is very concerned that imposing an interest rate ceiling on the new deposit instrument could interfere with the competitiveness of the instrument."" While we endeavored to develop legislation in the Committee which would achieve the goal of a competitive and stable financial system. we want to ensure that It does so. Therefore. in light of the recommendations of the ABA. we as Senate floor managers of the bill will include the following in a Committee amendment to be presented when the full Senate considers S. 2879: TITLE Iu Repeal Title I of Public Law 94200 which mandates interest rate differentials on certain accounts: Remove any iterest rate differential that DIDC maintains on any existing account no later than 1/1/84. Upon the removal of any differential. if a ceiling is maintained. the Interest rate which banks are permitted to pay shall be raised to equal the rate permitted to thrifts. Direct DIDC to adhere to. or accelerate. any current differential phaseout schedules to remove any differential before 1/1/84: Prohibit DIDC from imposing any new Interest rate ceiling or differential on the new competitive instrument. Direct DIDC to create a new deposit account that is ""directly equivalent to and compet.tive with"" investment accounts offered by money market mutual funds. We intend the minimum balance for such account shall not be more than $5.000: Limit thrifts commercial checking authority to those persons having a business. corporate. commercial or agricultural loan relationship or to business entities for the sole purpose of effectuating payments by nonbusiness customers: and"
970248447,"Mr. Chairman. as one of the original sponsors of this resolution. I want to speak for just a few moments as to why I believe this amendment is necessary. First of all. the simple fact is that despite continual efforts to limit spending. the Federal budget is simply out of control. The tremendous increases in Federals sending have outstripped the growth of both inflation and real output by a wide margin. The simple facts are that this Nation cannot long survive in absence of either this action or something very similar. If this spending spree was a temporary aberration it might be concluded that the passage of time could cure the problem. But. unfortunately. a quick look at the situation tells us that a more reliable control mechanism is needed if we are truly to survive. I know that there are people who are well intended. very sincere people. who oppose it and who do not want to touch the Constitution. and they say that the prohibition amendment is a good example of what we do wrong. Well. that analogy seems to me to say that we are drunk on Federal spending. and there is nothing we can do about it. so the best thing to do is to continue the drunk spending from now on. I do not believe that the Nation wants that to happen. We talk about the Constitution and what other people have said or done about it. Thomas Jefferson first stated. ""The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by a Republican government."" Alexander Hamilton felt the same way. Harry Truman made similar statements. This is not a partisan issue. This was introduced long before this President became President. It is a bipartisan debt that has been created through the years. There are conservatives who are prodefenseminded in this House who will never vote against any defense expenditure. regardless of the amount. They are partially responsible for the tremendous deficits. One the other side. there are people who will never vote against any increase in social spending. They too are responsible. It is bipartisan. Now is the time to act if we are going to. and I urge the Members to vote for the joint resolution. Mr. Speaker. the concept of a balanced budget is as old as our Republic. Throughout our history. the goal of balancing the Federal budget under normal economic conditions has been part of our ""unwritten constitution."" For example. Thomas Jefferson stated: The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by a republican government. Alexander Hamilton. who shaped early American economic policy more than any other individual. noted: As the vicissitudes of nations begat a perpetual tendency to the accumulation of debt. there ought to be a perpetual. anxious. and unceasing effort to reduce that which at any time exists. as fast we shall be practicable. consistent with integrity and good faith. In his inaugural address. Presid.wnt John Adams state: The consequences arising from the coritin. ual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish us to be careful to prevent their growth in our own. President James Madison asserted that one of the primary goals of his administration would be ""to liberate the public resources by an honorable discharge of public debts."" President James Monroe held a similar position. saying that: After the elimination of the public debt. the Government would be left at liberty ... to apply such portions of the revenue as may not be necessary for current expenses to such other objects as may be most conductive to the public security and welfare. In the 20th century. President Wilson argued on behalf of balanced peacetime budgets. declaring thatMoney being spent without new taxation and appropriation without accompanying taxation is as bad as taxation without representation. In his 1948 budget message. President Truman observed: As long as business. employment. and national income continue. high. we should maintain tax revenues at levels that will not only meet current expenditures but also leave a surplus for retirement of the public debt. President Eisenhower went even further in his 1957 budget message. declaring: We strengthen our financial position by a balanced budget. We must make sure that we do not undermine our financial strength by laying the groundwork for future budget deficits. However. in the past two decades. the Federal Government has run deficits in all but a single year. The deficits have occured in good times and bad. They have come from Presidents who pledged balanced budgets and those who did not. They have come from Presidents of both parties. For the first 143 years of Federal budgetary historyfrom 1789 to 1932balanced budgets or surplus budgets were the nrm. During the second period. from 1932 to 1960. the rule of balanced budgets gave way to a policy in which balanced budgets remained an objective but in which deficit spending was viewed as a useful tool to achieve certain economic results. In the most recent period. from 1960 to the present. deficit spending has reigned supreme while balanced budgets have been ignored an almost forgotten. It is time. Mr. Speaker. to reinstall the concept of balanced budgets and limited Federal spending. I do not say this out of any feelings of nostalgia for a dim and nevertoreturn past. but because the period of the last 20 years. when we did not seek to balance the budget and restrain spending. has been one of prolonged and severe economic difficulty for the people and institutions of this great Nation. The simple fact is that despite continual efforts to limit spending. the Federal budget is out of control. The tremendous increases in Federal spending has outstripped the growth of both inflation and real output by a wide margin and the simple facts are that this Nation cannot long survive in the absence of action the kind we are considering today. If this spending spree were a temporary aberration. it might be concluded that the passage of time could cure this problem. But. unfortunately. a look at the situation tells us that a more reliable control mechanism is needed. I believe that the JenkinsConable amendment addresses the problem. Let me conclude by explaining the provisions of this proposal."
970273569,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the rule. I recognize that this is a rather controversial piece of legislation. but I think that the committee has worked very hard in trying to draft a piece of legislation that will take care of the most sensitive industries and at the same time do something for this part of the world that will be .extremely important to this Nation from a national and international standpoint. There will be offered. however. as indicated by the gentleman from Tenessee. an amendment by the gentleman from the Virgin Islands . dealing with the American possessions of the Virgin Islands and dealing directly also with Puerto Rico ana their industry of rum. I want the Members to listen very carefully when we get into the debate of that issue. because these people. Americans in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. in my opinion. their in- * terest is not being. properly looked after unless we adopt the de Lugo amendment. These people in the Virgin Islands. if I might speak to that for a moment. why are they so important td this Nation? First. of all. they are Americans. Second of all. a little issue that we forget about all the time. the largest oil refinery in the world is located in the Virgin Islands. It supplies most of our jet fuel. most of our heating oil. And to say to the Virgin Islands that they are to be ignored in their very sensitive industry would be an injustice. in my opinion. to that area. I hope that you will listen to the amendment very carefully that Mr. DE Luoo will offer. I think it is a good amendment. It is an amendment that embraces the very agreement that the Virgin Islands entered into with Mr. Bill Brock. our trade negotiator. on behalf of the administration. And suddenly. when we get into committee. we choose to ignore that agreement that was entered into and play a little bit rough handed with our people in the Virgin Islands. I do not think that is right. I have no interest in it whatsoever other than from that standpoint. I ask your support of the DE LUGO amendment.
970273627,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this bill. I recognize that the President. in speaking for the Nation. has made a firm .commitment with this proposed legislation. I think that it is imperative that we as a Nation attempt to do more for people in this hemisphere. in this part of the world. because certainly our strength and our future lies with these people. So while there are areas in this bill about which I have qoncerns. I intend to support it on final passage. I intend to do so enthusiastically because I think it is a good bill. We have looked after some of the most sensitive areas of our own domestic industry. As I indicated earlier during the debate on the rule. I intend to support. if it is offered. the amendment made In order by our colleague. the gentleman from the Virgin Islands . I really believe that the committee has made a mistake in not working this matter out for American citizens in the Virgin Islands. because they are American citizens. Let me remind those Members who are about ready to go to lunch that I want them to think about one thing when this amendment comes up. In the last 15 months. Jamaica has brought into this country 2.700.000 proof gallons of rum that are now stored here. and r00.000 gallons liave been withdrawn. leaving over 2.000.000 there. The tariffs have not been paid. I want to tell the Members that this is owned by multinational corporations. I say to my friends that they ought to think about that when we pass this bill. without the de Lugo amendment that gives some protection for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. I would tell thb Members that this could become an embarrassment. and I do not want to see that happen. We can avoid that if we adopt the de Lugo amendment. The de Lugo~amendment is a very liberal amendment. It attempts to say to the rest of the countries. ""You can increase your importation into the United States by 50 percent a year."" It was agreed upon by Mr. BRocK earlier. It ought to be made H 10136 Co a part of this bill so that we can enthusiastically support it. I will be honest and say to the Members that I intend to support the bill regardless. I have no interest in the Virgin Islands. but there is a principle involved. Today. when the gentleman from the Virgin Islands offers that amendment. I ask the Members to take the opportunity to look at it and study it. It deserves their full support. Mr. Chairman. as we try to help the rest of the Caribbean countries. let us not forget Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. They are. after all. American citizens. and we owe them that much."

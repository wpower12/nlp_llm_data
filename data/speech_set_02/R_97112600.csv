970040896,Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. the purpose of the committee print or the purpose of the bill as it is now worded in section 3 was to delineate those organizations which were to receive the funds from the Legal Services Corporation and to in fact assure that all recipient organizations providing legal assistance were controlled by local or State bar associations. It was to eliminate the haphazard approach that has been followed in the past by the Legal Services Corporation whereby virtually any organization could receive funds and whereby in fact most of the funding that was done was done to organizations that were nonprofit in nature and that had governing boards which were determined by the very bureaucrats in the Legal Services Corporation who wanted to direct things for social activist litigation and who have tended in the past to be more interested in the overall politicizing of the Legal Services Corporations than they have in serving the interests of the poor. than they have in going into the courtroom and going into battle on individual problems. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin would totally destroy the concept of giving power to local and State bar associations. The gentleman from Wisconsin. as the gentleman from Illinois pointed out in the questioning. has in fact drafted an amendment that would allow for as little as 30 percent of the governing boards of the nonprofit organizations to be appointed by local and State bar associations instead better than 50 percent. which was the intent of the Judiciary Committee in voting out the language presently in the bill. I cannot condone that. because of the simple reason that we as a Congress must indeed come to grips with the fact that if this Corporation is to survive in any form. it must be responsible and it must be held accountable to the individuals in the areas served. and there is no better group repre. sentative of the localities being served by the Corporation where legal assistance is being provided than local bar associations. The particular language in the bill presently would provide for a majority of the local members of the bar to control the local recipient organizations. to control in essence the local legal services activities. and this representation would provide a buffer from a great deal of the public criticism that has been going on about the Legal Services Corporation and would temper in fact the rampant way in which we have been going out into left field to get into these activist litigation matters which are far beyond the scope of what was ever intended and getting into the field of politics. It is through an effort to get responsibility into the litigation area that the bill was brought to the floor as it is now.
970069902,"Mr. Chairman. the real debate before us today on this issue where I rise to oppose the Udall amendment and in support of the ConableHance amendment. the Presidents supported substitute for this tax plan. Is the quality. the future quality. of American life for at least tile next generation. The questions really are: Are we going to have a free society of individual liberty and opportunity and free enterprise where we taxpayers can earn and spend. the money that we earn the way we want to. with dollars that mean something. with real purchasing power. or are we going to have a society politicians call free but. in fact. It is a society of ""big daddy"" Federal Government where we earn dollars that really are not worth that much and. In fact. they are worth less and less with each passing year and where we pay more and more taxes on those dollars. even if our income appears to go up. Those are the questions of the quality of life for the next generation that we are going to decide in large measure today. The culprits are big Government. and runaway inflationinflation which Is caused primarily by the creation of too many dollars largely by the funding of a runaway public debt and also by the decline of the underlying value of the dollar. which is not gold or silver. but the productivity of the American people which basically forms the quality of our lifethat ingenuity. that creativity. that inventiveness that has been the product of our great heritage since the Founding Fathers broke from King George over the same problem of taxes. The only way we are going to get productivity up is by cutting taxes. Just like the only way we are going to stop the creation of dollars is by cutting spending and balancing the budget. The only way to get money back into the taxpayers pockets is by cutting Income taxes. The only permanent income tax cut for wage earners and small businesses of middleincome America is in the Presidentsupported HanceConable substitute bill. I urge my colleagues to support the ConableHance amendment because it means in real terms the Indexing that we are talking about to get away from Inflation where a family of two people today earning $30.000 a year is earning only the equivalent of $15.000 a year 10 years ago. Yet they are paying. those two individual wage earners combined are paying more in taxes fo r that $30.000 Income today that Is not real. it is Just the same is $15.000 in rea! dollars of 10 years ago. 48 percev t more than they would have paid in taxes or the $15.000 income just 10 *years agv. 0 1430. 1 call on my colleagues to vote for the Presidents tax cut plan and I call on themr to listen to the American public. It Is our revolution that we are participating in. It is a revolution of our age and our generation that demands a return to the people of this country the Government which has so long been reposited not with them but with the people sitting up here instead. I call for the cutting of spending. yes. but I call for It as a responsible cut to balance the budget In that fashion and the cutting of taxes to put the money back in the pockets of. the American people to spend the way they want to. rather than the way the.. ""big daddy"" Federal Government wants them to do. I yield back the balance of my time."
970101169,Mr. Chairman. I rise In opposition to H.R. 4603. 1 do not doubt for a minute that there are problems with the mutual savings banks in the Northeast. and that we need to do something about them. As far as this bill goes In that direction. I support it. The problem is that the bill goes much further than the mutual savings banks in the Northeast. It opens the potential door. however small the crack may be. to interstate commercial banking. It tears down the fabric potentially of the dual banking system of our States and our Federal Government. and It leads to an inevitable concentration of financial powers in the largest financial Institutions %of this country. That is why I oppose this Particular bill. The fact of the matter is that this bill favors the highest bidder in most of the major provisions that are in it. the highest bidder being the biggest banks in this country when the opportunity presents Itself.I The Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has said with respect to the savings and loan provisions in this bill that they are not necessary. he does not need them. but he needs a lot of other things. He already has whatever merger powers are needed in the FDIC and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board area. So the point Is that the legislation with respect to the Federal savings and loan Is not what is necessary in this bill. Furthermore. the bill goes further than simply mutual savings banks. because in section 15 It deals with commercial banks as well. and there Is no testimony that any commercial banks are in imminent danger of being closed. The bill simply has holes in it. It does not need to be written the way It Is. It does not need to be as broad as It Is. and the fact of the matter is that It Is opposed by every major trade association that testified before us. with one exception. The fact Is that the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. the National Governors Association. and the National Conference of State Legislators are opposed to this bill. As has been pointed out earlier. If this bill goes on to the Senate. maybe it will not be Christmastreed. because the chairman indicated he will work very hard not to allow that to happen. But I suggest that whatever happens with respect to that conference. the chances are that this will be the bill coming before this House in this session of Congress to deal with the problems of the savings and loans. We have to deal with them responsibly by sending this bill back to committee to work on the real problems facing the savings and loans and the mutual savings banks. If we do not bring up a bill that deals with those failures and those problems in the right way. this body will not have that opportunity. :
970102172,Mr. Chairman. these amendments are concerning two different matters. One of them is in section 15 of the bill. What it dots Is to restrict the provisions of the closed bank merger section to the mutual savings banks and saving banks and eliminates the current provisions in the bill which would affect the large commercial banks as well. The second amendment concerns section 8 of the bill which deals with those savings and loan mergers that have been discussed so widely here today and yesterday. At the present time the bill reads that the paramount consideration of the FSLIC in a merger situation shall be to minimize the loss of funds to that organization to the insurance fund. There is an order of preference which is given some casual mention in the bill that is to be considered but secondary to the paramount consideration. What this other amendment does. the second amendment to section 8 does. Is to eliminate the paramount consideration provision and. provide that the order of preference that is In section 8 for the types of Institutions to be considered. the order in which they are to be considered by the mergIng organization. will be given equal consideration with. the need to minimize the loss of funds to the Insuring agency. and further. it provides that In situations where there are offers which are acceptable from an institution falling into a higher category of preference which offers have contained in them sufficient funds. sufficient body and substance to return at least the estimated cost to the corporation of liquidating. that this partlenihar offer has to be accepted over and above an offer from an Institution falling Into a lower sequence In the order of preference. For example. if we go to the first particular order of preference. It says between institutions of the same type within the same State. If we have an offer made for a merger and acquisition dealing with an S. & L. with an intrastate situation where we are talking about the same type institution within the same State and within that offer there were sufficient funds Involved that the insurance funds of the FSLIC are protected by their cost estimate. they are going to recover 100 percent of their coststhey are not going to have a loss to the corporation because of cost involved for the FSLIC In the merger process. In that circumstance the Corporation would not be allowed to drop down to the second preference. such as B. C. or D. It would have to go with that offer or the best offer within that category or that particular preferencein this example. the first preference. A. I believe that these two amendments make a substantial contribution to the bill. They eliminate my apprehensions with respect to the bill. If they are adopted and accepted by the committee. then I will be prepared to support this bill. because otherwise. -as I stated yesterday. the savings banks are In trouble and we do need legislation dealing with that.
970146095,"Mr. Speaker. today. I have introduced a resolution entitled ""American Salute to Cabanataun Prisoner of War Memorial Day"" with 75 original cosponsors. Forty years ago next month. 36.000 Americans were captured by the Japanese during the fall of Bataan and Corregidor in the Philippines in one of the most tragic episodes in World War II. Along with the Filipinos captured by the Japanese. these Americans were forced to mardh without food. water. or medicine for up to 10 days on the ""Bataan Death March"" to Camp ODonnell. an interim prisonerofwar camp. 10.300 peopleincluding women and children--died during that march. The survivors of this appalling march were then taken to Cabanataun (Cabanatawan) a prisonerofwar camp in central Luzon. Their treatment was extraordinarily cruel and inhumaneand 3.000 more people died at the hands of their captors between My of 1942 and February of 1945. Fl1 ally. on September 2. 1945. the remaining prisoners were liberated. Of the 36.000 who had been captured 3 years before. only between 6.000 and 7.000 survived to win their freedom. Today. 40 years later. there are 3.015 living survivors of this tragedy. For these Americans. I Introduced a resolution to honor their bravery and personal strength on April 12 of this year. Also President Ferdinand Marcos of the Republi.. of the Philippines (a Bataan survivor himself) has proclaimed April 12 as the ""Ruby Reunion for Peace."" in the Philippines and has invited all Americans who fought to defend the Philippines to return for a weeklong celebration of this important event in both our histories. He has also agreed to allow a memorial to be built in memory of the Americans who died at Cabanatuan. Though the memories are painful. it is important that we do not forget those who suffered such inhumanity during a tragic period in our history. Those survivors who are living as well as the families of those who did not survive will deeply appreciate our salute. The text of the resolution follows: H.J. REs. 435 Joint resolution providing for the designation of April 12. 1982. as ""American Salute to Cabanataun Prisoner of War Memorial Day"" Whereas. April 9. 1982. is the 40th anniversary of the fall of Bataan and Corregidor in the Philippines to the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. Whereas. approximately 36.000 Americans were captured by the Japanese at the fall. Whereas. these Americans. along with Filipinos captured by the Japanese. were forced to march without food and water for up to 10 days on the ""Bataan Death March"" to Camp ODonnell. a prisoner of war camp: Whereas. the International War Crimes Commission reports that 10.300 people. including women and children. died on that march. Whereas. the survivors of that march. along with other Americans and Filipinos captured by the Japanese in the Philippines. were taken to a prisoner of war camp in central Luzon named ""Cabanataun"". Whereas. the treatment of prisoners of war at Cabanataun was extraordinarily cruel and inhumane and resulted in the death of over 3.000 American prisoners of war during the period beginning May 1942 and ending February 1945. Whereas. the prisoners of war at Cabanataun w**re liberated on September 2. 1945. Wh areas. of the 36.000 Americans who were uaptured at the fall of Bataan and Corregidor. only between 6.000 to 7.000 survived until such date of liberation. Whereas. approximately 3.015 Americans who survived the Bataan Death March and imprisonment at Cabanataun are living today: Now. therefore. be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That the President is directed to issue a proclamation designating April 12. 1982. as ""American Salute to Cabanataun Prisoner of War Memorial Day"" and calling on the people of t.e United States to observe such day with ap. propriate ceremonies and activities."
970240126,Mr. Chairman. this amendment would prohibit the extension of a federally assisted loan If that loan would tend to increase the overall interest rate level in this country. Federal demands on the credit markets are an important factor in explaining the high interest rates that we have in slowing our economy for the last many months. In 1980 and 1981. over a third of all credit available In- the domestic markets was absorbed by the Federal Goverment. In 1982. It has been estimated that the Federal Government will take over onehalf of all of the available credit. In fact. one of the leading business magazines in our country recently estimated it would take over 70 i. percent of all available credit thi year. t The problem Is not just defici spending. Most of the credit absor tion comes from borrowing to suppor Federal and federally assisted loanm lending of the same sort that is foun In this bill. S This bill would authorize that sat type of lending that we are talkin about. The problem of absorption o credit has several components. For ex ample. In 1981 our deficit from over spendingalthough it is much large projected for this year and next yearwas $55 billion. At the samo time direct loans by the Federal Govern ment. loan guarantees. and loans by Governmentsponsored enterprlse such as FNMA cost us $86 billion It Stotal absorption from the entire credil *market. So as opposed to $55 billion in defi cits In 1981. we had $86 billion mora taken out of the credit nmarketplace bl loans. loan guarantees. and loans b . Governmentsponsored businesses. The interest rates we now experi. ence will not fall to acceptable level.. even though they have fallen to a great extent right now. They will not fall to an acceptable level and stay there until we get out of this enormous credit market crunch we are in at the present time on the availability of dollars in this country. There is a great need not only for reductions in the deficit. the absorption of money in this fashion. but also for the stopping of any increases in the Federal Government getting into the loan and credit market through that method or through the method of loan guarantees which are found in this bill. Now is not the time for an expansion of Federal credit. Reducing interest rates will do more for national security than a credit program like this could ever do.
970240146,Mr. Chairman. I would like to continue the comments of the gentleman from Arkansas and talk for Just a moment about the enormous problem that we have in considering interest rates in this country. We have interest rates which are the price of money. The price of mor.ey. just like any other good or commodity. is determined by the laws of supply and demand. When you have a limited supply of money and you are not creating more of it. and right now fortunately the Federal Reserve Board is not creating more. it is allowing for hopefully a moderate increase. but not a great increase in the supply of money. We have a limited supply of that money available. Then the question is. who gets what portion of that pie? When the Federal Government is absorbing. taking out of the marketplace 50 percent or better of all the money available. and some estimates say as much as 70 percent. there comes the crunch. the real reason why we have high Interest rates today. We need to get out of the money business. We need to reduce that pressure. One of the ways. of course. is by getting some commonsense in reducing our deficits far more than we have -today. A hundred billion dollar deficit. or whatever. regardless of whose deflcit it is. is too great. but the other way and the really big way we are talking about is by at least not expanding. and hopefully reducing. the results of pulling in money through this credit system. through the loans. the loan commitments. and the loan guarantees. That is what the heart of this bill is about and that is what the heart of this amendment is about. We do not need at this time to continue doing that in a time of high interest rates..There may be a time for these loans and loan guarantees and loan programs. We are not asking in this amendment that we reduce anything that already exists. All we are asking is that the Secretary of the Treasury be given the power to consider the factors that I have just laid forth in his wisdom and determination. just as he does in many otlier discretionary roles over in his. department in estimating this. that. or the other. in order that we do not have a further extension of credit. in order that we do not have a further taking away from the American people of the money that.right now ought to be in the marketplace so the interest rates will come down.
970247290,Mr. Speaker. further reserving the right to object. like many of my colleagues. I have witnessed an outpouring of frustration and anguish from victims of crime with whom I have spoken in my district. Clearly. there is an appropriate and necessary role for the Federal Government in addressing the problems encountered by crime victims. Not only does the Federal Government have a responsibility for the fair treatment of victims of Federal crimes. but it is clear that Federal lcgislation can serve as a model for the States. Based on suggestions from Senator PAUL LAxALT. who has demonstrated outstanding leadership on this issue for many years. the gentleman from New York introduced H.R. 6508 last spring. which I was pleased to cosponsor. The gentleman from New Jersey also introduced his own bill. H.R. 7191 conIututes a resolution of the differences between those two measures. Mr. Speaker. the gentleman has provided us with a most helpful description of the elements of this important legislation.. which I will not repeat at this time. However. I would like to touch upon some of the provisions and indicate my understanding of them. First. H.R. 7191 would revise and clarify Federal offenses relating to victim/witness tampering and retaliation and would expand those offenses in certain important respects. It is absolutely imperative that Federal law in this area serve as a strong deterrent to any intimidating activity aimed at a victim. potential witness. or person close to him. I believe that the penalties for such an offense. which H.R. 7191 substantially increases. should be strong. Furthermore. the civil restraint which the bill authorizes is a substantial preventive measure against this sort of horrifying activity. As the Wall Street Journal observed in a recent editorial. the authority for Federal judges to order restitution to victims. which is provided under H.R. 7191. makes such good sense that it is a wonder that legislation was not enacted long before this. Restitution represents the ultimate justicethe perpetrator of the crime must compensate the victim for the results of hib action. Under H.R. 7191. restitution could be ordered in cases arising under the Federal Criminal Code. which is found in title 18. or if the defendant has committed a skyJackingrelated offense. The latter represents a slight expansion from my original bill. which confined restitution to title 18 offenses. While I believe that the inclusion of skyjacking offenses is a valuable improvement in the bill. I firmly believe that restitution is not appropriate in connection with regulatory offenses. H.R. 7191. in my judgment. draws the line in an appropriate place and permits restitution only in cases where it makes the most sense. The restitution provisions of H.R. 7191 contain a logical limitation on awarding restitution. Specifically. they preclude a restitution order which would unduly complicate or prolong the Sentencing proceedings. Thus. for instance. restitution could not be ordered with respect to speculative lost future income. Such a determination could. however. be made in connection with a civil action. The guidelines which the Attorney General is required to promulgate will vastly improve the treatment experienced by Federal crime victims in the criminal justice system. The notion of insuring such fair treatment is based upon initiatives in Wisconsin. California. and New York. and will not unduly burden Federal law enforcement officers and prosecutors. Finally. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 7191 will require that Federal judges impose as a condition of pretrial release or release pending sentencing or appeal a condition that the defendant not engage in victim or witness harassment. As we all know. defendants too often use their release as an opportunity to intimidate those whose testimony may put them where they belongbehind bars. Under H.R. 7191. each Federal defendant will receive a warning upon his release that conduct of this reprehensible nature will lead to revocation of his release. Although Federal judges could impose such a condition under current law. it is not mandatory. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 7191 Is the product of the testimony received in both bodies. efforts in connection with Federal criminal code reform. and input from the administration. the American Bar Association. various business groups. victims organizations. and civil liberties groups. I was happy to learn that in a September 29 letter to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. the Assistant Attorney General expressed his strong support for H.R. 7191. This comports with the strong concern that President Reagan has expressed for the plight of crime victims. Mr. Speaker. it is imperative that we proceed with reasonable promptness toward addressing the needs of crime victims and demonstrating to them the compassion which they well deserve. I want to enthusiastically commend the gentleman from New Jersey
970274878,"After the national defense and the economy. there is no more Important issue facing our Nation today then gaining control of our borders and immigration reform. which is embodied In the debate over this legislation. . I find It to be tragic that we have waited this late in this session to bring up this bill at all so we could have this debate. Before commencing upon a discus sion of my views on the bill. after having served for nearly 2 years on this subcommittee. I want to personally extend my commendations to the chairman. the gentleman from Kentucky. to the ranking member. the gentleman from New York. and to the chairman of the full Judiciary Committee. the gentleman from New York. as well as the other members of the subcommittee who have labored for hours. toiled In the vineyard. to prepare for a moment which apparently is going to be very difficult to achieve if at all here in the 11th hour of this session. But I do believe that despite the fact that many people are home tonight or celebrating at Christmas parties somewhere. perhaps not listening to this debate. as they should. we need to have an airing of the issues before us. We need to remind each other and we need to bring to the American publics attention some of the basic facts about the problem at hand and the gravity of it. What we are talking about is the very quality of life of the American people. What we are talking about is the quality of life that we are going to have in this Nation in the future for our children and our grandchildren and for those to come. and whether or not that quality of life made for us by our ancestores Is carried forth by this generation to the next. so that we can have this great quality of life for the immigrants who do come here and for their relatives that they bring here to become new citizens. Now. with that said let us think about the precise nature of the problem. First of all. there has been said to be in excess of 12 million. perhapsnobody knows the figureillegal aliens in this country today. That alone is not the sole question. The problem is seen more clearly when we consider the fact that for about the last 3 years or so we have had about half of our population growth from immigration. either legal or illegal. and about half that or a quarter of the total growth of this countrys population from illegal immigration. We cannot absorb and assimilate that type of numbers of people coming across our borders. In addition to that fact. in some of the major hospitals in this country every year there are born thousands of children to illegal alien mothers who are not even counted in those figures because they are citizens upon the day they are born here in this country. The kinds of problems that are faced in not only my home State of Florida. but in many of your States. is a problem that simply cannot be ignored and brushed aside. Traditionally we have said let us continue to work on the problem of increasing the border patrol. working with a country such as Mexico from which the problem has come. And I encourage doing all of that. We have increased in this past year the number of border patrolmen and the iIlocations and resources. But I have been to the borders. I have been there as a member of this Subcommittee on Immigration. I am aware not only of the problems of my own State. with its water borders and boundaries. with the difficulties of managing them. but I have been in the State of California. to the border at Chula Vista. with the members of the subcommittee. and watched and looked and seen that it is absolutely impossible for us ever to expect to control the immisyration flow illegally into this country across our land and water borders if we are going to solely rely on the Coast Guard vessels and the border patrolemen. We. have got to have another solution. And that other solution is the heart and guts of this Immigration Reform Act. That portion of the bill which deals with employers sanctions is an absolutely essential ingredient to our ever being able to gain control of illegal immigration and to preserve and have some hope of having the quality of life for future generations that we have been so blessed to share. When we talk about employers sanctions. we are talking about making it illegal. to knowingly hire an illegal alien. What is embodied in that is not discrimination against those so concerned about it. It is in fact an opportunity for the first time to say to those who would come over here for a job because they have a poor economic condition in their country that we are not going to give them that magnet or that opportunity for that job. I submit to my colleagues and to those of the American public listening and watching tonight that this is absolutely the only way we have any hope of gaining control. I have no desire to snuff out the torch at the end of the Statue of Libety. I think we need to always have an orderly flow of immigration in this country. It is what has made our Nation gieat. where our forefathers by and large came from. with the exception of our great traditions of the American Indian. and we have an obligation to future generations to have that same orderly flow. But we must gain control of the runaway problem of illegal immigration. The second major feature of this bill that is terribly important is a complement to that. If we are going to. snuff out the opportunities to employ illegal immigrants for those who are employers in this country of what are today literally thousands and millions of illegal immigrants that are working in the fields and in the plants of our country. those employers who have come to depend upon the availability of this labor. while at the same time doing what this bill does. which is to provide a better opportunity for American citizens to gain employment. we are going to have to give them a hope for relief in those unusual circumstances that do arise when there are no reasonably available employees who are American citizens to do in a timely fashion the harvest of the crops and the taking of the chores at hand. And that is why the liberalization of the H2 program embodied in the committee bill from the Judiciary Committee is so important to be maintained. to allow an orderly flow of temporary workers into this country when that is indeed required to harvest the crops and to do the worl at hand.-And this bill provides that. The third very critical feature of this bill. in order to have an orderly immigration program. rests in the changes in the. adjudication part of the legislation. We in Florida particularly have experienced an extraordinary time where we have had our courts clogged and we have seen the failure of the current programs inside of the Immigration and Nationality Act to deal with processing those who seek political asylum and to handle the problems of exclusion and deportation. This bill sets up a procedure to expedite that process. While I do not fully agree with the final mannei in every detail and have offered legislation and amendments to further what I believe will be a speed up of the process. it is a vast improvement over what we have today and it is a portion of the. bill that I wholeheartedly support and I think is critical for us to do the other aspect that we do not treat in slowing down the flow into this country. and that is to get people who come here illegally and wrongfully claim the right to stay back out of the country again while still giving them due process. Now. the bill does have some deficiencies. I think the bill is gravely deficient in two respects. They do not deter me from supporting it. I think what is in it is overwhelmingly important and regardless of the outcome of any of the amendments dealing with the areas I am going to mention now. I wholeheartedly support this bill. One of the areas is the area of amnesty or legalization as it is technically called. I do not think that we should have that. I do not think that this country. as great a Nation as we are. can afford to legalize the vast majority of what may be as many as 12 million illegal aliens for any number of reasons. First of all. I think it is a slap in the face to those thousands. if not millions. who stood in line in countries around the world. waiting their turn to become legal immigrants to America. They have in fact. been denied that time after time because of the numbers and the caps and the regulations. And yet in this bill we would say to them those who broke the law and came here illegally. we are going to forgive. But that is not the worst part of this. that is just something that we should not be doing ethically and morally. What is really bad about amnesty is that while we cut off the magnet on the one hand of those who would come here to seek a job. with the employer sanctions. on the other hand. we come forward with an even greater magnet saying to those who are out there. ""If you really want to come to the United States illegally. come on over here. come on over here and in a couple years you are going to be granted amnesty. You are going to be grandfathered in. You are going to have an opportunity to become a citizen through the same processes as though you had waited in line all those years. You dont have to wait any more."" I can imagine what some of those people in line are thinking right now while we debate this bill. Some of them have not thought very much about it. They have come on over after they realized that we were serious about amnesty and saw what the other body did on the subject. In addition to the magnet effect that I believe would draw thousands. yes millions. across our borders if we pass the amnesty that is in this bill. I also believe it would be an enormous burden to the American taxpayer in many. many ways. because of the welfare that many of these folks would go on and the dollars required to be expended on additional school and additional hospital costs. additional costs for police. We have seen it in Florida In a very capsulized form in a short period of time with those who were there from the Cuban and Haitian immigration. We fortunately have in this bill provisions so that no individual State will bear the brunt of those costs. but the American taxpayers certainly will as a whole. I would urge those. if the opportunity arises. to -support an amendment that I fully intend to offer here. as I did in the subcommittee and in the full committee. to strike legalization from this bill. The horrors that have been expounded about rounding up folks and sending them back across the borders. If legalization does not occur. I submit are grossly exaggerated. They will not happen. What will happen is with employer sanctions in place. we will have an orderly attrition and a leaving of this country by many of those who are here already because they will not be able to get a job. They will not be able to keep the jobs that they. in fact. have when the seasonal employment ends and they move on. The last or second deficiency in this bill is not what is in it. but what is not in it. There is not a provision in this bill providing a full cap on immigration. We have today some very fine provisions of the law dealing with family reunification. and I really do not beg to argue that question. but what concerns me in large measure is th) fact that we do not have a true overall cap on those who are close family members and we have a lot of folks coming in in numbers that really the public is not.fully aware of legally. but more importantly. we do not have provisions to take into account what are known as seed Immigrants. We do not have a provision in our law today that actually in reality and in practice can account for those who would give special skills. for those who would be investors in this country and in this Nation of ours. who have in the past and under the law technically. normally. have a right in certain numbers to come here and to become citizens and to be productive and to lend to the great amalgum of this country. We do not have in practice that happening because the numbers available for immigration are being absorbed by the brothers and sisters in the family reunification portion of the Immigration Act. I submit that whatever we do in the future about changing the laws of legal Immigration. we need to consider giving an opportunity once again for us to have those seed immigrants that have been a foundation of America. regardless of the fact that some of them do not have the relative. the blood relative. already in this Nation. Now. that legislation will not be in this bill and I will not bring it up as an amendment and I doubt seriously that it will be considered. but it needs to be considered in the future. It has been in the Senate bill. It was in the original bill out of the subcommittee. In conclusion of imy primary remarks. I would like to say that I am disappointed that we did. in fact. wait so long. I am not disappointed at all in the leadership of our committee chairmen. I have already indicated how much I am proud of them and af the work they put in. but I am disappointed in the games that have been played. in the fact that many Members tonight were disgusted. On the vote on going into committee they voted not against the immigration bill. not against the cause that we are here for. but against the staying around in what appears to them to be a futile gesture to try to get a bill -up that is so important and to debate it at the 11th hour at night. I do not like doing any of that either. but I do believe that we need the opportunity to air this. It is such an important issue. I know that there have been games played and I know they may be played next year if this bill is not passed. I urge not only my leaders of the committees and of my party and the opposing party who dealt so long and so hard with it to bring this bill back again early and strongly in the next session if It does not succeed in this weekend and in the closing days. but I certainly urge the leadership at the higher levels of both our great parties. for the sake of our Nation. to give a full and fair and complete hearing on the floor of this House. with every Members opportunity to speak and to be heard on amendments on this great legislation in the next term should we not be able to conclude our business during this term. It is so important. I cannot overstress it. We can talk about crime and Jobs and employment and everything else that we have debated. I know they are important and I do not deny that for a minute. but I really was grievously concerned when I noticed that the hand was ticking down and we were taking up bills such as the Domestic Content bill as a protest demonstration. I suppose in large measure to the problems at hand. but which I think most of us realize could go no place in this session. Many said this could not go. but we never put this one up early enough to give it a chance to even remotely stand a chance to be voted on for final passage. I could name several other pieces -in this lameduck session that should not have been ahead of this bill. I pray again that we will take it up and we will consider it next session. if it does not pass this time."

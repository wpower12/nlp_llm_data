970018362,"Mr. Speaker. today. I have joined with my distinguished colleagues from Arkansas. Senator BUMPEns and Senator PaYon. in introducing legislation which would amend the Mineral Leasing Actacquired landsof 1976. The constituents of those Members who have in their districts military installations on acquired lands have a critical Interest in the outcome of this legislation which corrects an oversight and an inequity created by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1976. It appears that when the law was changed in 1976 to permit mineral leasing on military reservations a change should have also been made in the Mineral Leasing Act to permit a sharing of proceeds from leasing for oil and gas exploration on military reservations on acquired lands with the States and local governments where the leasing occurs. We are all aware that having a military installation in a communitywith its tax immunityplaces a burden on those local governments where the military reservation is located. Over the years. I have supported programs II 1281 aimed at compensating States and local jurisdictions for the tax moneys lost due to their having a military installation in their jurisdiction. However. as you know. in the majority of instances the revenues received under these programs do not begin to match the taxes which would be received if the property were held in private ownership. As we all can recognize. local people will often bear relatively severe burdens as a result of development of minerals which will be of national benefit in meeting our energy needs. These impacts can include suich things as a massive infusion of new workers with the attendant demand for increased services. which can strain the abilities of the local community to support them. In the past. Congress has recognized this problem by allowing States to receive 50 percent of the proceeds from mineral leasing on public domain lands within their borders. That same rationale should obviously pertain to allow States with acquired land for military reservations to receive similar benefits. In my own district. the Bureau of Land Management recently announced a recordbreaking oil and gas lease sale totaling over $43 million on lands within the Fort Chaffee military reservation in Arkansas. There is little question but that this is just a first of many such actions which may well eventually affect many communities across our Nation. At a time when local governments are being asked to pick up a larger share of ongoing programs. they should not concurrently be denied the opportunity of benefiting from those proceeds which are derived from mineral leasing on military reservations located in their jurisdiction. Briefly. let me summarize that the legislation introduced today will allow States to receive 50 percent of all rents. bonuses. and royalties received from mineral leasing on military reservations. The remaining portion will be divided as follows: 40 percent into the reclamation fund and 10 percent to the general fund of the Treasury. Please note that this is the exact same distribution formula provided for mineral leasing on public domain lands (30 U.S.C. 191). Furthermore. I commend for the review of my colleagues the comprehensive statement of Senator BUMPERS which will appear in todays RECORD detailing the legislative history of the Mineral Leasing Act and its direct relationship to the bills we have just introduced. A copy of the bill follows: H.R. 2990 A bill to amend the mineral leasing laws of the United States to provide for uniform treatment of certain receipts under such laws. and for other purposes Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That section 6 of the Act of August 7. 1947 (61 Stat. 915. 30 U.S.C. 355) is amended by adding the following at the end thereof: ""Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section. all receipts derived from leases on lands acquired for military or naval purposes. except the Naval Petroleum Reserves and National Oil Shale Reserves. shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States and disposed of in the same manner as provided under section 35 of the Act of February 25. 1920 (41 Stat. 450. 30 U.S.C. 191). in the case of receipts from sales. bonuses. royalties. and rentals of the public lands under that Act."" SEc. 2. The amendment made by this first section of this Act shall take effect with respect to leases entered into after January 1. 1981.0"
970060866,Mr. Speaker. I cannot think of anything that would be more helpful to older Americans today than to demystify the Issue of social security minimum benefits. The administration and Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate decided to eliminate the minimum benefit in the budget reconciliation process. This change was not undertaken without considerable research about Its potential effect on older citizens. Removal of the minimum benefit was recommended precisely because it is an unearned benefita welfare type of Income supplement that a recipient Is not entitled to from his or her payroll tax contributions. Maintaining these unearned minimum benefits will cost $7 billionputting unnecessary pressure on the already stresseoi trust funds. It Is Important here to recognize that there are two different kinds of minimum social security beneficiaries. One group of beneficiaries has worked for years under social security but at low wages. The formula that is used to determine their benefits Is purposefully weighted so that they can receive more than they actually should based on their payroll tax contributions. These longterm. lowwage earners receive benefits that are higher so that they can have a better standard of living after retirement. These people who have worked at least 19 years under the system are completely protected. as they should be. from any benefit changes. There is a second group of persons who receive a minimum benefit and who are the subject of current discussion. This group has. as a rule. worked for a short time under social security at high wages. Based on total lifetime earnings. the average individual receiving this minimum benefit could have paid less than $355 in social security payroll taxes over their lifetime and receive a benefit of $2.122 in 1982. This amount would also be increased annually to reflect changes in the CPI. In certain instances. a couple could receive at least $3.183 In 1982 by paying as little as $3 in payroll taxes over their entire working lifetime. It has been found that on the average. a husband and wife getting an initial minimum benefit in 1982 would be paid more than $100.000 during their retirement lifetime from the social security trust funds. For this average couple. that would be about 300 times what they paid into the system. These cannot be considered earned benefits. Now it is Important that we are all clear about those that will be affected by the change. There are presently 3 million persons receiving the minimum benefit. Research undertaken byf the General Accounting Office shows that only 17 percent of the minimum benefit recipients are truly needy and that 74 percent do not depend primarily on social security for retirement income. The General Accounting Office also estimates that 450.000 minimum beneficiaries are already receiving Federal pensions averaging $16.000 annually. In addition. 50.000 have retired spouses who are estimated to receive an average of $18.500 in Federal pensions and 300.000 have spouses who are earning an average $21.100. This accounts for 800.000 of the 3 million current minimum benefit recipients. Another 1.2 million are only technical minimum beneficiaries. Actually. these Individuals received more than the minimum benefit because they are entitled to dual benefitstheir total benefit payment is based not only on their own low earnings but on the earnings and social security taxes of their spouse. Their total benefit would be unaffected by elimination of the minimum benefit. Also In this group are 200.000 persons who have earned benefits that are equal to the minimum benefit. Because earned benefits would not be affected. these people would not lose any benefits. Of those receiving the minimum benefit. 500.000 are also receiving supplemental security income. which Is adjusted for receipt of other income. Therefore. those people who would lose the social security minimum benefit would have that same amount replaced under the SSI program. An important step was taken to eliminate possible hardships for many of the needy persons receiving social security minimum benefits. Under the present law. one is not eligible for SSI unless he or she Is 65. blind. or disabled. Under our new proposal. when the minimum benefit Is eliminated. people who are between the ages of 60 and 64 will be considered eligible for benefits under SSI if they meet other eligibility requirements. I think It is particularly Important to understand all these facts in light of -the charade undertaken by the Democrats In the House of Representatives. Today. the Democrats introduced a resolution that strongly urges that the necessary steps be taken to Insure that social security benefits are nor reduced for those currently receiving them. They did this knowing that this resolution is not binding and has no force to bring about any change. It was used in a partisan effort to improve the popularity of the Democratic Party. Statements were continually made that 3 million needy older persons would be hurt by the elimination of the minimum benefit eVen though this is clearly not the case. Beside the availability of SSI. needy individuals will also be eligible for other Federal programs such as food stamps and medicaid benefits. The administration and the Republican leadership of the House did not want to make this Important effort to improve the system an emotional and -partisan Issue. They did not want to be ~placed in a negative role for their attempts to strengthen the system for the wage earners. To diffuse this growIng bitterness. most Republicans including myself. will vote with the Democrats. In support of the resolution. In closing because of what I have Just said I will fully understand the proposal to eliminate the minimum July 21. 1.981 .CO] benefit because it Is not accomplishing the purpose for which it was originally Intended. Most of the people who receive it were not the low wage earners for whom It was developed. Moreover. many beneficiaries receive adequate income from other sources. I believe that it Is In the broader national Interest to stabilize the system and keep it viable for current and future beneficiaries. In doing so we must continue to honor our 46yearold contract wvith the American worker without jeopardizing senior citizens who depend on social security as their primary means of support. If high unemployment and high inflation continue to have a negative Impact on the social security system. we must attempt to correct the deficits by phasing in changes over a long enough transitional period to allow future retirees time to make appropriate plans. This resolution today is a charade.e
970077245,Mr. Speaker. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Mississippi . Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference agreement on the HUDindependent agencies appropriations- for fiscal year 1982. I compliment the conferees for bringing to the House an agreement with the other body that is approximately $2 billion below the amount which originally passed the House. I want to acknowledge the outstanding work of the chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. BOLAND. and the distinguished ranking minority member. Mr. GREEN of New York. I am especially pleased with that portion of the conference agreement that pertains to veterans benefits and services for the next fiscal year. The conference agreement includes approximately $330 million In outlays to restore a proposed cut of 5.181 staff years for personnel in the Veterans Administrations hospital and medical care program. You will recall. Mr. Speaker. that this amount was contained in the socalled GrammLatta amendment to the first concurrent budget resolution adopted by the House. This restoration of funds supports the recommendation of the Committee on Veterans Affairs and is consistent with the first concurrent budget resolution adopted by the House. Mr. Speaker. the Veterans Admninistration medical program cannot afford a reduction of more than 5.000 personnel and I am glad that the House and Senate conferees have agreed to restore the funds so that this reduction will not take place. As the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs has Indicated in his remarks. more than 800 beds and the VA hospitals have been closed because of a shortage of nurses. The conference agreement contains $4 million to be used for the implementation of the scholarship program which our committee Initiated and which the President signed into law last year. With this $4 million. the Veterans Administration should be able to mak~e commitments for at least 500 nurses who would be obligated to provide 1 year of service for each year of nursing school attended through the scholarship program. This is the best way we can eventually solve the longrange problem of a shortage of nurses which exists not only in VA hospitals but the private sector as well. I am very pleased that adequate funds have been Included In the conference agreement to take care of additional patients in community nursing homes. The conference agreement provides $1.716.000 to take care of an additional 200 patients who cannot receive treatment In VA nursing homes but may be taken care of through private community nursing facilities. Mr. Speaker. I certainly support the President in his efforts to reduce spending. and I am very pleased to take note of the fact that the conferees in the House and Senate in resolving differences on this particular bill. are proposing a reduction of approximately $2 billion from the amount approved by the House on June 26. 1981. This Is a substantial reduction and I am very much in favor of the savings that have resulted from the conference with the other body. I am convinced that if the agreement we are considering is enacted. veterans will continue to receive an adequate level of monetary benefits for disabilities incurred In service and will be assured that their medical needs will be met by a competent medical staff who operate our 172 hospitals. I urge the adoption of the conference agreement.
970088312,Mr. Speaker. further reserving the right to object. I am most pleased that we have resolved the differences with the other body on H.R. 3499. Most of the provisions of this bill remain essentially as they were when It passed the House on June 2. These Include a 3year extension of the readjustment counseling program for Vietnam veterans. a 9month extension of the authority of the Veterans Administration to provide contract medical care for veterans In Puerto Rico. the Virgin Islands. and other territories. priority medical care for Vietnam veterans who have disabilities which may be associated with the herbicide known as agcnt orange. expansion of the agent orange study. continued grants associated with medical care to veterans In the Republic of the Philippines. recovery rights for costs of VA medical care in cases of certain third parties who may be liable for such costs. maintenance of a certain number of hospital and nursing care beds In the VA medical system. and authorizing certain dependents to be treated in VA hospitals. Mr. Speaker. the other body passed a somewhat different version of this bill. It also added a provision extending authority for excepted appointments of Vietnam veterans to the Federal work force and extending the delimiting date under the GI bill for up to 2 years In certain instances where veterans were pursuing apprenticeships or other onthejob training. These two matters had already been approv6.i by the House in slightly different form by Its passage of H.R. 3423 also in June 2. The other body also added a section which slightly alters the requirement for -the previously mentioned agent orange study. It also added a technical amendment to existing law with respect to retirement credit for parttime employees of VAs Department of Medicine and Surgery. This amendment was requested by the administration. In the compromise. the House accepted the Senate additions. Mr. Speaker. the main areas of the compromise are as follows: First. veterans exposed to radiation will be added to the category of those who may be treated in VA facilities If VA doctors feel their disabilities may be asaociated with such exposure. Second. priority outpatient care will be given to Vietnam veteransahead of care for nonserviceconnected disabilities4!f the VA doctors feel their disabilities may be associated with agent orange. Third. with respect to the readjustment centers. it Is now provided that during the third year of their extension they will. for the most part. be phased into the mainstream of VA medical care. This will provide for an orderly transirion period. Fourth. the Philippine Republics grant. as originally contained In H.R. 3499. provided $500.000 annually to assist in replacement of obsolete equipment and repair of the physical plant of the Philippines Memorial Veterans Hospital. This authority will now be limited in each fiscal year to amounts specifically appropriated. Fifth. the Veterans Administration study on the effects of agent orange on veterans is expanded to include authority for the study of the adverse effects. If any. on veterans exposed to other herbicides. Sixth. H.R. 3499 as passed by the House called for the operation of a specific number of hospital and nursIng beds.* The compromise eliminates these separate requirements. It will now be required of the VA that It operate and maintain a total combined bed structurehospital and nursingof 90.000 beds. The Chief Medical Director of the Veterans Administration will annually review bed levels. national distribution of beds. and demographic characteristics. and report the results to the Congress each December Mr. Speaker. I am persuaded that the compromise reached with the other body Is a good one. I am pleased to support It. I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. Mr. MoN~caomERY. for his efforts in this regard. I also congratulate all of those who have worked so diligently to bring this bill to us for final passage.
970208228,Mr. Speaker. as a cosponsor of H.R. 1799. the Export Administration Amendments Act. I rise to express my strong support for this measure to encourage the development of export trading companies as middlemen to help small- and mediumsized U.S. firms sell their goods abroad. I commend my colleague. Congressman BONKER. chairman of the House Export Task Force. for his tireless efforts to insure passage of this critical bill which has been severely hampered by overlapping committee jurisdictions. I have long been enthusiastic about legislation to promote trade. Overseas trade is vital to the American economy. It is estimated that one out of eight jobs in the United States is directly dependent on exports. and that approximately $1 out of $3 of U.S. business profits is derived from international activities. Trade Is even more important for the agricultural sector. where 1 out of every 4 acres of cropland now produces for export. The continued expansion of foreign trade constitutes a major underpinning of American do. mestic prosperity. Small businesses which desire to export are often sidetracked by the tremendously burdensome requirements of such an effort. Gaining an expertise in foreign markets. tax provisions. freight handling. and business customs requires an indepth study and is tremendously time consuming. Whether selling directly or through an agent abroad. the small business also has to worry about export packing. longdistance multishipper transportation. export and import licenses. lack of trustworthy credit information. paper processing. payment insurance costs. and similar followup and detail work. A small business cannot afford the large inhouse international marketing staff which would be required to handle all aspects of a successful export effort. Because of these difficulties. many small suppliers turn to export management firms to handle their foreign sales. The majority of these professlonal middlemen operations are too small to handle more than one or two accounts competently. They also lack the management and capital necessary to expand geographically and to establish sales offices overseas. So. even if the export management firm is the best channel for a small supplier interested in exporting. he may still be frustrated in his export efforts. Governement export promotion programs have not been successful in filling this information gap or in providing the type or level of assistance necessary to aid small business exporters. Export association and trading companies currently in existence. while providing an alternative to direct exporting by small business. have been hamstrung by certain legal restrictions and ambiguities. Congress has done very little to promote the exports of U.S. goods and services. The vast Internal American market and a rich endowment of resources have enabled the Nation to remain relativry selfsufficient. Global events of 6he past decade. however. have led to dramatic changes. In 1970. for example. exports and imports of goods and services represented only 6.0 and 5.9 percent of U.S. GNP. respectively. By 1980. both exports and imports had grown to over 12 percent of GNP. These figures illustrate the Na.tions growing interdependence on the international economy and the importance of international trade to the expansion of the American economy. If the United States is to compete effectively in world markets. It must adopt policies that promote exports without abandoning the principles of the free market system. Export growth is clearly an increasingly Im. portant part of a healthy U.S. economy. yet the United States not only does little to spur exports. it actually erects barriers to increasing exports. Unfortunately. Federal laws and regulations limit our ability to respond effectively to these new challenges. For example. Government regulations prevent U.S. banks from offering many Important trading services. In addition. antitrust uncertainties deter many U.S. firms from cooperating with other U.S. producers In their organization of export activities. They hamper American firms at a time when foreign governments are cooperating with and. in many instances. even subsidizing and directing the export efforts of their own firms. The result is that our unilateral export restrictions cost American businessmen opportunities abroad and cost American workers jobs at home. One way in which we can do this is by facilitating the formation of trading companies. The trading company is not a new idea. It is as old as commerce itself and has enjoyed great success in other countries. In Japan. for example. the top 10 trading organizations. the Sogo Soshas. account for approximately 60 percent of Japans imports and 50 percent of its exports. Trading companies have also played an important role in the economic growth of Many European countries. Yet. despite their historical and international success. trading companies have not flourished in the United States. The bill before us attempts to improve this situation. It makes possible the formation of American export trading companies to deliver the output of small- and mediumsized American businesses to the marketplaces of the world. I must point out that even though U.S. exports have grown in the 1970s from 4.3 percent of our GNP to 8 percent today. we are in fact losing ground in the growing overseas markets. The U.S. share of the total world market in 1970 was 15 percent. in 1980. it was 12 percent. The U.S. share of the manufactured goods total world market has gone from 21.3 to 17.4 percent. Every other major trading nation not only permits but encourages the formation of export trading companies or their equivalent. Only the United States has failed to allow the development of this mechanism for aiding smaller firms who either cannot or will not enter the world marketplace on their own. It appears that the export trading company will be the major exportexpanding statute that can be enacted this year. Its passage today requires the active support of all Members of Congress concerned with the balanceofpayments problem and its implications for the economic. political. and military future of the United States.*
970223516,Mr. Chairman. during our hearings to consider H.R. 6100 and other legislative proposals under the jurisdiction of the Economic Development Subcommittee we received testimony on the impact of DavisBacon legislation on the cost of Federal construction projects and its effects on local contractors. At that time. we heard testimony from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. the American Farm Bureau. the National Federation of Independent Business. the Associated Buildings and Contractors and the Associated General Contractors. Every witness spoke of the overwhelming extra expense tacked onto Federal construction costs as a result of DavisBacon legislation. Estimates ran as high as $2 billion per year. But to take the most conservative estimatethat proposed by a group of House Democrats. the Conservative Democratic Foruman estimated outlay savings of $560 million would have occurred in fiscal year 1982 from the repeal of DavisBacon. To put this figure in perspective. the Federal Government could recoup the entire authorization for H.R. 6100 and more by repealing DavisBacon. The American Farm Bureau testified that a scientific study conducted by Oregon State University reached two highly significant conclusions: First. in a study of 215 projects in 100 counties. costs were from 26 percent to 38 percent higher on federally funded projects as compared to similar buildings built in the same counties during the same 2 years by the private sector. Second. local contractors were used on 47 percent of the privatenonDavisBaconprojects. but only on 28 percent of the federally aided projects. Contractors on the DavisBacon projects more often came from adjacent counties or even further away. and were more likely to come from an urban center. The unavoidable conclusion from this data is that DavisBacon does increase the construction cost of federally funded projects and is actually working to the detriment of those whom it was designed to protectthe local contractors. I believe the only total solution to the problems created by DavisBacon is its repeal. However. one modification has been proposed by my colleague Mr. HAGEDORN. which would go a long way toward ameliorating the negative effects of this provision in H.R. 6100. Basically. this amendment would waive the DavisBacon requirement only when at least a 10percent savings of tax dollars would result. It would call for this exemption when the winning bid on an EDA project comes in at least 10 percent lower than the next lowest bid. Of course. if the full 10 percent cannot be saved the DavisBacon requirements remain in effect. I appreciate this opportunity to bring into focus the severe impact of DavisBacon legislation on EDA. and urge adoption of the Hagedorn amendment.
970246385,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 6457. the Health Research Extension Act of 1982. This legislation is extremely important. not only because it sets authorization levels for the operation of the National Institutes of Health over the next 3 fiscal years. but also because it represents. this bodys commitment to the ongoing functions of health research programs. As a member of the Select Committee on Aging. I am aware that one of the concerns uppermost in the minds of older persons is their health. It is unfortunate that there are many illnesses affecting the elderly and the general population today for which there is no known cure. Arthritis. for example. afflicts 37 million people in this country. Continued biomedical research in this area is sorely needed. H.R. 6457 creates a new National Institute on Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases which will hopefully make new inroads in the quest to prevent the onset and advancement of this devastating and crippling disease. One of the most significant provisions in this bill is the authorization for the National Cancer Institute. This is especially relevant because of the. documented increase in the incldence of cancer with age. It is not clear whether agerelated changes lead to cancer or whether aging and cancer stem from a common process or processes. Continued research will surely contribute to a more advanced understanding of both aging and cancer and their relationship. as there has been relatively little cross study to date in these fields. Of equal importance to the elderly is the new emphasis on longrange disease prevention programs. Twentyfive centers will conduct vital research in the prevention of illness and the promotion of good health. Data shows us that more people are living to old age and that the fastest growing segment of our population Is those over age 75. Currently. 86 percent of the elderly over the age of 65 have at least one chronic condition. With an emphasis on basis preventive research. we can have serious hopes of improving the health and quality of life for those beyond the age of 65. Mr. Chairman. I believe we can do no better than to approve this legislation. for ourselves and for future generations of healthy Americans.e
970257032,Mr. Chairman. as a member of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee who has actively supported the revitalization and expansion of our highways to be funded through the equivalent of a 5centpergallon increase in the highway user fee. I regret that I must rise in opposition to the bill in the form it appears before us today. My objection to this proposal centers on title V of the bill relating to increased taxes on tires. tread rubber. and trucks. Our Nations trucking industry is still reeling from the combined effects of the Motor Carrier Deregulation Act of 1980 and depressed economic markets. This combination has produced a financial condition that saw two out of three regulated motor carriers losing money in the fourth quarter of 1981 and the first quarter of this year. Carriers as a whole barely broke even for the first 6 months of this year. A financially ailing industry cannot afford skyrocketing tax increases. It is interesting to note that in 1982. the entire regulated trucking industry will have a net. Income of less than onehalf of 1 percent. The total cost of the increases advocated in this legislation approximates 10 times this projected income. Basically. this measure would increase total taxes on a typical 18wheel truck from $1.746 to about $4.000 per year. The rationale for these increased taxes is based upon a study which related virtually all highway damage to weight and ignores the effects of weather. environment highway maintenance and chemicals. Such a high increase in taxes would be untenable at any time. but under the current economic situation in the trucking industry they become confiscatory. Originally intended to spur productivity. if this proposal prevails it will hamper employment efforts in the trucking industry and have a ripple effect on related industries such as truck and trailer manufacturers. tire manufacturers and manufacturers of truck equipment and components. The employment gains in the construction industry through the highway program will surely be offset by the employment losses in the transportation network. Moreover. these provisions come to the floor without substantiation from a complete hearing record on the merits and demerits of singling out one segment of our transportation system to face an undue share of the tax burden which eventually will be passed on to consumers through increased shipping costs. In addition. Congress should investigate the impact of tire tax modifications on highway safety and Korean tire imports. The truck size and weight increases in H.R. 6211 can do their part in help. ing alleviate the present condition by allowing carriers needed productivity increases. But. excessive taxes in H.R. 6211 would wholly offset any productivity gains and further depress the industrys financial condition. Even if the tax increases were based on a highway cost allocation method that was defensible. which it is not. they represent cost increases that could not possibly be absorbed. It is implied that the tax increases that are recommended can be passed on to the consumer through increased freight charges and. therefore. we should not be alarmed. I cannot accept such a cavalier treatment of what the consumer can or cannot be called upon to pay. The pervasiveness of motor truck service. because of the role it plays in freight transportation. is such that increased costs of truck transportation mean increased costs to the consumer. This is not time to talk about increased consumer costs when we are finally bringing inflation under control. But the major point is that increased costs of any magnitude have no place in our economy when they are based on a misguided approach to highway cost responsibility calling for a punitive assesstnent of taxes against the trucking industry. resulting in increased costs of everything we eat. wear and use. The trucking industry has never disputed its responsibility for extra tax payments for extra highway facilities its vehicles require. However. there is no basis in terms of highway use or highway responsibility to justify such a high tax assessment against the larger vehicles. The Department of Transportation (DOD) maintains that a tax level such as this against the larger truck is justified by a highway cost allocation study. But. if you look at this study carefully. you will find that the tax proposal was based on the premise that truck traffic in virtually the sole cause of highway wear and tear. Any competent highway engineer will tell you that among the major causes of highway deterioration are the weather. the environment and age. All highways need resurfacing or reconstruction. regardless of truck traffic. This is borne out by the experience of highways that trucks never use. such as the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut. and the southern portion of the Baltimore Washington Parkway. Both of these road sections needed major repair. or resurfacing within their design life. of approximately 20 years. Yet. they never carried truck traffic. If the DOT highway cost methodology is correct it means that highways that never carry truck traffic will last forever. This is ridiculous. We are talking about a tax increase of close to $2 billion in taxes on an industry which at this time is in its worst financial condition since the Great Depression. Voting against the excise tax increases related to trucks is not possible under the rule we adopted so I will vote against title J in the hopes that the Committee on Ways and Means would come up with a cost allocation package which is more equitable than the one before us today.e
970279729,"Mr. Speaker. reserving the right to object. and I do not plan to object. I rise in support of H.R. 7159. This legislationin its original form passed by the House and in its amended version from the Senateprovides an environmentally preferred means of dealing with a clean water situation in northern California. The ranking Republican member of the Committee on Public works and Transportation. DON CLAusEN. deserves full recognition for his efforts in bringing this matter to the attention of the Members of the committee and the Congress. The local community. including environmental interests. remain strongly supportive of this action. . The legislation permits discharge of nontoxic materials by two mills into the ocean as had been approved by the State of California prior to that decision being overturned by the Environmental Protection Agency. . As was noted when this bill first passed the House. discharge to the ocean has not caused nor will cause harm because of the ocean characteristics. In fact. failure to allow these discharges will lead to environmental problems because of the need to dispose of large quantities of sludge. related air pollution problems. and others. In addition. the expenditure of large sums of money on unnecessary facilities by the companies will certainly be economically harmful in this time of economic recovery. The bill. as it passed the House was environmentally sound and economically reasonable. The Senate amendments merely ""fine tuned"" the provisions. For instance. one of the Senate amendmentsNo. 9provides that competitors with facilities comparable to the applicant have the opportunity to demonstrate that they would be put at a competitive disadvantage. The Senate report properly notes that the burden for such a showing is on the competitor. If no competitors come forward. this provides the evidence that there is no competitive disadvantage created. Again. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 7159 provides for appropriate action in this particular case and is in keeping with the goals of the Clean Water Act and will provide the- best overall environmental results. I support this legislation and urige my colleagues to support It as well. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey . the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. for further explanation."

980066764,"for the leadership he has demonstrated in continuing to bring before Congress this legislation declaring the birthdate of Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. a national holiday. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. lived a life dedicated to the realization of a true democracy. where every man and woman would be considered equal before the law. Today we no longer allow historians to seek only the contributions of ""White Americans"" or ""Black Americans."" We demand that our historians record the contributions of great Americans. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. was a great American. He was a great American during a period when America herself was not as great a nation as it should have been insofar as her people of color were concerned. He was a great American during a period when poet Langston Hughes appropriately reminded us of the black mans American heritage in. ""I. too. sing America."" Since the founding of our Nation. great Americans have spoken of their visions. dreams. and prayers for Amer. ica. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. shared with us his dream 20 years ago. Today his greatness is even more apparent and his words continue to urge us on the make America the America it was meant to be. Whether spoken from outside a ""Whites only"" restroom..the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial. the front of a bus. or in a county jail. they remind us of the undeniable oneness that we share with each other. They remind us that in 1983. ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" They remind us that in 1983. we remain ""* * * caught in an inescapable network of mutuallity. tied to a single garment of destiny."" and they remind us in 1983 that ""Whatever affects one directly. affects all indirectly."" A holiday in commemoration of the birthday of Dr. King would set aside a time for this Nation to celebrate the American experience. This day will celebrate a mana man who contributed immeasurably to the continued dedication of this free Nation and to the principles upon which it was founded. The words of Martin Luther King are not dead. The problems he discussed have not disappeared. Martin Luther King woke this Nation to its moral and constitutional responsibilities. His dream for our American democracy is one that is shared by millions of men and women in this country. black and white. rich and poor. young and old. In honoring Dr. King by establishing a national holiday. we bring honor to all Americans who share that dream and the vision of a just and ethical America.*"
980098603,"Mr. Speaker. Dr. Frederick G. Sampson is pastor of the. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church In the city of Detroit. one of the citys leading congregations. He grew up in. Louisville. Ky.. where his father was a minister. He excelled in theological study. earning degrees at Howard University and his doctorate in divinity from the Virginia Theological Seminary. A national and international scholar and lecturer at numerous colleges and universities. Dr. Sampson recently published a book. entitled ""The Romance of Theology In the Black Experience."" Reverend Sampson exemplifies many extraordinary traits of intellect and character. He Is devoted to his congregation. the community in which he lives and works. and the city of Detroit where he serves on a number of boards and commissions. He is down to earth and always accessible. He also Is an orator of the first rank. But even beyond these qualities. I. consider his greatest strength is the sense of misSion and commitment he has brought to his church in applying the Gospel to everyday life and to the solution of human and community problems. Under his guidance the Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church has become Involved In every pressing social Issue. His church has reached out to young people and found them work. joined with community groups to improve the quality of housing and public services. and has come to the assistance of families In need. For his extraordinary leadership and service in the community and the Nation. the Detroit branch of the National Association of Colored Womens Clubs honored Dr. Sampson on Saturday. April 30. 1983. with a luncheon In Detroit. On that occasion. a proclamation of commendation was given him. a copy of which I have included In this statement. I am also pleased that Reverend Sampson has been invited by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives to serve as a guest chaplain. an occasion I looked forward to with great satisfaction. I can think of few other human beings and leaders who so deserve the honors accorded them."
980126656,Mr. Chairman. the fair practices in automotive products bill is an appropriate and wellconceived response to the conditions existing within the auto Industry. Working men and women In the auto industry have shouldered the major burden of poor management decisions. the flight of capital and production abroad. and the flood of imports. While industry sales have improved somewhat during thle past several months.. the industry Is still vulnerable and in tre~nsition. More time is needed to safeguard its viability. thle economic strength of local communities where auto production occurs. and the jobs of auto workers. several hundred thousand of whom continue to be unmployed. The domestic auto content bill now before the House hans been Judged by its critics to be too strong a medicine. There are times. however. when only strong medicine can cure a longclvcloping condilt -n of dzclinie. The Chrysler loan guarantee pickage enacted in 1079 ran into many of the same argilments now used against the domestic auto content bill. Yet the rebirth of the Chrysler Corp. has demonstrated that whole chunks of American Industry need not be abandoned or put uip for sale while other Industrial powers continue to manke enormous inroads Into domestic markets. In the past 5.years. over 700.000 jobs In automobile production and related industries have disappeared. After a year of socalled economic recovery from what was the worst tailspin since the Great Depression. unemployment still stands at record levels. More than 200.000 auto workers remain unemployed as well as more than 500.000 employees in related manufacturing and service fields. Historically. the auto industry has been a bellwether sector in terms of Jobs. wages and labor standards. technology. and stimulus to production In other key industries. Despite current unused capacity. the auto industry still consuimes more than 20 percent of the steel In use. 50 percent of the malleable iron. and 60 percent of the synthetic rubber. The Industry employs nearly 5 million workers in manufacturing. among suppliers. and through sales and service. It sustains over 50.000 small businesses and In the aggregatte accounts for 9 percent of total domestic goods production value. Americas auto industry. like so much of the rest of heavy industry. i.9 undergoing profound changes. The industry Is automating and down sizing and this will result in further job loss. The auto sector is In a race to catch uip with the Japanese. whose widerangIng governmental supports. lower wage rates. and greater efficiency has provided them with a competitive edge for years to come. Japans tax laws. for example. forgive domestic commodity taxes on their auto exports. which is equivalent to an export subsidy. The undervaluation of the Japanese yen alone gives the Japanese another $600 or so advantage. Wages In Japans auto industry are roughly $8 an hour lower than in the United States. at a time when Japanese subcompacts are assembled In nearly half the time required to assemble a comnparable American car. When all of these advantages are factored in. It appears the Japanese can build cars. on the average. at between $1.700 and $2.200 less than U.S. manufacturers. The domestic content bill is criticized on three grounds. Critics allege it would generate retaliatory action. create only a negligible number of new jobs. and reduce industry competition. resulting In higher prices and slackened sales. Thle assumption that Japan would retaliate is not sustainable by recent experience. Why would the Japanese abandon the worlds most lucrative auto market? Where would they turn. furthermore. for their vast imports of agricultural product Ions. lumber. and minerals? In fact. the Japanese never have retaliated aliinst the European nations that have imposed far harsher import quotas than ours. Over 20 nations currently apply local content requirements. Including the Japanesp. and this has% never caused any major trade difficulty. Though the British. French. and Italians severely limit Japanese auto inports. the Japanese have never filed a single complaint against them under the GATT agreement. The argument that the bill would result In a negligible number of new jobs or even a net Job loss. reflects thle unrealistic assumptions of a trade war. Without this assumption. there is general agreement that this legislation would. In fact. create and preserve several hundred thousand jobs. including those saved in curbing the outsourcing of auto parts production by U.S. auto makers for domestic use. The bill does not affect at all the ability of U.S. automakers to build auto parts overseas for the units sold abroad. The domestic auto content bill Is designed to stimulate domestic auto finvestment and competition. not to retard it. Past experience amply demionstrates that the threat or achievement of Import quotas by European common market countries spurred the Japanese to build auto production facilities In those countries. Hlonda. for example. decided to locate an assemtbly operation in Great Britain only after the British banned Japanese finports over a 5month period. Similarly. mounting American pressures have spurred Ithe Japanese to locate auto plants In the United States and to uindertake coproduction arrangements. According to a recent Commerce Department publication. the import share of the U.S. auto market is4 expected to climb by the decades end to 40 percent or more. unless current policy is changed. The -voluntary restraint agreement Initiated by the Japanese is useful. but of limited value and duration. Given the continued growth in Japanese imports. they should be prodded to undertake larger investments in U.S. domestic auto production. The legislation before uts will stimulate competition by compelling the Japanese and other auto importers to build more plants in the United States. so that competition with domestic auto makers will be more direct and take place here where Americn automobile workers can find Jobs. The domestic auto content bill Is an appropriate remedy to spur domestic Investment and protect jobs during this critical transitional period. It sends a realistic signal to others that the United States is serious about protecting its industries. communities. and working people. To be sure. this legislation alone cannot solve all aspects of the problem. An easing uip of monetary policy clearly would boost the auto Industrys sales and employment. A compreher. iva and welldc. signed Industrial policr Including Industrial councils and development bank... Is long overdue In order to bring some coherence and farsightedNovember 3. 1.983 ness to economic policy. It Is time. however. to give priority to our own workers. our industrial communities. and our vital Industries. and this can be done for auto3 by supporting the fair practices In automotive products domestic content legislation.*
980161922,Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to outline for my colleagues the activities planned for the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice during the next 2 months. It may be necessary. because of the unavailability of important witnesses or for other unforeseen circumstances. to adjust this schedule. but I hope the subcommittee will be able to adhere closely to it. The subcommittee has two major projects. well underway and will continue to work on each of them. The subcommittee has held two hearings on H.R. 3498 and related bills to help crime victims. Four more are planned. I hope to be able to begin markup in early April. but whether this is possible will depend in large part upon when the administration sends Congress its proposed legislation to implement recommendations of the Presidents Task Force on Victims of Crime. The task force issued its final report in December 1982. but the administrations proposed legislation has not yet been forwarded to the Congress. I am informed that it will soon be sent to Us. The second major project involves sentencing practices and procedures. The subcommittee has held two hearings on sentencing reform legislation and pne on fine collection methods. Four more hearings on sentencing reform legislation and one more hearing on fine collection have been planned. Markup of legislation on each topic will begin after the hearings on that topic are completed. In addition to working on crime victim and sentencing practices and procedures. the subcommittee will begin work on several matters that were addressed by the other body during consideration of 8. 1762. its omnibus crime bill. The subcommittee i not free. however. to take up any provision in that bill. To begin with. some of the provisions in 8. 1762 deal with matters not ordinarily within the jurjsdiction of the Committee on the Judicary. Title VIII of the bill amends statutes like the Labor Management Relations Act. 1947. which is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Labor. Title IX of the bill amends provisions in title 31 of the United States Code. which are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Banking. Finance and Urban Affairs. Moreover. the subcommittee does not have jurisdiction over all of the provisions in 8. 1762 that are within the ju-
980169129,"Mr. Speaker. Clarence M. Mitchell. Jr.. who died Sunday at the age of 73. was a giant in American law and politics. Embodied in this single individual was virtually the entire machinery of civil rights advocacy over a period spanning four decades. In the 1940s Mitchell persuaded President Harry Truman to issue executive orders barring racial discrimination. such as the order desegregating the Armed Forces. He also was prominent in bringing fair employment practices to Federal employees. In the 1950s and 1960s he shaped and shepherded through Congress one major civil rights bill after another including the Civil Rights Act of 1957. the Civil Rights Act of 1964. the Voting Rights Act of 1965. and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. During the 1970s as director of the NAACPs Washington bureau and head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. Mitchell championed the enforcement of equal employment opportunity. the idea of which he initiated as author of title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Law. He was a major force in winning reauthorization of key civil rights programs. including voting rights. fair housing. and Jobs and urban redevelopment as they impacted on the quality of life for minority citizens. Clarence Mitchell pioneered in civil rights at a time when few others were actively involved. He devoted his lifes work to the civil rights cause. staying with it through thick and thin. never wavering in his leadership regardless of the odds. He was one of those rare human beings who knew what was worthwhile to do. knew how to go about doing the job. and knew how and when to stand his ground when the outcome was in question. Many Washington insiders were accustomed to viewing Clarence Mitchell as ""the 101st U.S. Senator."" That was a tribute. of course. to his powerful example arid influence. that carried so much weight in Government. In fact. Mitchell really constituted a shadow government of one when it came to civil rights Jaw and policy. He did not want the publicity and acclaim. yet without Clarence Mitchell so much decent law and positive policy would never have arisen and so much injustice would continue to go unheeded. We should be mighty grateful for his lifes work and we will miss him profoundly.e"
980179204,Mr. Speaker. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this special order in recognition of National Library Week. sponsored by my colleague MAJOR OWENs. Libraries are a vital resource in our communities and hold a vast potential for both scholarship and entertainment. They are an institution upon which we all depend to store the worlds treasures of thought and make them available to all without question or cost. Today. our Nations libraries ae faced with a possible cutback in Federal funding support. Although Federal funds account for only about 5 percent of public library support. it is a critical 5 percent used to reach that part of the population without library services. or for whom the provision of library services requires extra effort. The Library Services and Construction Act. which passed the House on January 31. 1984. authorized $150 million for grants to assist States in the extension and improvement of library services for the physically handicapped. the institutionalized. bilingual. and older persons. The Reagan administration. however. proposes that this program be eliminated. thereby further reducing Federal assistance to the disadvantaged. In my congressional district. the Detroit Public Library has used moneys received under this program to enhance services to the handicapped and to increase its collection of foreign language materials. In addition. the funds have been used to improve the accessibility of libraries to the handicapped through new construction. Finally. cooperation between the various types of libraries has been enhanced. None of these things could have been accomplished without this Federal funding support. As the Senate debates this important piece of legislation. we must help them understand the need for continued Federal support of our libraries. The moneys to be authorized should be viewed as an investment. the return on which will manifest itself in the achievements *of all present library users. and most certainly those who will use library resources in future generations.*
980236909,"Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5846. reported without dissent by the Committee on the Judiciary. revises Federal procedures for the thiposition and collection of fines in criminal cases. The Judiciary Committee concluded in 1980. when it reported the Criminal Code revision bill. that existing fine levels ""Do not adequately provide the Judiciary with sufficient flexibility to impose sentences that will adequately deter future criminal conduct."" That statement is true today. H.R. 5846 attempts to make the criminal fine a more effective criminal sanctionand thus a more attractive alternative to imprisonmentby authorizing Federal courts to Impose higher fines. The bill permits a court. in imposing a fine. to choose the greatest of three alternatives: First. the amount specified in the provision defining the offense. Second. an amount equal to twice any pecuniary gain derived from the offense or twice any pecuniary loss inflicted as a result of the offense. Third. if the conviction is for a felony. or a misdemeanor resulting in death. $250.000 for individuals and $1.000.000 for organizations. and if the conviction is for a misdemeanor punishable by more than 6 months imprisonment. $100.000 for individuals and $250.000 for organizations. Equally important. the bill also sets forth factors that the court must consider in determining whether to Impose a fine and the amount of a fine. These factors include such things as the seriousness of the offense. the defendants criminal history. the defendants ability to pay. and the need to deprive the defendant of any illegally obtained gains. Considering the defendants ability to pay is particularly important. with the higher fine levels. there is a potential for abuse. This consideration should also result in more realistic fines. which will improve fine collection. H.R. 5846 also enhances the ability of the Justice Department to enforce fines. The bill provides that a judgment imposing a fine is a lien on the defendants property. The lien. moreover. is a ""super"" lien. applying to all property to which a Federal tax lien would apply and having the priority of a Federal tax lien. Under current law. the State law regulating exemptions and priorties controls and. in probably every instance. will not be as favorable to jucdgment creditors as Federal Tax Code is to the Federal Government. Thus. the bill gives the Federal Government. in its status as a fine judgment creditor. greater standing than other judgment creditors. In the unlikely event that State law is more favorable than the Federal Tax Code. the bill provides that State law will govern. The bill makes willful nonpayment of a fine a misdemeanor but provides a defense. which defendants must establish by a preponderance of the evidence. that the failure to pay the fine was caused by their responsibility to provide necessities for themselves or for others financially dependent upon them. Like U.S. Circuit Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat. who testified before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice on behalf of the Judicial Conference. I am somewhat dubious of the need for this provision. It will be hard for the Justice Department. with its beefedup ability to enforce fines. not to collect a fine. so I would expect prosecutions under the provision to be quite rare. This bill differs from that reported by the Judiciary Committee in only one respect. An amendment has been added to require that persons who are permitted to defer payment of a fine. or to pay in installments. pay interest on the outstanding balance at the rate of 1.5 percent per month. This bill is the result of a good deal of work by two of our colleagues. the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. BouCIERI and the gentlewoman from Illinois . The gentlewoman introduced legislation on this subject and made a very effective presentation on Its behalf at hearings held by the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice. The gentleman from Virginia. a member of the subcommittee. did a most skilllful job in fashioning a new bill that dealt with legitimate concerns voiced at the hearings. Mr. Speaker. I urge support for the bill. This measure that will strengthen the capability of the Justice Department to collect criminal fines and will make fines a sterner punishment. This. in turn. will make fines a more effective alternative to imprisonment."
980236947,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself stch time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5919. reported without dissent by the Committee on the Judiciary. will facilitate the preecution of criminals who use offshore banks for the laundering of profits and the evasion of taxes. What this costs the Federal Government each year is hard to say. but the Internal Revenue Service estimated when testifying before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice that use of offshore tax havens costs billions in taxes annually. Federal prosecutors confront serious difficulties in both the investigatory and prosecution stages of a case involving the use of offshore banks. The procedures that must be undertaken in foreign countries to obtain necessary records are time consuming. and defendants frequently seek to block prosecutors requests. sometimes by initiating formal action in another country without informing the prosecutor. The time consumed in obtaining these records creates several problems. First. the statute of limitations may run before the prosecutor can obtain records necessary to get an indictment. Second. Speedy Trial Act deadlines can be missed if the records cannot be obtained in time. Finally. getting the records admitted into evidence can be a problem. The custodian of the records must. under the Federal rules of evidence. testify about the manner in which the records are kept. Almost invariably the custodian will be a resident and national of a foreign country and not subject to subpoena by the Federal courts. While it is possible to take he custodians deposition overseas. the procedures for doing so are costly and time consuming. H.R. 5919 addresses some of these problems facing Federal prosecutors. First. H.R. 5919 permits a Federal court. at the request of a Federal prosecutor. to suspend the running of the statute of limitation for up to 3 years if necessary to enable the prosecutor to obtain evidence located in a foreign country. Second. the bill permits a Federal court. at the request of any party to a criminal case. to suspend Speedy Trial Act deadlines for up to 1 year in order to allow the party to obtain evidence located in a foreign country. Third. the bill makes foreign business records admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if the custodian of the records furnishes a certification attesting to the authenticity. and the manner of keeping. of the records. The certification must be executed under penalty of perjury. and the couzt.*es the discretion not to admit the redbrds if it finds that the manner in which they were kept makes them untrustworthy. Fourth. the bill requires U.S. nationals and residents. and all parties to Federal criminal cases. to serve upon the prosecutor any papers formally filed in another county in oppositor to an official request by the prosecutor for evidence located in that country. Finally. the bill authorizes Federal courts to appoint special masters to preside over. or act as an advisor on U.S. law to the official presiding over. a deposition taken in a foreign country. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5919 has the support of the Justice Department. Similar provisions have been passed by the other body as part of S. 1762. the omnibus crime bill. I am unaware of any opIposition to the bill. and I urge its approval.
980252951,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 5609. the American Defense Education Act. This bill represents a positive first step in addressing a serious national problem acknowledged by all: The declining state of education in America. particularly in the areas of math and science. This disturbing trend is attributable. in part. to a neglect of the qualifications of the Nations educators. The National Science Teachers Association estimates. for instance. that 60.000. or 28 percent. of the Nations 200.000 math and science teachers lack the needed qualifications for the competent instruction of our Nations students. While the current administration sounds alarm at the current state of American education. it has ironically reduced Federal spending on education from $7.7 billion in fiscal year 1981 to $5.7 billion this current fiscal year. The administrations policies of block grants have been particularly devastating to the urban poor and minority communities where. according to all statistics. the need is greatest. In Detroit. for instance. where study after study has demonstrated the direct link between public educational deficiencies and the lack of Federal commitment. funding was reduced under. the block grant by nearly 50 percent. from $7.3 million to $3.8 million. In the administrations policieta of reverse logic. it has failed to see that education cuts are cuts that never heal. Most recently. the Presidents National Commission on Excellence in Education has estimated that $14.2 billion in additional public education expenditures are needed to reverse the steady decline in education which the Nation has witnessed over the past two decades. By appropriating $2 billion. the American Defense Education Act would initiate the first step down a road on which we have been all too reluctant to pioneer. Apart from training educators and upgrading materials in the areas of math and science. foreign language instruction. communications skills and technology. the scope of H.R. 881 reaches beyond even the new mnathscience assistance law by providing communication and linguistic skills to facilitate mutual exchange of information and knowledge with people from different countries and cultures. In a world increasingly dominated by international trade. advances in science are irrelevant without the proper conduits of information and communication. The funding for this legislation is not an end in and of itself. Rather it is merely a means to ensure that local educational needs are not ignored due to the inadequacy of local resources. Therefore. it is vital to the success of this program that local schools and communities are enabled to set their own goals. This bill. if enacted. will give not only the responsibility but the financial ability for the participation by school boards. administrators. teachers. parents. bargaining agents. and business. groups in the formulation and evolution of local education initiatives. This act is supported by a wide range of public interest groups. including the National Education Association. the National Parents and Teachers Association. the Council for Language and Other International Studles. the American Federation of Governmental Employees. the American Association for Counseling and Development. the Council of Great City Schools. and the American Association of School Administrators. This act has the bipartisan sponsorship of 235 House Members and 31 Senate Members. It is essential that we respond to the problems of education in the United States with active. not merely rhetorical. measures.e

This administration has also failed to use the limited resource loan program funds provided by Congress. The limited resource loan program was established to serve borrowers who had special credit needslimited resource farmers. beginning farmers and owners and operators of small or family farms with a low income. This program. in the past. has provided young family farmers with an opportunity to buy some land. in addition to providing some young farmers with the means to stay in business. Under this program. qualified borrowers are provided farm operating or farm ownership loans at a reduced rate of interest. At a time when farmers are experiencing a tremendous need for credit due to weak demand and oversupply. the administration is discouraging the use of the limited resource operating loan program. In fiscal year 1982. FmHA did not use $121 million in operating loan funds specifically earmarked for limited resource borrowers. Of this amount. FmHA failed to spend over $7 million that was allocated to my home State of Oklahoma. Yet. in Oklahoma. the average net farm income in 1981 was only $14 per farm. the lowest in the entire Nation. In 1982. that figure will register in the red. Certainly. this would be considered low by anyones standards. yet. the funds were not used. Obviously. the farm economic situation for 1983 will show no improvement from 1982 without a major revision of agricultural policy. Every effort must be made to ease the credit situation for farmers. reduce interest rates. reduce commodity surpluses. improve farm income. and increase agricultural exports. Last night. in the state of the Union address. the President said that he was directing USDA to work with farmers. individually. to help them stay in business during this critical time. The bill we are introducing today will put into law what the President has directed the USDA to do. I hope he will lend his support to the passage of this bill. Specifically. our legislation will require the Secretary to grant deferrals and forgo foreclosures on Farmers Home Administration farm loans when the borrower can show he has followed good management practices. is temporarily unable to make payments due to circumstances beyond his control. and has a reasonable chance of repayment of the loan after the expiration of the deferral period. This provision would be applied. by the Secretary. on an individual. casebycase basis. We have also included a provision which requires the Secretary to establish clear procedures to implement the deferral provision and to notify all borrolvers of these and all otherservicing alternatives available. Some of the FmHA borrowers I have talked with were never informed of the choices they do have. The bill also provides for the extension of the economic emergency direct loan program and requires that the Secretary make these loans nvailable to farmers. Because of the increased costs of production. we have provided for an increase in the operating loan limit. In 1978. the limit was set at $100.000. our legislation would move this up to $200.000. Our legislation also includes an authorization for an additional $200 million in operating loan funds. The current economic condition in agriculture has caused many new borrowers to turn to the ""lenderoflastresort."" the PmHA. The additional $200 million. provided in our bill. should insure that the needs of current FmHA borrowers. as well as new borrowers. can be met. Because of the administrations failure to use the limited resources loan program. our bill requires the FmHA to use the limited resource operating loan program. The use of these funds will allow many of our small farmers and young farmers to remain in farming. During the recess. I had an opportunity to visit with some of the FmHA county supervisors in my State. The expressed to me a need for the authority to allow the rescheduling or reanortising of existing farm loans at the original rate of interest. whichever if lower. They told me that with this authority. they could keep most of their borrowers in business this year. Though the FniHA has the authority to do this for housing loans. they are still unable to use this method for helping their farm borrowers. We have included a provision which will require the FmHA to use this authority for their farm program borrowers as well. Mr. President. the Emergency Agricultural Credit Act of 1983 if both compassionate and prudent. It is compassionate in that it will assist those farmers who are having financial difficulties through no fault of thier own. It is prudent in that it will protect not only the agricultural economy. but it will also protect the health of our Nations total economy from a potential domino effect if agriculture experienced a total collapse. It is imperative that we act now. The future of our entire economy rests upon agriculture. If we do not see recovery in the agricultural sector. we will never experience full economic recovery in the Nation. I urge my colleagues to help us enable our farmers to remain on the farm.e"
980001319,Mr. President. I am today introducing legislation to repeal the 10percent withholding on dividends and interest that was passed last summer as part of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA). The reasons for eliminating this new law are abundantly clear. First. and foremost. the imposition of a withholding tax on Interest and dividends will act as a disincentive to savings and investment at a time when the Federal Government should be doing everything within its power to encourage savings and investment. In effect. we are sending the American people the wrong signal. We will be driving people away from corporate equities. bonds. and other savings mechanisms. Further. we will be lowering the real rate of return on some investments by denying investors the use of withheld funds. It has been estimated that upwards of $3 billion In savers and investors earnings otherwise attained through reinvestment and compounding will be lost to the private capital market. This is money that could go to finance home mortgages. job creation. or capital formation. This law will also have a serious impact on our financial institutions. They must now design and put into operation withholding systems to deal with the vast array of investment and financial services they provide the public. I am not merely speaking of the cost of developing a computer program to actually compute the withholding. One must also take into consideration the time and effort involved in training employees to effectively deal with customer questions involving the new withholding system. not to mention the need to communicate with all customers how the new system will affect them. Citibank has estimated that the administrative costs of withholding for the private sector would be at least $1.5 billion per year and probably more. Further. these costs. of necessity would be passed on to depositors and investors in the form of lower interest payments. reduced dividends. extra service charges. and so forth. One also cannot ignore the devastating impact withholding will have on the elderly and lower income families. The Treasury Department has attempted to get around this problem by proposing regulations that exempt older Americans and others who expect to have little tax liability. Yet. the fact of the matter is that by placing the burden on the individual to exempt himself from withholding. the tax brings many elderly people into the taxpaying system who have been out of it for years. Every time he opens up a savings account. buys a piece of stock. or puts money into a money market fund. he would be required to get and complete an additional form. Thus. this tax would not only put an impossible recordkeeping burden on financial Institutions. but also on the average citizen. It is for this reason the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) worked to try to defeat this provision last summer. Finally. perhaps one of the most convincing arguments against the withholding Involves the supposed revenue gains from Implementing the program. According to the Treasury Department. approximately threequarters of the first years revenue gain comes from nothing more than acceleration of payments. In the original projections this amounted to fully $3 billion of the projected $4.3 billion in revenue gains. It would appear that the administrative costs required to implement the program would far outweigh the real revenue gain of $1.3 billion. In conclusion. Mr. President. I would urge my distinguished colleagues to support the repeal of this unwise law. In an attempt to get at the small percentage of taxpayers who fail to report their interest and dividend income. Congress has enacted legislation which would penalize the nearly 90 percent of American taxpayers who have honestly paid their taxes all along. It seems abundantly clear that the enactment of the 10percent withholding provision was a serious mistake.
980021640,"Mr. President. this is a very simple and straightforward amendment. It really is an issue of philosophy more than anything else because it is revenue neutral. In other words. the provision does not change at all the amount of money that is being raised in terms of benefits and additional revenues for the social security system. It simply eliminates the marriage penalty imposed by the thresholds for the taxation of social security benefits. H.R. 1900 sets the threshold for taxation of social security benefits at $25.000 for individuals and at $32.000 for couples. In other words. we will begin to tax onehalf of the social security benefit after an individual has income of $25.000 or more and after a couple has income of $32.000 or more. This approach imposes a very significant penalty upon married couples. It is clear that if you had two single individuals living in the same household. they would be able to jointly have $50.000 of income before any of their social security benefits would become taxable. But in the case of a married couple. they would only be allowed. under the present package. to have $32.000 of income. So we are dealing with a very significant marriage penalty. To alleviate this problem. the amendment which I have offered proposes to set these thresholds at $20.000 for individuals and $36.000 for joint filers. for married couples. This change. as 1 have said. will generate the same amount of revenue as would the thresholds in H.R. 1900. and the amendment is thus revenue neutral. But. more importantly. however. eliminating the marriage penalty will remove the dislraentive for marriage among recipients of taxable social security benefits. Mr. President. I realize that this amendment is not totally without some controversy. It would mean lowering the threshold for individuals if we are going to keep it revenue neutral. and I believe that is the only responsible way to do it so that we do not upset revenue figures of this package. We have set the figure at $20.000 for individuals. With the changes that have been adopted by the committee to avoid the notch problem. it is possible that there would be some very slight amount of taxation at levels slightly below the $20.000 under the sliding scale which has been adopted. I simply think that we should not have another area of law where we again write in a marriage penalty. We worked for many years now to try to remove the marriage penalty as much as possible from the income tax law. In fact. this suggestion came to me in a series of public meetings which I held in my own State shortly after the first of the year. They were the best attended meetings that I have ever held. I held them in all geographical areas of the State. Many hundreds of people attended each meeting. representing a crosssection of those communities. And at every single meeting that I held. when I asked the audience for suggestions that they themselves might offer. suggestions from the citizens in terms of trying to improve this package. in every single meeting someone raised the issue of the marriage penalty. They said. ""We do not think it is fair for a married couple to only have $32.000 of income exempt and for two single people to have $50.000. In every one of these meetings I took an informal poll of the audience in regard to this suggestion and in every case there wrs a unanimous support for changing the figures so that we could do away with the marriage penalty. There are other advantages that couples have in sharing a single household that individuals do not have. so we have not made it exact. The $20.000 figure and the $36.000 figure were selected to approach. at least approach. neutrality as far as any potential marriage penalty is concerned. It is not exact. Those figures were selected because we wanted. as much as possible. to avoid going below the $20.000 figure as a threshold for the taxation of benefits. and also those figures were chosen so that we could be sure that we wrote this amendment in a form that would make it revenue neutral. it would not impose an additional revenue burden on the taxes which have already been worked out. I think that pretty well explains it. Mr. President. There is certainly room for a difference of opinion on this point. But philosophically. I simply think it is important that we not go into another area of law and begin by having the marriage penalty as a part of it. I think this is a matter appropriately that the Senate should at least consider and make its own judgment upon. I believe I have adequately explained the provision. There should not be any necessity. at least on my part. for a prolonged debate on this matter."
980139992,Mr. President. recently. a tragic and unfortunate event took platce in my State involving a heinous crime. An employee at a small bank in Oklahoma was abducted from his home and held for a ransom. The young mans family did everything they could to comply with the abductors demands. Unfortunately. something went awry. and the employee November 1I. 1983 was murdered. Sonie evidence has suggested that the victim had already been murdered when the extortion attempt took place. Oklahomans were shocked and saddened at this terrible crime. Soon afterwards. a suspect was arrested and charged with these crimes. both extortion and miurder. The suspect is awaiting trail onl these charges now. Mr. President. at this point. the proceedings take on a burden that is both unnecessary and time consuming. Even though the two charges. murder and extortion. were part of the same crime and took place as one continuous action with no intervening breaks. one indictment. extortion. wvill be tried in thle U.S. District Court in Oklahiomia. and the other indictment. murder. must be tried iii the Oklahoma State District Court. This obvious duplication of efforts and evidence as well as subjecting the relatives and witnesses to the trauma and publicity of two trials is an unfortunate situation. Thle legislation 1 am introducing today Would provide a limited remredy for this duplication of efforts and would provide for a consolidated trial in the Federal court of the charges arising from an extortion or extortion attempt. Although it is too late to help in the case I have described above. this remedy of a consolidated proceedinig in the Federal courts is a desirable solution to this problem. Mr. President. it is not my intention to argue about this jurisdictional conflict. between State and Federal law. My only intent. is to allow a consolidation of thle proceedings so that the charges arising from an extortion attempt can be tried in the Federal courts instead of splitting the proceedings anid having to conduct two trials. These dlual proceedings are unfortunate and should not be allowed to cont inue. When. as in this case.. there Is an overriding public interest in providing Federal jurisdiction over the proceedings. there is ample precedent for conferring such jurisdiction In thle Federal courts. Bank robbery. kidnaping. and airline higiackings are but three examples. Mr. President. safety for ourselves and our loved ones is a basic need for every human being. When a wrong is committed. every person touched by that wrong cries out for justice. determined as expeditiously as possible. This bill is designed to do just that. In the limited circumstance where murder or other physical harm occurs during an extortion or extortion attempt. there would be a consolidation df the charges under thle Jurisdiction of the Federal court. The overriding public interest demands that this consolidation in this limited sense be allowed. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD at this point.
980143645,Mr. President. I want to associate myself with the remarks which have been made by my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma. by the Senator from New Mexico. the ranking minority Member. the Senator from Louisiana. and the distinguished chairman of the Energy Commit tee. As one who is riot a member of the Energy Committee. I appreciate immensely the opportunity to work with those who have struggled with this issue for many months already In that coimmitte. I can only say that I think It is a sign that we came relatively close to reaching an agreement. and our efforts continued until Just about 30 minutes ago as we were meeting off the Senate floor. In the last 3 or 4 days. I would say conservatively that 15 or 20 hours have been spent In facetoface meetings between this very broad group of Senators representing a total crosssection of the points of view on pending natural gas legislation. I think it is a tribute to the chairman. to his skill at bringing people together and bringing them together In a goodfaith situation. that these negotiations came so close to success. The Senate has spoken. in many ways. on the two polar positions on the Issues and by a large majority has reje~cted the concept of decontrol. At the same time it has rejected a bill which. from my point of view. cannot be accepted because it contained in it provisions for contract abrogation. I think between those two polar positions we started to work toward fashioning a compromise package. We have gone a long way. I. too. want to pledge to the chairman my support of his continuing efforts after we return in January to press ahead from where we are. The hours that we have spent in the last few days In negotiating are not wasted hours by any means. They represent a great step forward. and when we resume our negotiations in January. we resume them in a position much closer to agreement. many steps ahead of where we first started. So I think that while we all share disappointement that we are not now getting ready to vote on a package that has reached a total agreement. we can say that we have come a long way. That means that It Is a shorter distance to that ultimate goal than when we started. and that cannot. be wasted time and effort. I thank the chairman and I thank all of those who have joined with us in good faith in these negotiations.
980144922,"Mr. President. this Congress. like the last one. will unfortunately be remembered more for what it left undone rather than for any meager accomplishments it may have had. While our institutional shortcomings are still fresh in our minds. we should start to move toward assuring that we will do something to make needed changes. On this final day of the 1st session of the 98th Congress I am Introducing the ""Joint Select Committee on Congressional Operations Act."" The measure will establish a joint committee of the Congress to study ways to reform the Institution. It Is my Intent that such a committee. with 10 Members from the House and a like number from the Senate. should look at all aspects of congressional operations. from the rules uinder which the two Houses legislate. to the budget process. the proliferation of committees and staff. The comnmittee would exist for only a limited period under a tunset provision so it does not itself become part of the problem. As an institution. Congress is in trouble. The signs Ere all too clear. Congress is slow to respond with solutions to many of our basic problems. It has failed to write sensible Federal budgets. The manner in which Members of Congress are elected and are compensated threatens to further distort the political system. At the end of the useless ""lameduck"" session last year. I found myself angry and frustrated. I was also embarrassed that Congress had made a ridiculous spectacle of Itself in the eyes of the public. I grew up watching Congress. My father whs a Congressman. My earliest memories are of listening to Sam Rayburn discuss the Institution during visits to our home. I wanted someday to serve in Congress because I felt that it was a place where a person could make a meaningful contribution to his country. It hurt when I heard so manny of my most -able arnd dedicated colleagues talk about quitting sooner than they had planned. It was even worse when I began to ask myself whether Congress was really the place where I or anyone else could really get things done. At the same time. I was encouraged. For once the press seemed to b~e focusing on the need for congressional reform. Editorials and columns were written on the subject. It even made frontpage headlines. Then suddenly. as often happens in Washington. our attention was diverted elsewhere. There were no more headlines. columns or editlorlals about the need for congressional reform. But the problem did not go awayit just dropped from sight. Congress has not streamlined or reformed its rules and procedures for almost 40 years. It is creaking along with work methods that are not suited to the times. It resembles a telephone switchboard designed for 10 telephones that now has 10.000 plugged Into It. The failure of the session again this year to deal in any meaningful way with the looming budget crisis. the need for a coherent energy policy. a new strategy to Improve our ability to compete In the International economy and many other pressing needs of the Nation. makes it clear that the problems are as bad if not worse than they were In 1982. In the last Congress. 80 days of precious time were consumed by filibusters on 12 different bills. nearly all of which became law In spite of the prolonged debate. Even when an overwhelming majority of Senators decides to shut off a filibuster. uinder Senate rules a vote on the bill can still be delayed for at least 100 more hours of the Senates time In session. With such rules. just the threat of a filibuster by one or two Senators can prevent an issue from being scheduled for consideration on the Senate floor. Filibusters supported by 40 or more Members of the Senate may occasionally be Justified on matters of extreme national importance. Howvever. once a filibuster is ended by a vote of 60 Members of the Senate and those who have sutiported it have already had a full chance to debate. one or two Senators should not be able to bring the entire Government to a halt. As American politics becomes more fragmented and dominated by oneissue groups. the use of the filibuster has become more common. From 1917 to 1972 there were 60 filibusters. In Just the last 10 years there have been Trhe increasing abuse of the filibuster procedure is not the only problem. According to a recent study conducted by Senator DAVID PRYOR. In the first 6 mnonths of last year almost onethird of the time of tile Senate was taken up by recesses. quorum calls and other procedural timekilling devices. Congress also tends to vote during only 3 days each week and to remain in session almost all year long. It would be far better to have 5 or more full days each week and stay In session only 6 nmonthls each year so that Members could stay in their home State for prolonged periods. On another front. fragmented and overlapping Jurisdiction of committees often slows Congress to a snails pace as a proposed law has to be considered by so many different committees. The number of subcommittees has mushroomed to 250 and their staffs have growvn from 400 to 2.000 in the last three decades. In addition. socalled nongermane amendments. which have nothing to do with the subject matter of a bill. can be tacked onto it. For example. foreign policy amendments can be attached to agricultural bills. and vice versa. Another problem Is that the same controversial provisions and issues can come uip again and again within the same year for repeat votes. thus wasting time. There should be a rule that. once a matter has been brought to a vote. it cannot be brought up again during the same session. The present budget process Is alba obvico!sly not working. Under It. Congress spends most of Its timne passing resolutions instructing itself about how to write a budget rather than passing the actual appropriations bills. In 3 of the last 6 years. Congress has failed to pass any complete budget. Nor has the process worked to restrain deficit spending. On the contrary. during the 9 years since the Budget Act was adopted. more than three timles as much has been added to the Ilational1 debt as was added in the previous 30 years. The citizens anid taxpayers have a righlt to expect a m~ore efficient and businesslike approach fromt Congress. Both Republican Senate leader HOWARD BAKER and Democratic leader ROBERT BYRD have nmoved constructively in nainilg an ad hloc task force to recommuend reforms. The group is in the process of making reconmmendations on limliting tile postclosure filibuster and in reducing the use of nongermane amenldments. Tile recent FearsonRibicoff study also contains several recommendations worthy of consideration. However. piecemeal efforts are not enough. Congress should create a joint HouseSenate committee to focus solely on the issue of congressional reform. It should have a time limit so that it does not turn into another permanent committee. Of course. internal reform of Congress will not solve all of the Nations problems. To a large degree. the fragmentation and stalemates in Congress reflect the division and fragmentation of the American people. While reforming Congress may not be the sole answer. it is still absolutely necessary If we are to maintain the integrity of the democratic process. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the RECORD following my remarks."
980170131,"Mr. President. I am very pleased to join in the remarks that have been made earlier by the Senator from California and the Senator from Delaware. who both participated as I did as members of the observer team for the elections in El Salvador this past weekend. I am not a member of the (Commit.tee on Foreign Relations and this was ny first visit to El Salvador. I hope that I have restat. ed the temptation that confronts many of us on many occasions to become instant experts. but I would like to share with my colleagues some of the impressions that I received while I was there. and in so doing. to lend my very strong and firm support for the amendment offered by the Senator from Hawaii. a very reasonable compromise that he has presented to us which will enable as to provide the aid necessary to allow the democratic process to go forward in El Salvador. After we arrived in that country on the morning of the elections. Senators WILSON and Congressman CHENEY from Wyoming. and I were helicoptered to the town of Berlin. a community of some 6.000. about 60 or 70 miles from the capital. It Is in an area that has seen much guerrilla activity. It was a community that a few months ago was under occupation by the guerrillas for 3 days and was much written and spoken about in the media at that time. While we were in that community observing the voting. the guerrillas took control of another community some 10 kilometers away. stopped the election. destroyed the election materials. and prevented the people in that community from voting. So we were in an area where the people coming to vote knew they faced potential threat to their own safety by guerrilla activity. After we left Berlin. we were in San Miguel. where 25 minutes after we left the airport there. the little landing field where our helicopter touched down. an artillery fire fight broke out. and in the community of San Miguel. a city of over 100.000. during the entire night following the election. the citizens were besieged by an attack by the guerrillas. When we arrived there. they had been without water and electricity for 3 days. These were people who were called upon to go to the polls under conditions that certainly tested their courage and their commitment to the democratic process. I wish that every single American citizen could have had the opportunity to witness what we witnessed. I will never again take for granted the privilege of voting in an election. I will never again go to the polls with the same feeling. The right to vote. the privilege of voting. has taken on new meaning for me because of what I saw in El Salvador. To say that it had an emotional impact on me is an understatement. When we arrived at the little town of Berlin. not only were the 6.000 inhabitants out in the streets. there were also some 10.000 people from the countryside qualified to come to vote in that town. There were five voting places set up around the little town square. As we flew over. I was amazed to look down and see a crowd of some 15.000 people at 8 oclock in the morning already gathered together in that square waiting to exercise their right to vote. When we landed and went into the midst of that crowd. we saw people who were dressed up in their Sunday best. I remember one elderly lady with whom I spoke who did not have enough money to wear shoes as part of her Sunday best wardrobe. She was there barefooted. In her own modest way. she had done her best to put on her best clothes. to look as good as she could. She had walked. she told me. some 6 miles into town to vote. She had walked through areas that had been infested from time to time with guerrilla activity. I am sure she could in no way guarantee that she was going to arrive safely on foot to cast her vote. I said to her. ""Why did you decide to make this effort. to take this risk to come to vote?"" And she stood thereI do not understand Spanish. only a few words. but I understand expressions on peoples faces. I understand attitudes that are being expressed by the way people stand and the way they look. She stood up as straight as she could with obvious pride and she said to me. ""Because it is my right to vote. because I am a citizen. because we have elections here now."" I will never forget the pride that she felt. the dignity she felt that perhaps for the first time because elections had not been able to be held in some of those areas in 1982 because of guerrilla activity. the pride she felt at being able to exercise that right of voting. It was a festive atmosphere. People were smiling. people were excited. Many of the representatives of the political parties had on Tshirts with their party logo. There was an intense feeling about allegiance to the various parties represented. Mr. President. when our observer team had a press conference in El Salvador before we left. we were asked by some of the international journalists. and even some of our own. some questions that shocked me. One person said to me. ""Senator what did you think about the fact that all these people were coerced into going to vote?"" They were referring to a law on the books that said that it was a citizens duty to vote. even though no one has ever been fined. that anybody can find out about. for not doing so. They have laws like that in Australia and a lot of other countries. It is felt to be a citizens obligation to vote. There is not one person. a Member of the U.S. Senate or a journalist who covers the political activity on Capitol Hill. people who are observers of human nature. who can read human beingsthere is not one person I know of. unless it is what they wanted to see. who could have seen any kind of constraint or force or intimidation In terms of making people go out to vote. These were people who were smiling. These were people who were dressed up. These were people who were mingling happily together In a crowd. They wanted to vote. Not only were they not coerced. they had taken great risks to vote. When they went up to the voting table. they stood before three election officials. each from a different political party. I do not think any observer in the world would say that dAubuisson or others were in collusion with each other or the other parties represented. There is a real difference in those parties. There is real competition between them. Here you had three people from three different parties as the person came up to get a ballot to vote. Behind those three were eight other observers from all political parties. I have never seen an election In which there was so much watching of each other by the political parties as I saw there. I say to the senior Senator from Mississippi that I have seen election watchers in Oklahoma. and I am sure they are in Mississippi. but I have never seen people watching each other as they did in El Salvador. They have a voting card with their photograph on it. When a person came up to vote. the election officials and the watchers looked at the photograph to see that it was the same person who had the card. When they voted. the card was stamped. Then the person put his or her finger in a solution of silver nitrate that caused the finger to turn black. and it could not be washed off for 3 or 4 days. This was done so that they could not vote twice. They not only looked at the photograph but also at the persons hands. to make sure they had not voted once already. If ever a system was designed to prevent fraudand successfullyit was that system. It was so complicated that the computer lists slowed down the pace of voting and in some cases caused some confusion. I am absolutely convinced of the basic honesty and fairness of that election. I may not be an expert in foreign policy. but I do understand when I see a fair election process going on. and I also understand looks that I see on peoples faces. I also understand an atmosphere that exists. We plunged into a crowd of literally several thousand and asked them at random. with the interpreters we had. why they were voting. Senator WILsoN just handed me a note stating that I iad an excellent interpreter. Senator WILsoN does speak some Spanish and sometimes served as my interpreter. and he did a fine job of that. We plunged into the middle of a crowd. ""Why did you vote?"" I asked one woman late in the afternoon. She had been there 7 hours. in the hot sun. She said. ""For El Salvador. for my country. for what is best for all of us."" Others answered. ""Because we hope we will get a better government and we will be able to get Jobs."" Others said. ""Because we want peace."" They all knew why they were there. They believed in the process. and they turned out. Think about it. We would celebrate. we would bring out the brass bands. if we got a 70percent election turnout in this country. in a Presidential election. They had a 70 percent turnout in the midst of a war. Mr. President. I will never forget it. I. will never forget what I felt in the town square of Berlin where 15.000 people desired to vote. I do not believe there Is 1 American in 1.000 who could feel that it would be moral or right for us to turn our backs on people in our own backyard. in our own hemisphere. who were exercising that kind of commitment and courage. and say to them: ""Im sorry. If your soldiers run out of ammunition to protect you when you are going to the polls next time""-and in over 40 towns they could not vote this time because the guerrillas took them over. If the army had not been there protecting them. they could not have voted in most of the country. To say ""If your ammunition runs out. if the fuel for your helicopters runs out. if you do not have medical supplies""-and medical supplies are in such short supply that 50 percent of all those injured are dying. Imagine that. That is the kind of figure for which we have to go back to our own Civil War times. to have a mortality rate that high in terms of injury. They do not have ambulances. They do not have helicopters. They do not have supplies to take care of them. How can we say to these people. having urged them to stand up for democracy and for free elections. having worked on them to apply pressure on their military to agree to abide by the democratic processhow can we say: It Is not our concern in the United States if you do not have the sufficient ability to carry on and hold that runoff election a month from now. it is not our concern that you are not able to keep enough order to inaugurate your next president. How can we turn our backs on those people? In my nind. It would be nothing short of crirminal. a criminal act of negligence. a ""timinal break of faith with people who desire democracy. who want the bullet. not the ballot. to determine t ieir destiny. It would be a criminal act of negligence toward the interests of the United States of America. because we have a vital interest in preserving stability in Central America. We do not want to have to fight on the Rio Grande the battle for stability in our hemisphere. Here. we have one that we have a chance to win. A moderate. Mr. Duarte. led in the polls. There is every indication that others of the parties that were running will ally themselves with Mr. Duarte in the runoff. The relationship between the military and the civilian process has changed dramatically. We heard from General Casanova. the Defense Minister of the country. when we were there. He committed himself in the strongest terms that. if he had anything to say about it. if he is able to remain as Defense Minister. the military will accept the results of the election. no matter what the results are. The military voluntarily decided not to vote in this election because they wanted to demonstrate that they were going to accept whatever results came out and because they vanted to levote themselves to the people who were voting. The general has done an excel lent job of getting that down to the grass roots. One thing I watched most carefully was the relationship between the soldiers stationed at the voting places and the voters. It was not a relationship of fear or intimidation. There was joking and smiling and laughing. obviously a good relationship. We stopped to talk to some of those soldiers indIvidually. Some looked 16 or younger. We asked them. ""Why did you not vote today?"" They said. ""Because we soldiew want to demonstrate that we are for democracy. for whoever wins. We are for democracy. We are for elections. and we have to do our job today in protecting the voting places."" So not only did we hear the speech from the Defense Minister. we found time and time again that that value. that belief had been transmitted right down to that young soldier who was there guarding the voting places. Mr. President. I know that the election itself will not solve all the problems. There is still a lot to be done. It does not automatically take the guerrillas out of the field. Maybe 3 or 5 percent of the population of the country support them. We met with the Catholic Archbishop of El Salvador. He told us he thought that the guerrillas had very. very little public support. as he put it. but they still obviously have an ability through military force to cause severe disruptions. The electricity was off most of the time we were there. In many of the cities it was off most of the time. So they still have the ability to disrupt and there will have to be some way found to bring about peace. There will have to be some way found to broaden the political base for any new government. New judicial reform is going to have to be achieved so we can do what Senator KENNEDY wants us to do which certainly Is the desire I share that those who are responsible for the murder of the nuns and labor leaders be brought to trial and brought to Justice. We all want to see that. But that is going to take some time. We are optimistic. I heard various statements given that we hope that those who are accused of murdering the four American nuns will be brought to trail within perhaps the next 60 days. I think that Is very possible we will see that happen. But I think it is imperative and I think it is a moral obligation of this country to at least support the $61.7 million that Senator INouYE has developed in his amendment. To do less I think would be to undercut any opportunities we have there for victory. for victory not only of American interests but more importantly for the very democratic principles that we espouse for selfdetermination of those people for themselves. Why? If we do not give them quite enough. and if we have to err on one side or the other. let us err on the side of giving them a little more ammunition. ambulances. and fuel that they need. rather than a little bit too little. If we give them too little. here is what can happen. They will begin to say: Well. our ammunition might be running out. or fuel might run out. so we better hoard it back. We better keep it back because we may not have enough to see us through. Particularly if the guerrillas step up their level of activity. This would be disastrous. It would cause more government outposts to fall in the hands of the rebels. the guerrillas. It would cause more of the weapons we supply them to fall into the wrong hands. It would be a serious and tragic mistake for our country. I think it is also a mistake and I say this with due respect to the Senator from MassachusettA. because I think it has been helpful for us to impose human rights conditions on the aid which we have given in the past. I think more progress has been achieved because we have continued to exert leverage against the government there. President Magana. and others. who I think are people of good will who want to see the human rights violations stopped. I think they are strengthening themselves because they can say: We have to proceed a little faster because the U.S. congress. the American people are watching us. They are conditioning their aid to us on that basis. So I support reasonable conditions. But I am concerned about setting a date. a May date. For example. let us suppose that the election goes as I personally hope. and it would not be right or possible for me to speak for our Government. but let us support that Mr. Duarte wins so we have a moderate government in power. Let us suppose that the military accepts that result. It is still going to take that new government time. The bestintentioned person in the world is still going to be dealing with terribly difficult problems. That country has had negative growth in its gross national product for the last 3 years. They have terrible economic problems. Getting the political factions. even all the political factions to agree and support democracy. getting them all togther on one kind of reform you make in the court system or how you change things is difficult. The fact that they brought about the party working together. brought about such a complex election process. indicates even these people of good will find it very difficult from a technical point of view to get together to form a consensus. That should not amaze any of us in the U.S. Senate. as fragmented as we often are among ourselves trying to hammer out a consensus on the budget of the United States or on other issues. It is even more difficult in a country that lacks the traditions and background that we have in this country. So I say. Mr. President. I hope my colleagues will think long and hard about this matter. We. of course. will have the right after the election to reevaluate our policy. to base our policy at that time on whatever the decisions of the new government are in terms of accepting human rights as a value to which they commit themselves. reform of the judicial system and others. We can always revise our policy. But as of now. I think nothing Is more important to those people that I saw standing in that square and the political leadership that they are trying to freely elect that we send them a message: We are behind yu. You have had the courage to go vote. You had the courage to stand up before the electoral process. We are not going to cut the string so short that you feel insecure about our support for you. We are not going to hold you on a leash so short that you are afraid to expend your met ical supplies or your ammunition to support the electoral process. The only regret about my trip this past weekend to El Salvador is that only six of us from the U.S. Senate had the opportunity to observe that election firsthand. I wish that the other 94 could have been with us. could have seen it. and I cannot believe that any person who saw that inspiring experience with his own eyes would come back with any other attitude than that we want to support those people. that we will not turn our backs on them. that we realize that the election process is only a part of the longterm solution. but we know it is a necessary part. We know much more is going to happen after that. But we want to send them a loud and clear message that until that election process is completed they do not have to look behind them and wonder where the people and the Government of the United States stand. They know with certainty that we stand behind them. that we are proud of them. that as human beings who value our own political freedom and rights in this country we will never turn our backs on them. Mr. President. if we are going to take a stand anywhere in Central America at any time. when you have 70 percent of a people under conditions of war brave enough to go and vote in a democratic free election. that is the place to take the stand and now is the time to take it. and it is time for all of us not by a 1vote majority or a 10vote majority but by an overwhelming majority endorse the aspirations of those people by passing overwhelmingly the amendment of the Senator from Hawaii."
980171553,Mr. President. the amendment at the desk is on behalf of myself and Senator MOYNIHAN. In 1981 the Finance Committee unanimously approved the Work Incentive Demonstration Act and attached it to that years reconciliation bill. The work incentive (WIN) demon stration project allows participatine States to consolidate administration of the WIN program in the State welfare aRency. In contrast. the regular WIN program divides administrative respor mEek J0. 19084 Mark 84 1984 sibility between the St.ate welfare agency and the State emploanent security commission. The purpose of both the WIN program and the WIN demonstration program Ia to place wel* fare recipients in unsubsidised privatesector jobs. Some 18 States have participated in the WIN demonstration program. taking advantage of the administrative efficiency which It provides. The resuits have often been outstanding. as ia illustrated by the example of Oklahoma. During the 18month period which ended July 1. 1988. precisely 4.560 AFDC clients had been placed in longerterm. unsubaldized privatesector employment as part of the WIN demonstration project in that State. Thin ia more than double the number so placed when the regular WIN pro. gram was still in effect in Oklahoma (and elsewhere) in fiscal year 1981. Authority for additional States to participate in the program expires on June 30. 1984. Those States already participating in the WIN demonstration program are confined by a 3year limit upon the duration of the program. In many States this 8year period will end in 1985. The amendment would do the following: Repeal the June 30. 1984. deadline for additional States to apply to participate in the demonstratkon program. repeal the 3year limit uponthe duration of the program. authorfe a study of the funding formula. Extension of the WIN demonstration program involves no cost. The Federal allocation to States continues at the same level regardless of whether that State has chosen to participate in the WIN demo or to remain in the regular WIN program. I am convinced that extending the WIN demo will result in net Pederal savings. Many participating States (such as Oklahoma) have found that the WIN demo project enables them to remove a far greater number of AFDC reipients from the welfare rolls and place them in private employment than were placed when the regular WIN program was in effect in those States. The resulting savings in AFDC payments could prove to be quite significant. The following States are now participating:
980244649,"Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to pass S. 2820. It will name the Federal building in McAlester. OK. in honor of Carl Albert. Mr. Albert served in the U.S. Congress for 30 years and attained the highest position in Government ever held by an Oklahoman. He not only served as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives for 6 years. but twice was just a heartbeat away from the Presidencyfirst when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and again. when Vice President Gerald. Ford succeeded Richard Nixon. He is the only living former Speaker. Before becoming Speaker. Mr. Albert had served as majority whip and then as majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives. He attended Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. Of Mr. Albert. present Speaker THoxAs P. ""Tip"" ONELL. who succeeded him in that position. said in a speech in Oklahoma City in May. 1981: ""Carls leadership abilities were evident during one of the worst constitutional crises this country has ever had."" He added that Speaker Alberts ""trust. composure. intellect and impartialit)."" had contributed to the countrys solidity during the resignation of former President Nixon. Former President Gerald Ford. speaking at that same meeting in Oklahoma City. said Mr. Albert was ""always seeking to do what was In the best interest of our country."" Carl Alberts hometown of McAlester has always been very dear to him. When he retired from Congress in January. 1977. he returned to Bug Tussle. the community near McAlester where he had spent his boyhood. He has continued to be active in church and civic activities in McAlester since his retirement and still has an office in the Federal building. Through the years he spent in Congress. he officed in that building. It is entirely fitting that the name of that building should honor him. The Parkway. a principal street in McAlester in front of the building. is already named for Mr. Albert. I have known and admired Speaker Albert all of my adult life. One of the things that I most admire about him is that in spite of the. high positions which he has occupied. he has never lost his identity with the average man and woman and his sensitivity to their needs and hopes. He is as much at home today in McAlester. OK. with the people he loves as he was on the day he left to first come to Congress. I again urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this well deserved tribute to Carl Albert."

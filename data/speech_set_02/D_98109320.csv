980027959,Mr. Chairman. I. too. rise in strong support of H.R. 1983. One of the key elements of the American dream is owning a home. The threat of mortgage foreclosure shatters that dream. sometimes forever. The effects of this recession and the failure of this administration to properly enforce our trade laws have had a devastating impact on the working people of our Nation. We often hear of towns and cities that have the dubious distinction of having the Nations highest unemployment rate. Let me give you the unemployment percentages in five countries that help make up my congressional district in western Pennsylvania. They are: 20 percent. 23.2 percent. 23.1 percent. 16.4 percent. and 21.6 percent. Mortgage foreclosures have been occurring at record levels all across America. In my district. they have closely paralleled the increase in steel imports. Let me cite just one example. Last year when imports reached record levels. so did mortgage foreclosures. In Beaver County. Pa.. my home county. 99 homes were foreclosed on. Many of those families lost their piece of the American dream because their primary breadwinner was laid off. There is no way a family can make $500 monthly mortgage payments when the workingman is laid off. Worse yet. how do .I explain to a laid off railroad worker that he and his family have to live on $25 a day in unemployment benefits? Once a family is foreclosed on. the family unit itself begins to weaken. There is tremendous stress and a loss of dignity and pride. In addition. there are instances of child and spouse abuse. What is even more unreasonable is the fact that once a family leaves its home. there is generally not another family waiting to purchase it or adsume the mortgage. As an example. a constituent of mine who is a laidoff steelworker. testified before the Banking Committee when public hearings were held on this legislation last February. The gentleman told the committee that even though his house was lost through foreclosure. it was setting vacant. because no one else could afford or was interested in moving In. This to me is a tremendous waste. Even more appalling was the story carried by a Pittsburgh television station as well as the local newspaper. The story told of a family that had lost their home and was forced to live in an automobile. I relate this. not to be sensationalistic. but because I have seen it. This bill will not help those who have already lost their homes. but it will offer hope to those who are on the brink of foreclosure. I acknowledge and even appreciate some of the arguments being offered against this bill. Many contend that it will create further bureaucracy. Others assert that it will not really help people until next year. Mr. Chairman. it would be unfitting of this Congress to callously turn its back on those in this Nation who genuinely need mortgage assistance. It would be wrong to permit the American dream to be snatched away from them. I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 1983.
980103158,Mr. Chairman. I strongly support H.R. 3929. the extension of the Federal supplemental compensation program. Mr. Chairman. this legislation addresses a very real and clear emergency In my district. There are thousands of people throughout my sixcounty area who are completely out of unemployment benefits. These are the longterm unemployed who have not been part of our modest economic recovery. In fact. the entire Fourth Congressional District has had no part in an economic recovery. The human costs associated with longterm unemployment have been pointed out time and time again on the House floor: mortgage foreclosure. divorce. spouse and child abuse. alcoholism. and even suicide. We have a responsibility in this Congress to help alleviate these terrible human costs of longterm unemployment. This extension of the Federal supplemental compensation program is a step in the right direction. In taking this step. let us not forget that these people do not want unemiployment compensation but they need unemployment compensation. What they obviously want is a job. Yet when this House passed a reasonable. responsible. and modest $3.5 billion Jobs bill that would help the longterm unemployed. the Republicanicontrolled Senate refused to act on it and President Reagan emphatically stated lie would veto it. They refuse to give the longterm unemployed any real hope for the future. Even the administrations most optimistic projections foresee unemployment remaining above 8 percent through late 1984. But even given this disastrous level of unemployment. the Reagan administration will not support jobcreating legislation. This fact makes it. even more Important that we pass this Federal supplemental compensation bill in the House and work out the differences with the Senate as soon as possible. These individuals who will be -eligible for the additional weeks provided in this bill have earned them. And they desperately need them. Let us not abandon our responsibility to provide the benefits our unemployed constituents need and to provide them with some hope for the future. even though that hope will be temporary. In the meantime. I urge my colleagues to join me In continuing to call for legislation that will give our unemployed what they really want: Jobs.*
980127569,Mr. Speaker. yesterday I introduced a bill that would give congressional consent to the interstate high speed atercity rail passenger compact that is participated in by the States of Illinois. Indiana. Michigan. Ohio. and Pennsylvania. This Interstate compact was set in motion several years ago but the Constitution requires congressional approval for any such interstate compact. This bill is introduced to do just that. There are many precedents for State compacts. but there is only one other In the field of high speed rail. On June 30. 1983. the 97th Congress passed Public Law 97213 enabling the States of Louisiana and Mississippi to form a rapid rail transit commission. The State of Alabama subsequently joined the compact. I have been an advocate of high speed rail passenger service for years now. While a State representative. I was deeply involved in this Issue and cosponsored the bill that formed the high speed rail commission in Pennsylvania. I have brought my interest in and advocacy of high speed rail passenger service with me to Washington and intend to continue to promote the development of high speed rail in Congress. All of the States in the compact are rail intensive States that would undloubtedly receive numerous benefits from the development of high speed rail. This development can provide a catalyst for economic growth in the rail industry that can spinoff to other related industries. especially steel. This economic growth in the five States In the compact would bring something we all desperately need and wantjobs. Thousands of new jobs would be created to construct and operate a high speed rail passenger service system. The United States is one of the few industrialized countries that does not have sonme type of high speed rail passenger servine. In fact. we are one of the few industrialized countries without an effective and efficient rail systemn of any kind. Only onetenith of 1 percent of all passenger travel In this country is by train. I believe a high speed rail system would provide the inducemients we need:. speed. safety. comfort. and dependability for example. to get more people to travel by rail. I am not trying to make the claim that a high speed rail passenger system will bring complete economic recovery to the five States in this compact. but it certainly is a small step in the right direction.*

980152724,Mr. Speaker. over the past 4 weeks. the stock market has continually gone down. Experts claim that the proposed $200 billion deficit in the PIresidents 1985 Federal budget is responsible for all the pessimism on Wall street. The people of my district are also concerned about this recordbreaking deficit. The current bipart1san discussions between the Congress and tle White House are attempting to address this problem. Something mist be done. I would like the record to show what I have been hearing. at my local town meet ings. been reading in letters from constituents. and what I have bern told by the people of the Fourth Congressional District of Pennsylvania. I nust also say that I agree with what. the people 1 represent are saying. Corusiderable savings could be made by crtting waste out of the Defense budget without hurting our ability to defend the Nation. The President has prIoposed a $35 billion increase in the Defense budget over the 1984 budget to total $272 billion in defense outlays for 1985. Our national defense problems cannot be solved by throwing money at them. Defense procurement ciun be improved. to prevent the w(lliublicized purchases of $100 dollar wrenches. Quest ionable weapons prorans such as the MX missile and the rtpid dploym(ent force can be elimitimked or dlayed. Forvin aid does not make much ..vnsv to the people of my district. twhre uneimiployment is still close to IS pircent. The President is proposing to increase. foreign aid by $4 billion bet wken 19114 and 1985 to bring our total forvim aid budget to $17.5 billion in 19115. Most of this increase is In milltiry kid. and sone of that. goes to onit ries who have little regard for th IIuan rights of their citizens. Simpliticatioln of tle tax system is Smiil hing we all want. The President kven mentioned it in his state of the knion address. In ninny ways. our current Iax system is already simple. as it is indrstood. back hone. Rich people simply (o not pay taxes. Wealthy cortIrkt ions simply to not. pay taxes. The tax burden is placed simply on the backs of working people. I urge the reslponsible parties to simplify our tax systIirn in a way which reflects a basic Itiirness which eliniinates tax loopholes usetd by those who are the wealtliest among us. liilget Director David Stockman told 11 congressional panel that the mountry was like a company in the lth hour before bankruptcy. We cannot borrow to pay for excessive detense and foreign aid spending. We kiinnot borrow to make up for wealthy tax avoiders. We cannot borrow iiainst the future of America.
980158616,Mr. Chairman. today we have the opportunity of supporting legislation that will impact upon millions of people living in rural areas across the United States. The Rural Electrification and Telephone SelfSufficiency Act of 1983. H.R. 3050. seeks to stabilize the Federal financing programs that benefit rural electric cooperatives and help keep members electric bills as reasonable as possible. Over the past several days I have received a considerable amount of information that outlines the arguments for and against this legislation. Mr. Speaker. with your permission. I would like to share information that should prove most enlightening to my colleagues. While investorowned utilities average over 35 customers per mile of line. rural electric coops service slightly under 5 customers per mile. In terms of revenue per linemile. these statistics translate into about $42.000 for investorowned utilities and only about $3.370 for rural electric coops. Viewing the situation from an investment perspective provides an even more telling picture. Rural electric coops invest an average of $1.337 on distribution per consumer. In contrast. investorowned companies spend about $825 on distribution investment per consumer. In addition. coops do not normally enjoy the luxury of serving industrial consumers and large. populated urban and suburban areas. Often coop lines must be strung for miles just to provide service to a handful of customers. It is interesting to note that the accelerated cost recovery system provision of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA). and provisions of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) have provided substantial benefits to investorand municipalowned utilities. Investorowned utilities enjoy what amounts to $40 per customer in terms of Federal aid. while coops receive. about $9 per member. Insuring the financial viability of the Rural Electrification Administration loan program will not only assist coops in dealing with the disadvantages mentioned above. but it will help coops bring power and data transmission services in rural America up to more modern standards. In many areas the original poles and wire still serves coop customers. When the time for replacement arrives. coops will be in a position to finance expensive new equipment. This will help maintain service of the highest degree possible. In closing. I would like to share some comments on rural electric coops from a constituent of mine. Donald Streams is a dairy farmer in Blairsville. Pa.. with a herd of about 110 cows. He and just one farmhand can milk the entire herd because of electric milking devices. They have also increased their yield and the quality of their products because of access to affordable power. Clearly. electricity has enabled the American farmer to improve the quality and quantity of food. Don added that he wouldnt want to think what it would be like without rural electric coops. If meaningful and responsible action is not taken. the goal of maintaining universal service for rural America will be in serious jeopardy.*
980167637,Mr. Chairman. this bill presents the House with an opportunity for restoring discipline to .his Nations Bankruptcy Code. Since the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. there has been a noticeable increase in the number of Individuals who filed for personal bankruptcy under chapter 7. In fact. the number of personal bankruptcies in the last 5 years as reported by the administrative office of the Federal court system have risen from over 179.000 in 1978 to over 450.000 in 1982. Undoubtedly. poor economic conditions were a factor. but I would contend that the option of choosing between chapters 7 and 13 also played a significant role. It has been estimated that debts unnecessarily forgiven under chapter 7 proceedings cost lenders about $1 billion every year. Lending institutions in turn. pass that huge sum on to other consumers through higher prices and restricted credit availability. The skyrocketing number of personal bankruptcies indicates that we must reexamine our policy. I want to make it clear that provisions of this bill do not preclude an individual from filing for chapter 7. The bill does. however. permit the courts to determine the best means of appropriately resolving a bankruptcy case. By including this provision in H.R. 5174. Congress is taking a positive step in restoring discipline to a component of the bankruptcy system that has been out of balance for several years. Perhaps of even greater concern is the recent misuse of the bankruptcy laws to unilaterally abrogate collective bargaining agreements. Such abuse threatens to destabilize the entire labor relations system that has been created over the last 60 years. The recent Supreme Court decision in NLRB against Bildisco & Bildisco. February 22. 1984. and the effect this decision will have on industrial relations presents the issue in starker terms than ever: the Court ruled that a company may abrogate its collective bargaining agreement even if the labor costs associated with that agreement do not directly threaten the financial health of the company. Two rulings were made in the Supreme Courts decision of NLRB against Bildisco. First. a unanimous Court declared that a bankruptcy judge may permit an employer in chapter 11 proceedings to reject its collective bargaining agreement upon showing that it is burdensome and that the overall interests of all concerned parties favor rejection. Before a bankruptcy court may approve rejection. however. it must be satisfied that the employer has made a reasonable attempt to obtain the unions voluntary agreement to labor cost reduction. Second. a 5 to 4 majority ruled that it is not an unfair labor practice for an employer in bankruptcy to make unilateral changes in a labor contract even before receiving the bankruptcy courts permission to reject. This decision creates a fundamental inequity in relations between labor and management which has the potential to create turmoil in our economy. Our Nations labor laws are written in order to create stability. neither labor. nor management is permitted to repudiate a collective bargaining agreement in midcontract. It is illegal for labor unions to strike in midcontact even if. for instance. inflation has wildly exceeded their expectations and has severely cut into their collectively bargained wages. It must also be illegal for management to abrogate labor agreements in midcontract unless the contract itself would force the company to go out of business. By applying different standards to companies than are applied to their workers. the Bildisco decision has established an environment of instability that poses a threat not only to every labor agreement in this country. but to our commerical well being. The legislation before us today would establish a reasonable standard for bankruptcy judges in deciding whether or not to approve an employers request to have a labor contract rejected. This bill would return to the standard established by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks v. REA Express. Inc. 523 F. 2D 164. 167169. (CA2). Cert. Denied. 423. U.S. 1017 (1975). In that standard the collective bargaining agreement would otherwise be lost and any financial reorganization would fail. As a result of the Supreme Courts Marathon Pipeline decision. no judges have been appointed to fill the void left when the term expires on April 1. It is on April Fools Day that we will be faced with the virtual collapse of our entire Federal bankruptcy system. In place of a joke will be harsh reality. perhaps the most cruel joke ever perpetrated on American society. The Marathon decision has. without question. radically impaired the jurisdiction Congress intended the judicial system to have in these urgent mat ters. Without the article 3 bankruptcy court. any proposed system will constantly be subjected to constitutional challenges. At this time. it is perhaps Instructive for us to remember what our predecessors in the Congress wrote in the Wagner Act. the bedrock of labor law in the United States. In the Wagner Act. Congress encouraged the practice of collective bargainingnot bankruptcyto resolve disputes between labor and management. Congress has repeatedly stated. not only in the Wagner Act but also on numerous other occasions. its intense desire to encourage the system of collective bargaining to resolve disputes in the workplace. In light of this incontestable fact. I would like to request that the rest of my colleagues unite behind the original intent of collective bargaining and the true meaning of contract negotiations by supporting H.R. 5174. so that we may take a positive step toward discipline and alleviating crisis.*
980217445,"I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker. I stand before you todayvery pleased and very proudthat one of my first pieces of legislation as a freshman Congressman. H.R. 4308. is. under consideration. I would like to commend my colleagues. on both sides of the aisle. for their discerning vision and support. of this legislation that could. quite conceivably. change the face of this Nation. for decades to come. There are so many people I would like to take time to thank. I would like to really take time to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee of Administrative Law and Governmental Relations. SAM B. HALL. JR.. for his dedication and his support. I .would like to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. PETER RODINO. for his support. Senator JOHN HEINZ. the Senator from Pennsylvania. gave me a lot of support. He came before the committee and testified on behalf of the bill. When I was a state legislator several years back. I worked very closely with Rick Geist. who is now chairman of the Interstate High Speed Rail Association of Pennsylvania. I would like to thank the U.S. Department of Transportation general counsel. Jim Marquez for his support and his letters. Quite definitely. I must thank. take the liberty and take the time to thank the 5 Governors who wrote letters to their Congressmen asking for their support: Gov. Dick Thornburg of Pennsylvania. Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio. Gov. James Blanchard of Michigan. Gov. William Thompson of Illinois. and Gov. Robert Orr of Indiana. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4308. would lay the crucial groundwork for establishing a modem. high speed. passenger train line through the Nations heartland. High speed rail promises not only to provide a safe. fast. and dependable means of transportation. but also. it would enable a revitalization of Americas basic Industries. while spurring a resurgence in the economy. Intrinsically. this bill provides congressionally required Federal consent to an agreement between the States of Pennsylvania. Ohio. Indiana. Illinois. Michigan. Kentucky. and West Virginla. to jointly fund and perform feasibility studies on a new system to connect cities in those States. To date. I am honored to report that there has been absolutely no opposition to the bill which is cosponsored by 65 Members of both political parties. In fact. at this moment. companion legislation sponsored by Senator JOHN HEINZ of Pennsylvania. is making its way through tile Senate. S. 2564 has met with considerable support in the Senate. Although the concept of highspeed rail brings to mind images of incredible speedsthe creation and implementation of legislation to achieve that end is not as fast in comparison. This program to improve transportation and industry in our region is. of course. a longterm project. It is only in the embryo stage. Like many other ideas. it has been discussed for years. but the time has come for movement. The Japanese. Germans. and the French. have had enormous success with highspeed rail in their countries. The Japanese. even during the lowest period of traffic for their line still posted a profit of $1.37 billion in 1979 alone. Clearly. my colleagues. this is no ""white elephant."" Of course. I am sure that one of the major factors that will please many of my colleagues is that no Federal moneys are involved in this bill. While there may be sonic among you who may have reservations about the evolution of a Federal program of this nature. allow me to reassure you that this is merely a Statesponsored program. which is seeking Federal recognition. The areement is for the participating State. to share administrative responsibilitici for a feasibility study of service to cities in the States. including personnel. equipment. office space. machinery. computers. engineering. and technical advice and services. It also sets up an advisory council of two representatives from each State. I would ask that each Member here today. reach within himself and pull out the admirable pioneering spirit of our forefathers. I realize that this compact in particular deals only with the States mentioned previously. however. how many of you can recall the dream of the ""TransContinental Railroad"" and the ""Golden Spike?"" I submit the fact that history can indeed repeat Itself. As I stand before you today. business people. bankers. laypeople. academicians. lawyers. politicians and others from all walks of life have concerned themselves -with the success of highspeed rail in America. So much so. that they have formed an international organization termed ""the HighSpeed Rail Association."" The States of II 6030 California. Nevada. New Mexico. Texas. Mississippi. Louisiana. Alabama. Florida. Wisconsin. Missouri. and Massachusetts are all currently exploring the possibility of highspeed rail in their respective regions. Without question. highspeed rail has the potential to spark a major upturn in the economies of all the States involved. Jobs will be created in areas such as steel. aluminium. specialized metals. high tech industries. as well as the positions that will be made available in a highspeed rail system. The United States is one of the few industrialized countries. that does not have some type of highspeed rail service. I believe that a highspeed rail system would provide the necessary inducements that we need: speed. safety. comfort. and dependability in order to prompt more people to travel by rail. Butuntil a foundation is laid through the existence of a feasibility study which will measure the efficacy of such a system. this dream of highspeed rail will remain just thata dream. That is why I appear before you today. so that progress can be made and that we may all look toward a more promising future. I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cast a vote for the future of America in this bipartisan effort and vote in favor of II.R. 4308. highspeed rail."
980267613,"Mr. Chairman. today I rise in support of the Steel Import Stabilization Act introduced by my colleague from Illinois. In light of recent developments on the steel issue. this bill. H.R. 6301. represents the best legislative vehicle for providing meaningful import relief to the domestic steel industry during these final days of the 98th Congress. The No. 1 issue back home in my district in western Pennsylvania is jobs. The steel industry has been suffering from Imports for the past several years. Thousands of steel workers have been laidoff. Sadly. most will never return to their former jobs. When I was elected to Congress in November 1982. many of those hardworking Americans were on the verge of losing their homes and all they had worked for. In some Instances. families were breaking up because neither spouse could provide enough for their family. Ultimately. the children suffered the most. Three critical elements of this bill offer a ray of hope for the domestic steel industry and its talented employees. First and foremost. this bill gives congressional authority to the President to enforce any bilateral agreement regarding imported steel products into the United States established as a part of the steel program announced on September 18. 1984. This bill urges the administration to achieve a 17 percent import penetrationlevel upon full implementation of the program. Limiting imports means we can control the damage being done to the domestic steel industry. According to a Congressional Research Service report entitled: ""Steel Import Limits: Estimated Import Reductions Under Three Alternative Proposals."" steel imports would decline under both the Presidents decision and H.R. 6301. The key factor I want to point out is that a far greater reduction in imports could be achieved by enactment of this bill. The CRS study finds that under the Presidents decision. should it achieve its goals. steel imports could be reduced to a level of 19.70 million tons. a drop of about 1.20 million tons. Under the Steel Import Stabilization Act. with its 17 percent market share target. steel imports would drop by about 4 million tons. With respect to jobs. the Presidents decision could mean that about 3.500 jobs might be saved. while under H.R. 6301. an estimated 11.000 steel jobs would be preserved. Second. this measure establishes conditionality for import relief. Steel makers must reinvest net cash flow from steel operations into new equipment and modernization. These dollars are vital if the domestic industry is to survive in a rapidly changing world. Nearly everyone in the industry acknowledges that in order to survive. a steelmaker must use continuous casting. Yet in 1983. only 31 percent of this Nations steel was continuously cast. During the same year. 60.4 percent of the European Economic Communitys steel. and 86.3 percent of Japans steel output was continuously cast. That is quite a difference. The U.S. steel industry needs the time and the capital to continue making itself world class. Linking import relief to investment establishes a set of checks and balances. and a signal to the industry and the financial markets that the Congress will not turn its back on one of this Nations most important industries during its period of crisis. Finally. this measure provides help for those former steelworkers in dire need of Job retraining. This bill reauthorizes the Trade Readjustment Assistance Program through 1987. It also directs steelmakers experiencing significant unemployment to devote I percent of net cash flow from steel operations to worker retraining. These two provisions address the critical question that we must answer in the coming years. How can we help the displaced worker? While trade adjustment assi3tance might not be the best program. it is one important alternative for those seeking an opportunity to help themselves. Just last week. one of my constituents who was laidoff from a specialty pipe and tube producer began retraining for a new future in the electronics field. This would have never been possible without TRA funds. Mr. Chairman. the steel industry has fought a long hard battle here in Washington. It serves the interests of no one to try and place blame on management. or labor. or Government. The domestic steel industry needs our help.

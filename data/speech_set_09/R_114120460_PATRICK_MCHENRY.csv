1140010610,Mr. Speaker. a week ago yesterday. the Nation lost one of its most selfless and unique public servants with the passing of my predecessor. former North Carolina 10th District Congressman Cass Ballenger. Up until 2005. Congressman Ballenger represented the 10th District of North Carolina in the United States House of Representatives. During that time. he served as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. where he authored groundbreaking legislation that improved workplace safety and created the opportunity for employers and regulators to be partners. not adversaries. in protecting the health and safety of workers. As chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on the International Relations Committee. he took on the daunting and often thankless task of fighting to promote democracy and defend human rights in Central and South American nations. He did this not only for the sake of justice in those countries. but also to protect the interests of the United States. His personal commitment to serving his constituents is a legendary example that I strive every day to follow. I was the beneficiary of his kind and gracious nature when I was elected to represent the 10th District in 2005 after his decision to retire from the House. He personally provided me with guidance and assistance that immeasurably helped me as a new Member of Congress and ensured continuity of our quality constituent services for western North Carolina. In his personal and professional life. Cass placed others before himself. He was a part of the Greatest Generation. He fought in World War II and returned home to go to college. He started a family and joined his fathers business in box manufacturing. He told his father that boxes were a thing of the past and the wave of the future was plastics. It is almost like it was George Bailey coming home to say that. As a county commissioner in Catawba County. he was one of the first Republicans elected after the Civil War. Now. at this date. Catawba County is one of the most Republican counties in the State of North Carolina. He led the way to establish the Catawba Valley Community College and Catawba Valley Medical Center. As a legislator in the North Carolina General Assembly. he authored the States first meaningful open meetings law and was named Most Effective Republican Legislator by the North Carolina Institute of Government. It would take volumes to talk about all of the philanthropic work of Congressman Ballenger and his wife. Donna. but they are responsible for countless schools. day care centers. hospitals. and disaster responses in the United States and Central and South America as well. Personally. Cass was the ultimate character. He could tell you a great story. a great joke. and tell you off. and you would laugh at everything he said. In addition to being one of the most distinguished Members of the House and the North Carolina Republican delegation generally. Congressman Ballenger was also very colorful. There are great moments here on the House floor that we can point to. Anyone who spent any time with him knew that he was affable. kind. and brutally honest. He would tell you exactly what he was thinking. and generally with a hilarious delivery. He was one of the few people who could hold someone accountable in the most blistering way possible. make you laugh. and also help you out of a tight spot. all in one conversation. He was a rare person. indeed. and he will be missed. I ask my colleagues to join with me in a moment of silence on the passing of Congressman Cass Ballenger. ESEA
1140054286,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey . the chairman of the Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee. for yielding time. I thank the gentlewoman from New York . the ranking member of the subcommittee. for working with me on the provisions of the bill we are talking about this afternoon. I also want to thank the gentlewoman from California . the ranking member of the full committee. for working with us to craft this compromise we have on the floor here today. I have joined together with my colleagues from across the aisle to offer a Federal exemption from registering for the resale of private company securities. which is vital for adding liquidity to the secondary markets and driving economic growth. Today private growth companies are not only disrupting existing industries. but are creating entirely new markets. Thanks to private markets. in particular. the advancement in American technology and entrepreneurship is thriving. Funding the growth of these private companies. however. has created a paradigm shift. This shift requires our regulatory framework to achieve a balance between encouraging innovation and growth while ensuring that shareholders and investors are protected. and those investor protections need to remain strong. Unfortunately. as successful entrepreneurs and startup employees look to sell their private shares in the secondary markets. they encounter a regulatory framework that is inefficient. That inefficiency is costly and dries up the liquidity of these securities and is harmful to economic growth. Most private secondary transactions rely on a broadly accepted exemption known as section 4(1)(1/2). While widely known and applied. section 4(l)(12) has never been formally codified into securities law. The result has been a disjointed collection of case law and noaction SEC letters that have shaped these private secondary transactions. Our bill attempts to fix this problem. The bill would provide an exemption for these types of transactions. allowing startup employees the ability to execute trades in a way that is consistent. clear. and certain. That is why we have Federal securities laws. for that certainty. that clarity. and that consistency. It would allow for private companies to find a much better way to raise capital by opening up the secondary markets. Although the bill is a technical fix. we have worked hard to seek compromise and find commonsense solutions to this complicated exemption. While we have negotiated in good faith on this bill. as has the party across the aisle. my goal is to ensure that the language and operation of this compromise will work in the real world. Further improvements to the bill may be necessary to fully codify existing uses of that authority. and I am committed to working with my colleagues across the aisle as well as folks in the Senate to clarify the intent here. I look forward to continuing to work with our ranking member of the full Committee on Financial Services. as necessary. to ensure that the law is a useful tool and serves as an example of how policy can meet the demands of a changing marketplace. The bottom line is this bill is a sensible way forward. This bill will lower costs and provide transparent standards for the issues that are important in the private and secondary transactions. Additionally. the bill will give todays private growth companies a foundation on which they can confidently plan their trajectory through the capital markets. both private and public. Ultimately. codifying this exemption will ensure the United States remains the best market in the world for the worlds innovators to build their businesses here and employ Americans and grow our economy. I am pleased that this legislation enjoys bipartisan support. and I urge my colleagues to support it.
1140104430,on this legislation. It just goes to show that when the opposite side of the aisle is not focused on trying to destroy and undo DoddFrank. we can get to doing some credible legislation. So I am very. very pleased about this legislation. It is another piece of legislation intended to help our Nations startups and the venture capitalists who take a chance on them by providing a targeted exemption for certain venture capital funds. It is also a piece of legislation that appropriately balances the ability of a startup to raise capital with the need to protect investors in the startup. When we fail to strike this balance. investors suffer. small businesses suffer. and when taken to the extreme. our entire economy can suffer. During consideration of this bill in committee. Mr. MCHENRY and I offered an amendment to create a new exemption for qualifying venture capital funds that have no more than 250 investors and only $10 million in invested capital. These smaller funds will allow angel investor groups to better pool their resources among more accredited investors to make targeted. highimpact investments in the very companies they create the most jobs: startups. This structure is used today by AngelList. a company that matches investors meeting certain income and asset thresholds to pool their money into a special purpose fund and invest together in startup companies. Importantly. both the companies and the investors benefit from this structure. compared with making hundreds of smaller direct investments. A company. for example. only has a single point of contact. the angel fund advised by fiduciary. rather than hundreds of investors who all must individually approve corporate actions such as acquisitions and expanding ownership. Investors also like this structure because they can delegate monitoring the startups they invest in to the investment adviser to fund. Such monitoring may be significant. considering that investors typically diversify among 30 to 80 companies. H.R. 4854. as amended. is appropriately tailored to only certain venture capital funds. which must invest at least 80 percent of their committed capital in the equity of small companies. Under the bill. those funds must have no more than 250 investors and no more than $10 million in this invested capital. ensuring that they are small enough that investors are able to monitor and manage their investments with the funds. This language ensures that we arent creating a loophole for other investment companies. like mutual funds. to avoid regulation. nor are we providing relief to other private funds. like hedge funds or private equity funds. that have very little restrictions and investor protections. Finally. I would like to express my appreciation of Mr. MCHENRYs efforts to make changes to this bill addressing some of the concerns of investor advocates. like the Consumer Federation of America and Americans for Financial Reform. His efforts have made this a good bill that deserves our support. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140104432,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman of the Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee. and I rise today to support the Supporting Americas Innovators Act. Mr. Speaker. these days. American small businesses are facing a capital crisis. This is particularly true for earlystage companies and startups. Despite the headlines from Silicon Valley. the truth is that the vast majority of earlystage companies are not securing venture capital funding. Indeed. almost 80 percent of startup investment goes to just three States in these United States. Meanwhile. angel investing for these earlystage companies is challenging. Investing in startup companies is inherently risky. which is why the wealthy investors who qualify to become angels often shy away from it. This is why we need to address the challenges facing angel investing. This is accomplished by changing our mindset and creating a regulatory framework that encourages innovation and growth. while ensuring that shareholder and investor protections remain strong. Ranking Member WATERS and I proposed an amendment that would increase the cap of investors from 100 to 250 for accredited investors of angel funds. and this would only apply to qualifying venture funds narrowly tailored to earlystage investing. What we have before us in the full House is a great work of compromise. and I thank the ranking member. Ms. WATERS. for her diligent work. working with my staff and her staff together over many long hours to come up with this compromise that we have that will. I believe. garner bipartisan support like it did in the Financial Services Committee. I do thank the ranking member for working diligently to make this outcome possible. The result of our proposed amendment and what we have before us allows for earlystage companies to raise the capital they need by opening up angel investing to more accredited investors. This is a good bill. It is a compromise bill. and I am pleased that this legislation enjoyed wide support. I urge my colleagues to support it and vote for it. and lets get this thing done and signed by the President.
1140104454,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the Fix Crowdfunding Act. Mr. Speaker. these days. small businesses are struggling to find the financing investment that they need to start up and to grow. That affects jobs. It certainly does. Recently in my district. we have read reports that smaller counties in America. which used to lead the Nation in the growth of new businesses. now have actually lost more businesses than they have created. The reason why the ranking member and I are actually able to work together on an important piece of legislation like this in a very logjammed discussion point about appropriate regulationa lot of stuff gets locked up in partisan debatewhat unites our conversation is a rural issue and an urban issue. and it is about capital deserts in America. Now. everybody talks about food deserts. If you think about this. if you are not close to a grocery store. then you cant get fresh fruit. fresh vegetables. and you cant get foodstuffs for your family. But we have capital deserts in America. Capital deserts are about those areas that are not Boston. Austin. and Silicon Valley. It is the rest of America that is struggling to get the capital they need so they can start a business. so they can grow a business. I am not talking about the next Google or Facebookmaybe it is. I am talking about a lawn service. I am talking about a coffee shop. I am talking about a baker who wants to sell her goods on a wider scale so that she can provide for her family. Those are the concerns that are real and that we can address in a real way before Congress todaytonightin this vote. Investment crowdfunding is one way we can reverse this disturbing trend. What this bill does is allow us to expand what you are able to do through investment crowdfunding. Five years ago in the JOBS Act. we had a revolutionary change to the way we allowed individuals to invest a little bit of money in their fellow men. It allowed men or women in local communities to invest in a local coffee shop. You didnt have to be a wealthy investor to get these great opportunities. You could be the average. everyday investor like me or like many of my constituents. But in the JOBS Act and in the investment crowdfunding part of that bill that I wrote 5 years ago. out of that. the Securities and Exchange Commission wrote four regulations. and they created a couple of major challenges as a result of that. One is the 12(g) problem. Let me explain this. What the 12(g) problem is is that. in essence. you are subjecting very low fundraising to very expensive regulatory disclosures. That is a problem. It is a problem because it is costly. It is economically costly and restricts economic opportunity. We fixed that in the Fix Crowdfunding Act. Another significant problem for crowdfunding is that under SEC rules. singlepurpose funds are not permitted. Let me explain this. Singlepurpose funds are like this: you have somebody who has a fiduciary responsibility. meaning that I am going to look out for your best interests on this investment and we are able to create a fund in order to pool those resources. that investor acumen. if you will. and work together with them. So it allows unsophisticated people to get sophisticated advice if we allow special purpose vehicles. So these two very important provisions. understood at a very simple level. if we fix these things we will provide more economic opportunity. we will have better investor advice. and we will be able to expand and make real the utility of crowdfunding. The essence of this is that we believe in the capacity of individual Americans to make decisions for themselves and to take a little bit of risk for themselves. It is a powerful thing. It is a powerful. meaningful step forward. Now. it doesnt solve the greater debate that we are having here in Washington on so many challenging issues of policy where perhaps the left and the right dont see eye to eye. But on this. we came together and we were able to create a small opening of economic opportunity and try to get those resources out into the community. It is a meaningful step forward. I thank the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee. I thank Ranking Member WATERS for her active engagement on this. She helped improve our original bill that came through the Financial Services Committee 5 years ago. and she has helped work through this compromise before us on the House floor tonight. While we may not agree on so many other issues of policy. we have worked together on two substantive areas of policy here in recent weeks. I think that is a hopeful sign. I think it is a positive sign. What we are doing here today will expand that opportunity for millions of Americans to have that little bit of investment that they would like to make in their fellow man and their fellow woman to create new jobs to provide new economic opportunity. Ladies and gentlemen. I ask and encourage your support for the Fix Crowdfunding Act. and I urge an ""aye"" vote."
1140107443,Mr. Speaker. I also rise today to honor a great man and a great friend. one of my constituents from Catawba County. Dave Hearn has served as president of the Catawba County Chamber of Commerce and has done so for the last 12 years. He recently announced his retirement from 43 years of work with chambers of commerce throughout the southeast. Danny is a graduate of LenoirRhyne University. Shortly after graduation. he went to work at the local chamber of commerce as an intern. and that career would last him until actually just a few months from now. He served local chambers. rising through the ranks from Norfolk. Virginia. Rockingham. North Carolina. Statesville. North Carolina. and he will finish his career in Hickory. Danny is well known for a couple of different things in the community. Danny is most well known for his commitment to small business. He has fought tirelessly on behalf of the small business community and the business community generally. In fact. one of the greatest accomplishments at the Catawba County Chamber of Commerce under Dannys leadership is the Edison project. a competitive contest that awards muchneeded startup capital to local entrepreneurs. He began this initiative in the midst of one of the worst economic downturns in western North Carolina history. Danny knows that the backbone of our local economy and the backbone of our country is small business. He understands that small business development is the key to our regions economic development. growth. and recovery. Dannys work with small businesses has truly paid off. Recent statistics show that wages in Catawba County are growing at a faster rate than most counties in the country. and this is a great success under Dannys leadership. Danny is also extraordinarily well known for his love of golf. Dannys secondtolast day on the job in September will be hosting the chambers annual golf tournament. What a fitting way and a truly poetic way for Danny to end his chamber career. He will be doing two of the great things that he is passionate about: working with small businesses leaders and playing golf. So to Danny: You will truly be missed in Catawba County. Your leadership will be truly missed. However. your impact will be felt for generations to come. We thank you for your leadership. and I thank you for your friendship.

1130004251,"I thank the gentleman from Lubbock for yielding. and Im proud to be a part of this Special Order. I want to say at the very beginning that. unlike Congressman NEUGEBAUER. I did not know Chris Kyle or Chad Littlefield. the other individual who was killed. They both lived in my congressional district in Midlothian. Texas. and the tragedy of both of their early deaths is equal. Although I didnt know either one. I have studied up on them. and I went to the memorial service at Cowboy Stadium and was very moved by the eulogies and the peoples remembrances that did know them. I would like to say with regards to Mr. Littlefield. he. too. was a lifelong Texan. born in Dallas. and went to high school in DeSoto. He would have turned 36 Monday. and his funeral was at the Midlothian First Baptist Church last Friday. He is survived by his wife. Leanne. who is a middle school principal in Midlothian. and. I believe. a daughter. So our hearts go out to that family. too. With regards to Chris. you could not have attended the service on Monday at the Cowboy Stadium and not have come away very impressed. The press reports are that there were 5.000 to 7.000 in attendance. I have done a number of events at Cowboy Stadium. I asked the head of security for the Cowboys who I know what they estimated the crowd. They said about 11.000. As Mr. NEUGEBAUER has already pointed out. Chris was an individual who was driven by a love for his country and a love for his fellow man. I thought it was very telling at the service that the mother of one of his Navy SEALs who had been killed in combat. Chris adopted her as a second mother and asked that some of the proceeds of his book ""American Sniper"" go to her family. That. to me. is just amazing. The president of Craft International also spoke at the service. and he spoke about how much Chris really cared about other people. I think it is very telling that Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield were both killed trying to help another troubled veteran. They were taking the suspected murderer to a gun range over in I think near Glen Rose. Texas. and trying to help him work through some problems. The person they were trying to help turned on them. So he died trying to help another person who was in need. and thats something his family can be very proud of. I think another thing that we need to say about Chris is when people met him. they liked him and wanted to help him. The number of people who have helped in these service arrangements runs the gamut: The Governor of Texas. Governor Perry. who helped arrange the cemetery plot at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin. Jerry Jones and his family. the owner of the Cowboys. I think donated the use of Cowboys Stadium and were personally in attendance at the funeral. all the law enforcement agencies in the DFW area helped arrange the cavalcade from Midlothian down to Austin. And I am told that at almost every overpass on Interstate 35 and U.S. 287 that there were people showing flags and in attendance. There was an outpouring of love and affection that in my knowledge in the Congress is just unheard of for somebody who was not a public figure. And Chris was not. He was a public patriot. but he was not an ostentatious. grandstand kind of person. He loved his family. He loved his two children. He loved his wife. He loved his mother and father. And he loved those whom he served with in the military. As Mr. NEUGEBAUER has pointed out. he served a number of tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. In one of the stories that is in his book. he was under orders not to fire unless fired upon. In order to get the enemy so that he could shoot them. he put up an American flag. stood up and basically dared them to take a shot at him. And I think this is correct from the book. that when they started shooting at him he got everybody to take a shot at him. and he silenced them. So. Congressman NEUGEBAUER. you are to be commended for organizing this Special Order. Im proud that Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield were constituents of mine. Im very proud their families still live in my district. Myself and my staff will do everything we can to help them. We will cherish the memory of Chris and Chad for many. many years. With that. I appreciate the gentlemans courtesy and I yield back."
1130016301,Mr. Chair. when this same bill or bill similar to it was on the House floor last year. I had to reluctantly rise in opposition to it because it was my opinion that the privacy protections in the bill were not sufficient to protect the privacy of the American people. I think that surprised a lot of people that I was not for the bill. After the bill failed to move in the Senate. I went to Chairman ROGERS and I told him that I supported the underlying intent of the bill and I was hopeful that. if the bill came back up in this session. he and myself and our staffs could work together to improve the privacy protections. He promised then that he would do it. and Chairman ROGERS and his staff have been men and women of their word. The result is a bill that was reported out of the Intelligence Committee on a bipartisan basis with much stronger privacy protections. When I went to the Rules Committee. Chairman ROGERS supported that this amendment Im about to offer should be made in order. and it has been. And if this amendment is acceptedand Im told that the chairman and the ranking member are going to support it. as Im not aware of any organized opposition to itit is going to be my intent to vote for the bill. We obviously have a cyber threat that faces the American people. and Chairman ROGERS and Ranking Member RUPPERSBERGER have talked about that in some detail earlier in this debate. We want to combat that threat. But in doing it. we do not want to eliminate or weaken the privacy protections of the American people that we represent in this body. So what my amendment does is make sure that any information that is collected is going to be used simply for the purpose of protecting against cyber threats. Its a very short amendment. It adds a new section to the bill. section 4. Here I will read the amendment since its in clear English and very short. Nothing in this act or the amendments made by this act shall be construed to provide new or alter any existing authority for an entity to sell personal information of a consumer to another entity for marketing purposes. What this does. Mr. Chair. is simply nail down the fact that when we find information that might be necessary to protect against a cyber threat. thats all its going to be used for. It cant be used for any other purpose. As I said earlier. Chairman ROGERS has worked very closely with myself. and his staff has worked with my staff. Congressman MARKEY of Massachusetts. who is the cochairman of the Privacy Caucus. strongly supports this amendment. Again. I think it was unanimously accepted at the Rules Committee. Im aware of no opposition. so I hope that we can adopt the amendment. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130053174,"Mr. Speaker. for the last hour. the minority in the House. the Democrat Party. has had the right to speak to the American people in their leadership Special Hour. I think the gentleman from Oregon and the gentleman from California did a good job of presenting the side of the story as they viewed it. Having said that. Mr. Speaker. the late Paul Harvey had a radio program for many. many years that many of us listened to. and in that radio program he would tell us ""The Rest of the Story."" Well. Mr. Speaker. for the next hour. those of us on the majority side. the Republican sidemost of us from Texas. although were going to have some friends from Michigan and perhaps from Florida. tooare going to tell you the other side of the story. the rest of the story. And lets start by discussing this continuing mantra from the minority side that we ought to just bring up the clean continuing resolution. or CR. from the other body. the Senate. and life would be perfect. Well. Mr. Speaker. theres one tiny. small problem with that. And that is. Mr. Speaker. that that continuing resolution funds the discretionary part of something that is legally called the Affordable Care Act. but most people in the United States are now calling it ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker. ObamaCare is a huge new entitlement. Its not just another Federal program. It changes. fundamentally. the way we practice medicine in the United States of America. It changes. fundamentally. the rights of Americans. Mr. Speaker. ObamaCare mandatesforcesevery American to have health insurance. whether they want it or whether they need it. Its a huge new right taken away. a freedom. Heretofore. weve said that people had the right to choose whether they wanted health insurance or not. And now were going to tell them. at the Federal level. they to have it. That is not a trivial right to take away from the American people. Mr. Speaker. the Affordable Care Act. ObamaCare. mandates that every employer that has at least 50 employees must provide health insurance. Heretofore. health insurance had been considered a fringe benefit. Some employers provided it. some employers did not. Now. according to the Affordable Care Act. or ObamaCare. you have to provide health insurance. What thats done. Mr. Speaker. is caused many small businesses to reduce their workforce. to change their work hours. Many employees that were fulltime. 40hour employees. have become 20- or less than 30hour parttime employees. Again. a huge change in the way Americans have conducted their business. Mr. Speaker. there are many mandates in the Affordable Care Act. or ObamaCare. that relate to how you practice medicine. Many health care practitioners have told me in my district that theyre not going to practice. Theyre going to retire. Theyre not going to put up with all the mandates. Theyre not going to put up with all of the paperwork. Again. something that is fundamentally changing the United States of America. Mr. Speaker. in the Affordable Care Act. or ObamaCare. there are all kinds of mandates on what has to be included in insurance. how the insurance companies have to provide it. what premiums they can charge. Because of this. Mr. Speaker. many insurance companies have raised their premiums. Many insurance companies have changed their policies. Again. a fundamental change. So. Mr. Speaker. when our friends in the minority on the other side say. Just bring up a clean CR and well vote for it. they dont point out that that clean CR includes funding for ObamaCare. It is. again. a fundamental change. Mr. Speaker. Most of us on the Republican side. the majority side. dont want that. We want the freedom to choose. I would ask my friends on the minority side. if ObamaCare is so great. why does it have to be mandatory? Lets make it voluntary. Republicans happen to support many of the things in it. We support coverage for preexisting conditions. We support allowing young adults to stay on their parents life insurance until they reach the age of 26. We support the concept of the public exchanges. In the Republican alternative. when ObamaCare was passed. we had something called ""coops."" Not exactly like these health exchanges. but certainly similar. So. again. if this act is so good and so great and everybody loves it. lets make it voluntary. How about making it voluntary for a year and just let the people choose? If these health exchanges are great. people are going to flock to them. If all of these mandates are really worthwhile. make them voluntary based on free choice and the market. and most of those will be accepted and implemented. So that might be an alternative at some point in time to consider. Take all the mandates away. leave the structure of the law. and let the American people choose whether they wish to participate. Mr. Speaker. there is another side to this story. In the next 50 or 55 minutes. the Texas delegation on the Republican side. with some help from friends in other States. are going to tell you the other side of the story. With that. I would like to yield to Congressman WEB3ER from Friendswood. Texas."
1130062361,Can you imagine that. if we are having the horrendous problems we are having on just getting people interacted with making choices of which kind of coverage they are going to choose. the problems you are going to have when you actually begin to have to use the system for real health care in January? So I and. I think. you and the other members of the Republican Study Committee task force on health. who helped prepare the legislation that you are talking about. are going to begin to push to delay the Affordable Care Act. I have a bill. H.R. 3348. that makes it voluntary the first year in that we are not going to impose the individual mandate on people. The President has already delayed the employer mandate for a year. My bill. H.R. 3348. would delay the individual mandate so that. as we work through all of the problems. people can choose to participate or can choose not to participate. I think it is becoming more apparent every day that the Affordable Care Act is like that shiny automobile that you see when you go into the showroom or go to the car lot. You see it. and the salesman says. Man. this thing is great. It gets 30 miles a gallon. It doesnt use much oil. Everything is power steering. and it has airconditioning and a great stereo system. So you put down your down payment. and you take it out on the road. Son of a gun. The thing doesnt go above 50. It burns oil like it is going out of style. The airconditioning doesnt work. The stereo system barely works. It is just a lemon. The Affordable Care Act is a lemon. and the American people and the Democrats on the other side of the aisle who voted for it are having buyers remorse. So what we need to do is to delay it or to repeal it or to at least make it voluntary. Then lets look at some of these alternatives like the legislation that we put into play in which we give people real choices. It is a patientcentered. clientcentered system. We allow insurance to be sold across State lines. We beef up affordable savings accounts. Health Savings Accounts. We do cover preexisting conditions. which I know you will talk about later on. but we do it with a highrisk pool on a StatebyState basis. The Democrats have told us time after time in the general debate that you Republicans are against the Affordable Care Act. but you dont have an alternative. We have an alternative. and I think it is a good alternative. I am a sponsor of the legislation. and I am here to support you in this Special Order. As we go through and outline what is in it. I think the American people and the other Members of the House who are watching these proceedingsmore and more of themwill say. We dont like that lemon that we have. Maybe we ought to go back. and maybe we ought to start over. Maybe some of these ideas in the alternative we should take a serious look at. So I commend you for your work on the legislation. and I also commend you for leading this Special Order this evening.
1130069325,"Mr. Speaker. I thank both my friend on the majority side and my friend on the minority side for allowing me this unusual procedure. I do rise in support of the rule.

I do thank my good friend from GeorIt is not going to get any easier. Mr. What we are doing on the underlying gia and my good friend from New York Speaker. to solve this problem by pass- bill. Mr. Speaker. with this socalled for allowing me to speak."
1130113847,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee. Mr. SESSIONS. I hope we will yield back some of that time. First. I want to thank you. Mr. Chairman. for the leadership you have exhibited. not just in the Rules Committee. but on this issue in general. You have been a longtime advocate of substantive immigration reform in a conservative way. You have been active this week in the Conference and in the Texas delegation as we attempt to move this legislation. And. of course. you have been very active this afternoon in the Rules Committee. I want to also compliment the leadership of the majority as we have tried to craft a compassionate conservative path forward. I happen to be an advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. I have a draft bill that I have been waiting until the right time to introduce. and. hopefully. get bipartisan support. I am not one of these ""just say no"" Republicans. Having said that. we have a crisis on our southern border because of some actions the President has taken in the past and some inactions that he is not taking now. We have got this terrible situation where thousands and thousands of young childrensome unaccompanied. by themselves. others with adultswho have been flooding the southern border. allegedly some of them paying thousands of dollars to individuals who are allegedly related to the drug cartels. It is an unsustainable situation. Mr. Speaker. It cant go on. The bill that is going to be before the body later this evening targets funding to add additional judges to review these children on a casebycase basis. It reverses current law so that children from noncontiguous countries are treated the same as the children from Canada and Mexico who perhaps attempt to come into the country without proper documentation. I dont think it is an inhumane thing to do. Mr. Speaker. I think it is actually the right thing to do. The bill before us is going to have funds to reimburse the States that have decided to deploy their National Guardsmen to the border. One of those States is my State of Texas. This bill would target funding to reimburse the State of Texas for the cost of deploying the National Guard. I think that is a good thing. The bill before us is going to be completely offset. taking money that has already been appropriated but not expended. The offsets are not fake. they are not: in the 10th year we will theoretically save some money that would have otherwise been spent. These offsets are for funds that have been appropriated and have been obligated but not used. Some of those funds are in the foreign aid accounts of the countries that are sending us some of their citizens. and I think that is appropriate. We can have a debate at the appropriate time on a more comprehensive package. That is obviously something that at some point I hope this body addresses. I am going to be an active. positive participant in that. Mr. Speaker. But for today. to solve the current situation on the border. this is a targeted package. It will be better than current law if it is enacted. It will improve the situation. I think. within the next 2 months. If it were to be enacted in its totality. you would basically not have the problem of the unaccompanied minor children or minors with adults that are flooding our borders. It is a conservative approach. I will tell my friends on the minority side. I happen to be proud of that. I believe that the body is going to pass this. I am going to vote for both bills. the appropriation supplemental and then the DACA bill that Congresswoman BLACKBURN has expressed leadership on and done such a good job on. and of which I am a cosponsor. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee for giving me some time. I strongly support the rule. and I will vote for the underlying bills."
1130115192,Mr. Speaker. the Congress is not spoofing when we say we are going to do something about those individuals that do try to spoof the American public. As has been pointed out. we passed a law back in. actually. it was the 2009 act. but we passed it in 2010. the Truth in Caller ID Act. to mitigate the effects of caller spoofing. As you well know. you look on your caller ID and you see that an innocent or innocuous individual or company is calling you. as has been pointed out. It could be the police department. could be the Pizza Hut. could be almost anything. so you take the call and that is not what it is. In many cases they are trying to defraud our elderly in some scam or something like this. So we passed a law that we thought would handle it. But it needs to be updated. and that is what this bill does. As has been pointed out. it makes it illegal to initiate these calls from outside the United States. It makes it illegal to do it over the Internet with a Voice Over Internet Protocolbased system. And it also broadens the jurisdiction to include text messaging. As we well know. Mr. Speaker. text messaging is ubiquitous now on our Blackberrys and our iPads and iPhones and all of our personal telecommunication devices. This bill has bipartisan support. The subcommittee chairman. Mr. WALDEN. is an original cosponsor. The subcommittee ranking member. Ms. ESHOO of California. is a cosponsor. Chairman Emeritus on the Democratic side JOHN DINGELL is a cosponsor. I am an original sponsor. So this is one of these instances. Mr. Speaker. that Republicans and Democrats are united. Chairman UPTON. the full committee chairman. and Mr. WAXMAN. the full committee ranking member. are totally supportive. There is every indication that. if this body passes this bill this evening. it will go to the other body. the United States Senate. and we fully expect it to pass it. This is one of those rare birds in this Congress that might actually be signed by the President of the United States. There is no known opposition to the bill. Our stakeholders. as Mr. MATHESON has pointed out. support it. Google supports it. The FCC supports it. AT&T. CTIA. Microsoft. USTelecom. Vonage. Verizon. and AARP are just some of the more popularly known stakeholders that support the bill. So I rise in strong support. Mr. Speaker. that we unanimously pass H.R. 3670. the AntiSpoofing Act of 2013. and send it to the Senate for its consideration. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130124920,Mr. Speaker. we have had a number of Congressmen come on the House floor and tell anecdotes about RALPH. about how funny he was and how smart he was. and they are allat least the ones about how smart he wasvery true. We have heard the urban myth about waiting on Bonnie and Clyde. which I do not believe is true. We have heard about Ted Williams and RALPH and Ted playing on the same baseball team in World War II. and that is true. We have heard about the offer to serve as a fight promoter for Cassius Clay. who later became Muhammad Ali. and that is true. A few more that you may not know: He was good friends with the Hunt brothers in Dallas and Clint Murchison. who was the original owner of the Dallas Cowboys. At one time. he was asked to be general counsel for what we today call the NFL. which he turned down. I got to know RALPH when I got elected in 1984. He and I served districts that touch each other. We both live in our districts in Texas. and so we became good buddies because we were always on the first flight to Texas after the last vote at the end of the week and on the last flight before the first vote to Washington at the beginning of the week. Once we built up enough frequent flyer miles. when there was a complimentary upgradewe never spent taxpayer dollars to fly in first classwe would fight over who got seat 4F. Because RALPH sweettalked the special service people at American Airlines. he always won. The only time I have ever gotten seat 4F on American Airlines was when RALPH was not on the plane. You have heard about the fact that he used to be a Democrat. He was until 2003 or 2004 when he switched parties. One of the first times that I realized how important RALPH HALL was is when the first President Bush won the election to be President of the United States. They called a special meeting over at the Capitol Hill Club on behalf of the National Republican Campaign Committee so that the Republicans in the Congress. who were in the minority. could have a meeting with the incoming President. We thought that was pretty special. There was a stir in the crowd. We thought it was the President coming in. and it was. The President walked into the room of the Eisenhower Lounge. which the Republicans will know is on the first floor at the Capitol Hill Club. Before the President began to speak. there was another stir. Through another door that I have never seen used who do you think came into the Capitol Hill Club but RALPH HALL. Now. what is surprising about that is that at the time. RALPH HALL was a Democrat. RALPH HALL had endorsed George H.W. Bush for President when he was a Democrat. and so he got special recognition at that Capitol Hill meeting. There have been many great Members from Texas that served in the House since our creation as a State in 1845. Mr. Speaker. Some of the ones that I have enjoyed working with in my tenure are people like Bill Archer of Houston. Jake Pickle. Steve Bartlett. and Sam Hall. but none has been more beloved and none has been more effective than RALPH HALL of Rockwall. Texas. I have some other things to say. but I see that others are here. so I yield to
1130124946,"I want to thank the Congressman from Chicago. the Reverend BoBBY RUSH. for recognizing me. Mr. Speaker. we always in Texas refer to the former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn who served for 48 years as ""Man of the House."" In fact. there have been books written about Rayburn with that title. ""The Man of the House."" I am a sixgeneration native Texan. so I certainly would be considered to be somewhat Texascentric. In all honesty. I would have to say that the ultimate and true man of the House is the Honorable JOHN DINGELL of Michigan. His father served before him. elected. I believe. while President Roosevelt was President of the United States. and JOHN DINGELL literally grew up in the House of Representatives. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7. 1941. President Roosevelt. I believe. the very next day. December 8. addressed a joint session of Congress in his famous Day of Infamy speech. JOHN DINGELL was on the floor to hear that speech in person. not as a Congressman. but as the son of a Congressman. He got elected to replace his father when his father passed away in 1955 and. as has been mentioned. has served longer than any other Member of Congress in the history of this Nation. If you count not only his service in Congress. but the time he spent as a child when his father was in Congress. he has literally been in the House for almost a third of its existence as an institution. I am not sure how many Members he has served with. but it is in the neighborhood of 2.500 Members that he has personally served with. When I got elected to Congress in 1984. I did not get on the Energy and Commerce Committee in my freshman year. but I did my sophomore year in 1986. JOHN DINGELL was then chairman and was chairman until the Republicans took the majority in the election in 1994. so I served with Chairman Dingell for my first 10 years in the Congress. He was a chairman in every sense of the word. The legislation that he helped craft during his chairmanship is some of the most important in the history of this Congress. Certainly. things that he would be most proud of would be the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. some of the health care legislation. and some of the telecommunications legislation. Those are laws that were passed under his chairmanship and are still the basic law in their field in this country. When I became chairman in 2003. he was the ranking Democrat on the committee. He helped me. sometimes in public. sometimes behind the scenes. Even when he didnt agree with the legislation that the Republican majority was pushing. he was always thoughtful and giving me tips on procedure and process and sometimes policy. When we passed a bill to move television from analog to digital. I wanted to put a date certain very quickly. With his counsel. he convinced me that we should draw that out. and he also said: ""The final date of the transition shouldnt be until after the Super Bowl. just in case there is a problem. people will get to watch the Super Bowl and wont be cussing you and the Congress for moving from analog to digital."" He was absolutely right on that. With Chairman UPTONs leadership. who is on the floor this eveningseveral years ago. I went to Chairman UPTON and suggested that we ask the Speaker to name the Energy and Commerce main committee room on the first floor of the Rayburn Building. 2123. the JOHN DINGELL Room. Chairman UPTON thought that was a great idea. He recommended it to the Speaker. and that now is the John Dingell Room. I could go on and on. Mr. Speaker. but I do want to say that we are truly losing one of the giants of the Congress when JOHN DINGELL retires at the end of this session. He is still going to be here. His wife. Debbie. has been elected to succeed him. so hopefully. we will still see him in the Congress. but I really have difficulty imagining a Congress that JOHN DINGELL is not a member of. He will be missed. We honor him. and I consider it a personal privilege that he calls me a friend. I thank the gentleman from Chicago for yielding me some time."

I rise today to congratulate Warden Linda Sanders. head of Springfield Missouris U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (USMCFP). on her recent national recognition by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Agency for Excellence in Prison Management. This distinguished honor highlights outstanding wardens for overall management of staff. inmates. and efficient operations. In earning this award. Warden Sanders was evaluated on the impact of her innovative ideas on the institutional programs she oversees. her steadfast efforts to improve the USMCFP. and extraordinary leadership as the head of her team. Additionally. this honor is a testament to Warden Sanders impressive career in our justice system. In 1987. she got her start as a correctional officer in a lowsecurity facility in Sandstone. Minnesota. After proving her exemplary work ethic. she was eventually named Warden of Lompoc U.S. Penitentiary in California. where she was the first female warden and first African American warden. Ultimately. after vying for the opportunity to lead the USMCFP. she was assigned as the medical centers warden in 2012. Overseeing the USMCFP. Warden Sanders is responsible for upholding a renowned institution with a rich American history dating back to the Great Depression. At that time. Springfield residents gave 620 acres to the federal government for the construction of a hospital complex. of which the first buildings were completed in 1933. Since. the center has cared for the physical and mental ailments of federal prisoners from across the nation. The prison even hosted a handful of prisoners with infamous names in American justice lore. like John Gotti. Robert Stroud (the Birdman of Alcatraz). and Larry Flyntjust to name a few. Mr. Speaker. Warden Linda Sanders deserves this bodys utmost respect for her dedication to our justice system. and I extend her my deepest appreciation for her impressive leadership. Her efforts have not only made Springfield a better community. but have made me everprouder to serve the people of Missouris seventh Congressional District.

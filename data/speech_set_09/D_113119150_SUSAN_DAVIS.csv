1130015162,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the contribution of the State of Israel as it celebrates its 65th anniversary as a vibrant and open democratic society. I had the great privilege to live and work in Israel in the mid1960s and celebrated Israels 22nd anniversary by taking part in a threeday walk from the shores of Tel Aviv to the hills of Jerusalem. Now about 50 years later. I marvel at the extraordinary changes that have taken place in Israel. In its 65 years. Israel has managed some incredible achievements. These have been true gifts to Americans and the worldhealing the sick. improving security. and promoting commerce. Israeli doctors and researchers have produced countless medical advances. Israelis have developed techniques to better assist cancer and Parkinsons patients. Israelis invented the PillCam to better detect disorders of the GI Tract. Israelis are pioneering robotic surgery. Israelis were key to developing the cell phonewhich has transformed American business and. of course. allowed many Jewish mothers. like myself. to instantly get in touch with their children. Israelis also invented voice mail technology. Israel developed the Iron Dome Missile Defense System which has already saved countless lives from missile attacks. And. Israel is sharing this vital technology with the United States. Israel is also a leader in conservation and renewable energy. In fact. Israel is the only country in the world that entered the 21st century with a net gain in its number of trees. made more remarkable because this was achieved in an area considered mainly desert. And. Israel continues to be a shining example of democratic governance in the Middle East. Israel is the only country in the Middle East with protections for free speech. free press. free practice of religion. womens rights and gay rights. All citizens of Israel have full voting rights without regard to race. sex. or ethnicity. And. Israels parliament. the Knesset. includes Jews and Arabs alike as members. Israel is a small country in a hostile environment that has found a way to accomplish big things. We as Americans are better off today because of Israels existence. And. as I wish Israel and her citizens a happy 65th birthday. I stress that I will continue working with my colleagues to support our closest friend and ally. as it continues to inspire the world with its achievement.
1130028243,I want to thank my colleagues on the committee for working together to bring forward a good bill. My thanks. of course. to Chairman WILSON and to the committee staff for working in a bipartisan manner. The bill contains a multitude of provisions to address the issue of sexual assault. and while it may seem that this year Congress focused on sexual assault in the military. the reality is that this committee and its members have been working hard to address this issue. which demands our attention. for the last several years. This committee has. once again. put forward a number of proposals. but as much as we would wish that legislation alone will stop someone from committing a sexual act. we know that is not the case. It will also not stop the fear of retaliation. which prevents a number of servicemembers from reporting a sexual assault. This problem and how we deal with it has to start and end with those who wear the uniform. but it is important that we provide them the tools they need to effectively change the system and. ultimately. the culture by holding perpetrators accountable and commanders and prosecutors to the highest standard. Whether through bystander intervention. command climates that do not tolerate or condone sexual harassment and innuendo. and appropriate prosecutions and command actions. our servicemembers are ultimately the change agents who need to step forward. This bill also focuses on the dependents and families who have sacrificed so much as well and who have been the backbone of support for our servicemembers through over a decade of war. Military families also bear the scars of war. and many need help as well. I am pleased that the bill includes a number of provisions to support families. including a provision that seeks to track the number of dependents who have taken their own lives by suicide. While the number of suicides for Active Duty members has increased. we have heard anecdotal evidence that the same holds true for dependents. and the bill seeks to determine if the Services can begin to track these individuals as well so that we can determine the best course of action to also address this critical problem. Included are several provisions to address issues within the Reserve components. including a requirement that members of the Reserve be provided at least 120 days notification of their deployments. We have been in conflict for more than a decade. and its time that the Services ensure that. when individuals and units are called to deploy or if their orders are canceled. they have adequate time to prepare. I would like to mention. though. Mr. Chairman. that there is one provision which. I think. could adversely impact the morale. wellbeing. good order. and discipline of the force. It is a provision that extends protections to the actions and speech of servicemembers. In essence. this provision protects an individual who engages in hateful or discriminatory speech or action. and a commander may take action only when actual harm occurs. The Acting CHAIR . The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
1130033591,Mr. Speaker. I am very pleased to be here with my colleagues today. I certainly want to thank Mr. OROURKE and Mr. VELA and Mr. GALLEGO for presenting what we all believe is so critical and so important. Its not just about border communities and border cities that acknowledge and benefit from our relationship with the border. and particularly with the Mexican border. it really is the entire States that were representing and far beyond that. Because my colleague represented how much trade is done in other States throughout our countrywe know its important to national securitywe also know its important to our economic interest. because that trade fuels our economy. it stimulates our competitiveness. and it also reflects our cultural values. Those things are critically important. and we need to bring those into the discussion as well. You know. we often talk here in Congress about the need to give businesses the certainty that they need. but honestly. look at whats been happening today. The budget standoffs and sequestration are doing just the opposite of what our businesses really need. In fact. Congress inability to pass legislation is jeopardizing our greatest opportunity right now. which is economic growth. and that is our commerce along our borders. Six million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico. Shall I say that again? Six million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico. Last year. imports from Mexico accounted for more than half of our two nations total trade. which is about $278 billion. Sometimes we can differ slightly on those numbers. but thats about what it is. That trade relies on modern infrastructure. it relies on roads. and it relies on ports of entry that can accommodate the enormous volume of goods coming through every single day. But whats the reality today? Well. the reality is that our ports of entry are in various states of disarray because of underfunding for improvement and modernization projects. Our ports do not have the capacity to meet this demand. meaning that often people have to wait up to at least 212 hours during the day of commerce and trucks up to 6. You know. theres an app out there that tells users how long of a wait to expect. In San Diego. in the district. wait times on Sundays at the San Ysidro Port of Entry can reach 3 to 4 hours. and now and then it can even exceed that. The other day. I was up early getting ready to board a plane to come into Washington from San Diego. and even at about 5:30 in the morning. at the ports of entry. the wait was about 1 hour and 45 minutes. And you know what? They were celebrating the fact that it was only that long. You have to come down to the border to see this. I think for folks who dont live on a border like we have in San Ysidro in San Diego. you cant even imagine how many cars are assembling there. Its pretty spectacular. And you know what? It shouldnt be this way. and it doesnt have to be this way. No modern economy can operate under those conditions. No modern economy devotes just $50 million to fund infrastructure projects for ports of entry for our entire Nation. Think about that: $50 million for all of our ports of entry. What we should be doing is viewing our ports of entry and our borders as assets to our Nation. But instead. chronic underfunding has led to wait times that cost our country every day in total productivity loss and tax revenue. Its tremendous. Wait times translate to $7.2 billion in output loss and cost us upwards of 62.000 jobs62.000 jobspeople who could be working if we could make our ports of entry more efficient. Well. we do have some good news. Congress has already authorized infrastructure improvements at the Nations ports of entry. including critical phases at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego. We know thats the busiest land crossing in the world. So thats the good news that Congress has authorized that. Whats the bad news? The bad news is that Congress has refused to provide the funding necessary to break ground on those two additional phases. And you know what? Thats just not consistent for what we talk about as needing a border security bill for this Nation. The fact that that is so underfunded and chaotic. by any means. suggests that we dont really think that we need to do the right thing when it comes to border security. So lets place the need where it belongs. It belongs on infrastructure. and it belongs in trying to figure out what is it thats going to make a difference for this country. Well. certainly funding that border security will help on the border for ports of entry. If there is one thing that this body should be able to do. that we should be able to come together on. it should be a smart investment that businesses want and workers need. I can assure you. thats what they want and businesses need. So I urge my colleagues to get to work on a budget that supports our Nations ports and our engines of economic growth and place the need for border security where it belongs. We know that it will help create the economic engines that we need for our future. Thank you so much to my colleagues. I appreciate your bringing us together for this.
1130048918,Mr. Speaker. Im very pleased to have an opportunity to join with my colleague from Arizona. Congresswoman SINEMA. to talk about the issue of veteran suicide today and to do it from a personal perspective here. as well. Daniel Somers. as the Congresswoman noted. was a talented young man. a decorated war hero. and a proud soldier. He asked for help. He did. He reached out to the VA in hopes of being admitted to their suicide prevention unit. but he was informed at that time that there was no inpatient availability. no appointments that he could get right away. We now know that Daniel took his life just a few days later. His case was brought home to me because his parents. Jean and Howard Somers. live in my former district and actually were friends of mine and friends of people that I knew. When I first heard the story. I was taken. as anybody would be. by their grief. by what had happened. and the fact that we just cannot let that happen again. I think they asked the question that we all ask: How could a young man like that fall through the cracks? How was it that people did not respond to him? How can we make a promise to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan when we cannot guarantee placement in a suicide prevention treatment center? One thing I think that we all learn from this is that we have to listen to our constituents. What I have found to be so rewarding is that parents with this kind of grief can work through that and use their sons words to become strong advocates for what is needed in the system. Having served on the Personnel Committee. I know it was very important to me to work through this issue for a number years as we know of the many causes of suicide among those who have served in the military. We know that. in fact. the major reasons are not necessarily combat stress. Recent reports have shown us that financial hardship and relationship strife are major causes of suicide among the military. It points out to us how critically important this discussion of mental health is in our country. Sometimes I feel like weve arrived a bit and we plan. I know agencies throughout our country and throughout the VA plan so hard so that these kinds of tragedies do not occur. but they do occur. no matter how hard the effort is. We have got to redouble those efforts. we have got to listen. and we have got to encourage our families to do what they can and what they think is right. I actually think that one of the reasons that the Somers family has become such strong advocates is because people did respond to them. They didnt push them aside and say. Well. this is a terrible story. and were sad that it happened. Were not sure we can do anything about it. We can do something about it. and we will. I thank my colleague for bringing this forward. and I thank the Somers family. as well.
1130056663,Madam Speaker. throughout my political career. I have always tried to work with my colleaguesno matter the partyto get things done for my constituents in San Diego. This week. however. it is hard to point to anything we did to help the American people. As we move past this episode. commentators will inevitably try to decide who looked strong. and who looked weak. who is up in the polls and who is down. who blinked and who stood firm. But Mr. Speaker we need to move past such talk. Because make no mistake. there were no winners this week. Only losers. Thousands of hard working American families who rely on government aid programs. federal employees who were furloughed. and kids just hoping to visit a national park all were hurt this week for no real reason at all. In fact. in my city of San Diego alone. it is estimated we lost $7 million a week during the shutdown. $7 million. Imagine the investments in our schools. roads. and small businesses that we could have made with that money. Madam Speaker we cant keep hurting ourselves. We have many important things to do to put Americans back to work and strengthen the middle class to be playing these sorts of games. The American economy is on the road to recovery. but we keep getting in its way. as we barely avert one manmade disaster after another. For once. lets bring stability to the markets. rather than continually manufacturing uncertainty. In the next few weeks we will have an opportunity to come together and once and for all. put these battles behind us. We understand that agreeing on a budget will not be easy. But that doesnt mean we should stop talking and wait until the last minute to figure out what to do. Instead. lets start working today on finding a balanced approach to solving our budget problems. We can do this. but only if we stop playing games and get to work as soon as possible. Madam Speaker. Americans are sick and tired of watching the show we put on this week. and I am sick and tired of being a part of it. Most of all. I am sick and tired that people here in the Majority think they can routinely use my friends and neighbors back home in San Diego as pawns in some larger political game. Lets agree to never again embrace such a reckless approach to governing that does nothing but cause needless pain to the American people. Lets agree to never again make up problems. when we have actual ones to solve. Lets agree to discuss our differences rather than resent each other for them. Thats what American democracy is all about. thats what it has always been about.
1130065840,I thank Congresswoman SPEIER for having this Special Order today because the focus on NIHyou know. for so many families. it actually comes down to care for their loved one. That is what they know can happen as a result of proper granting at appropriate levels for the NIH. Simply put. it is really vital to the Nations health. Without NIH funding. we will not see the breakthroughs that we have seen in the past. NIH funding has led to cures. It has led to treatments and preventions for truly some of the most horrific diseases of our day afflicting everyone. You know. diseases dont pick and choose between infants and seniors. lower. middle and. we might say. upper class. They dont distinguish. It is kind of equal opportunity for all. and that is why they have to be targeted. I have been a consistent coleader of the annual NIH appropriations letter. requesting that the House appropriate full funding for the NIH. and the return to full funding is absolutely essential. NIH is unique in its function. We know that we have an active private sector in our country. That is wonderful. And we certainly see that in my community of San Diego. and my colleague Congressman PETERS talked about this earlier. But the private sector simply does not have the ability to replace public investment in the NIH. They dont have it. That kind of basic research in science has to come from the United States Government. That is where it has always come from. It has come from there when we even look at the advancements that we have had in technology. And it certainly makes a difference when we think about what we are doing and what our friends. our allies around the world. and even some who are not allies. are doing in this area. So we have got to be competitive. It doesnt make any sense not to be. We know that the NIH conducts and funds research that is just too expensivetoo expensive and too risky for private industry to undertake a loan. and it has led us to major advancements in the understanding of diseases like Alzheimers. cancer. and Parkinsons. The research coming out of and the grants coming from NIH are a huge driver of our biotechnology industry. and that. in turn. contributes heavily to our economy. Particularly in San Diego. we see that every single day because that is where the hundreds of jobs. goodpaying jobs that allow people to really reach their potential and be purposeful about their work. that is where that comes from. NIH funding keeps researchers and graduate students employed doing what they do best. investigating answers to our most complex medical mysteries: cancer. premature birth. heart disease. and so on. I have had these young scientists in my office talking about the fact that they may not stay with the field. a field that they love. because they cant get the grants. As we cut back. only the most experienced scientists get those grants. and they are good. But our young people may be even better. but we have got to give them a chance. We have got to give them a chance to move forward and do that. More than 80 percent of the NIH budget goes to over 300.000 research personnel at more than 2.500 universities and research institutions throughout the United States. So that is affecting a lot more than California. It is affecting our colleagues around the country. and maybe they dont even realize what an impact that has. In San Diego. we are fortunate. We have got a lot of researchers. a lot of scientists working hard. and they received $1.13 billion in NIH funding in 2012. It has sparked major breakthroughs. brings jobs to the region. and creates potential breakthroughs for millions around the country. So we are doing our part. but. tragically. the sequestration requires NIH to cut 5 percent. or $1.55 billion. of its fiscal year 2013 budget. NIH must apply the cut evenly across the board. the way things are today. That is why we have to change that. I hope we will be able to do that. NIH must apply the cut evenly across all programs. projects. and activities which are primarily NIH institutes and centers. This means that every area of medical research will be affected by that. Every area. Not just the few that maybe we think dont need the help. but every area. This is an irrational. backwardsthinking policy that will harm millions of Americanscurrent patients and future onesand cost us millions in economic output. As a result of the sequester and the slashing of NIH funding. already approximately 640 fewer competitive research project grants will be issued from what we have already done. approximately 750 fewer new patients admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. no increase in stipends for National Research Service Award recipients in 2013. and a delay in medical progress. You know. these medical breakthroughs that we have that benefit many of our patients. many of our constituentsand I know I have friends who have been the beneficiaries of some of those breakthroughsthey just dont happen overnight. In almost all instances. those discoveries result from years of incremental research to understand how diseases start and progress. Even after the cause and the potential drug target of disease is discovered. it takes an average of 13 years and $1 billion to develop a treatment for that target. And what is difficult is that we know that a lot of people are waiting for some of those clinical trials because you have to be careful how that is done. and that takes time. It takes enough patience. enough people willing to take that risk so that we can see what happens over time. That is so important. And when we start breaking this up. the whole process doesnt work. Cuts to research are delaying progress in medical breakthroughs. including development of better cancer drugs that zero in on a tumor with fewer side effects. research on a universal flu vaccine that could fight every strain of influenza without even needing a yearly shot. and the prevention of debilitating chronic conditions that are costly to society and delay development of more effective treatments for common and rare diseases affecting millions of Americans. And. as I mentioned earlier. we lose the promising. accomplished scientists and researchers who are leaving the industry because of the loss or inability to get grants. We see that faculty at top universities across the country are reporting cutting labor spending by 7 percent and operating with skeleton staffs. severely limiting job opportunities for new researchers. Over 50 percent of scientists surveyed by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology said they had a colleague who has lost his job or expects to soon. Some of the scientists are not coming back. They are going elsewhere. They are going to those areas where we are competing because they can take a more stable position outside of the research sector here in the United States. Do we want that? I dont think so. Quite simply. we are inflicting decades of damage with the sequester policy that we have. and I hope that that is going to change. It is not rational to do that. It is cruel. It is backwards. It is insanity. Lets join together and undowhat we can agree on in a bipartisan basisa foolish policy with an untold number of victims from every State and every city and town in this country. Let us work together to restore NIH funding immediately. I thank my colleague.
1130068056,Mr. Speaker. I certainly want to thank my colleague. Congresswoman LEE. for this opportunity and for. really. the privilege of working with her for so many years. Today. the 50th anniversary of the war on poverty. reminds us all that more work must be done. And if I could relate on a personal level. I dont believe that I would have had an opportunity to continue my education without having been about to further that at the time of the war on poverty. As someone who wanted to go into social work. it certainly was an opportunity for me to do that and to make a difference in that area. One of the most important steps that we can take is to make preK available to all American children. Today. only 69 percent of American 4yearolds are enrolled in early childhood education programsonly 69 percent. You might be surprised to learn that that troubling statistic places us near the bottomnear the bottomin terms of access among our advanced country OECD peers. in the bottom. In our global economy. that means many American children start behind least when they can afford to. They just cannot make it beyond that. The stakes to address this issue today have never been higher. Over the last decade. we have learned that early childhood education makes a big difference. We have learned that the achievement gap begins before our kids even reach kindergarten. and we have learned that quality preK leads to better life outcomes in school. in careers. and in personal health. The research. indeed. shows that children who attend preschool are more likely to graduate high school. earn higher pay. and live more productive lives. Sadly. we are just not putting these lessons of the war on poverty when we began to address these issues. we are not putting these lessons into action. The argument for universal preK is not just a lofty moral imperative. That sounds good. No. It is good science and it is good economics. By some estimates. the return on investment is nearly seven to one. And that is why most economists agree that preK is a great investment. it is not just another expense. I know that parents throughout San Diego and across our country just want to give their kids the very best start in life. and we should be working together to make that happen. to make sure all our kids get a real chance to succeed. And that. Mr. Speaker. would be one gigantic step to elevate our children out of poverty.
1130093010,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Mr. WILSON and the committee staff for working in a bipartisan manner to develop this bill. The Buck McKeon NDAA continues the committees focus on sexual assault and includes such provisions as requiring the judicial panel to assess the use of mental health records by the defense in preliminary hearings and to compare this with the civilian use of mental health records in criminal proceedings. clarifying that the service academies. including the Coast Guard Academy. are subject to the same sexual harassment and assault requirements. requiring an inspector general review of the separation records of servicemembers who made unrestricted reports and determining whether such separation was in retaliation for filing said report. requiring performance appraisals of a commanding officer to include whether a command climate has been established in which allegations of sexual assault are properly managed and victims feel free to report. and requiring the Secretary of Defense to modify rule 404 of the Military Rules of Evidence to clarify that general military character of an accused is not admissible. except in cases where the military character of the accused is relevant to the offense being charged. Mr. Chairman. oversight of sexual assault in the military remains a priority of the committee. and we will continue to identify gaps that need to be addressed and to enable the Department of Defense to reduce these numbers. We all want to get to the same placesafe working conditions and a harassment -free. sexual assaultfree environment for all. and there are different views of how to get there. but the bill. as it is now. gives us the opportunity to create a military where change can and must occur. On other personnel matters. our bill does not include the proposed legislative changes to the commissary system. housing allowances. and the health care modifications requested by the Department of Defense. As a result of that. the Department will need to address the $1.5 billion savings it already took in its fiscal year 2015 budget. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
1130123751,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Carl Levin and Howard ""Buck"" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. As the ranking member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee. I am pleased that this bill includes a number of provisions that continue our commitment to our Armed Forces. I certainly want to thank Chairman JOE WILSON for working with me in a bipartisan manner to support our servicemembers and their families. I would also recognize and thank our retiring chairman. BUCK MCKEON. and. of course. ADAM SMITH. the ranking member. for their leadership. I am pleased that the final agreement continues the committees focus on sexual assault. These provisions include requiring the judicial panel to assess the impact of using mental health records by the defense in preliminary hearings and a comparison between the civilian use of mental health records in civilian criminal proceedings. requiring the Secretary of Defense to consider the victims of sexual assaults preference regarding whether the offense should be prosecuted by courtmartial or in a civilian court. and requiring performance appraisals of a commanding officer to include whether the officer has established a command climate in which allegations of sexual assault are properly managed and victims feel free to report a sexual assault without fear of retaliation. Mr. Speaker. the agreement also includes several health care provisions that continue to improve the mental health of the force. Although the agreement includes a modest. onetime change to the TRICARE pharmacy copay rates and a decrease by 1 percent in the housing allowance. it does not include the full savings proposed by the Department of Defense. As a result. the Department will need to address the savings it already took in the fiscal year 2015 budget. As Mr. SMITH has pointed out. the discussion on compensation that led to this agreement is a beginning to the conversations we must have. As we look to the next Congress. I hope that the results of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission due in February 2015 will inform this important discussion. We all know these are difficult times. particularly with full sequestration ahead in FY16. Ignoring the issue will only lead the Department to take significant cuts to endstrength and readiness. These difficult decisions will need to be made in order to sustain our allvolunteer force."

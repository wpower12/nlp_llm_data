1130012078,"Mr. President. I want all of our Members to understand that the second amendment we will be voting on tonight is the Ryan budget. Now. there seems to be some resistance among my Republican colleagues in bringing up the House Republican budget for a vote. and it is pretty easy to see why that is. Last years Republican budget was. in fact. soundly rejected by the American people in the election. Since then. it continues to be very clear the American people prefer a balanced and fair approach that puts our economy and our middle class firstnot an extreme. irresponsible approach. Unfortunately. House Republicans put forward a budget last week that doubles down on the rejected ideology that the American people spoke about. They have a new talking point about their same old budget. They now claim their budget would eliminate the deficit in 2023. House Budget Committee Chairman PAUL RYAN has even said it does not really matter how their budget eliminates the deficit. Americans across our country who will feel the impact of the choices we make in the coming weeks and months believe that it does matter. So while some of my Republican colleagues would probably prefer not to hear about it. I think that the impact of the House Republican budget is a crucial part of this debate. and we owe it to the American people to put our opinions on the record. We have come a long way. but there are still far too many Americans today who are unemployed or underemployed. which is why our Senate budgets first priority is boosting our economic recovery. Speaker BOEHNER has actually agreed with President Obama that our debt does not present ""an immediate crisis."" So you might think the House budget would phase in cuts responsibly so we can protect our fragile recovery. Instead. the House Republican budget would do serious damage to job creation and job growth. and it doubles down on the harmful cuts from sequestration. which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates will lower employment by 750.000 jobs this year alone and slow economic growth. The House Republican budget will weaken our economy in the long term as well. As any business owner will tell you. in tight times. the last thing you want to do is cut investments that help make you stronger. Well. that is what the House Republican budget does. It cuts investments in education. so our students and workers are less prepared for the jobs of the future. It would undermine our ability to upgrade our roads and bridges and highways and ports even though our national infrastructure just got a Dplus from the American Society of Civil Engineers. And the House budget would greatly reduce our ability to support research and development. making it so much harder for us to maintain the innovative edge that helps us attract new industries and new businesses to the United States. Americans want to see a budget that puts the middle class first and asks the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to do their fair share too as we work toward deficit reduction. So our Senate budget locks in tax cuts for the middle class while closing loopholes and cutting wasteful spending in the Tax Code. Our budget uses that new revenue from the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations for deficit reduction and for investments that support our economy and strengthen our middle class. The House Republican budget. which we will vote on tonight. does the opposite. According to the Tax Policy Center. the tax plan in the House Republican budget would cost nearly $5.7 trillion in lost Federal revenue. and the majority of that lost revenue would benefit the wealthiest Americans. Just like past House Republican budgets. it is once again pretty unclear how this budget would pay for all those tax cuts that are skewed toward the wealthiest. But the reality is that to achieve the goals that are laid out in their budget. House Republicans will either have to add to the deficitmeaning their budget might not actually balance. as they claimor they are going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. to keep from increasing the deficit while lowering rateswhich they propose to dothe House budget would have to raise taxes by an average of $3.000 on families making less than $200.000 a year who have children. But in their plan. the wealthiest Americans will see a net tax cut averaging about $245.000. There is no reason middleclass families should have to pay for a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. That is bad for our economy. It is very unfair. That kind of unbalanced approach is what made Americans reject the House Republican budget in the first place. The same is true of Medicare. We just heard Senator STABENOW talk eloquently about the importance of Medicare. Well. the House Republican budget would replace the Medicare guarantee with a voucher. capped at growth levels below projected health care costs. forcing our seniors to pay more and more out of pocket. and ending Medicare as we know it. That is not a solution that our seniors deserve. AARP said. in their critique of the House Republican budget: Removing the Medicare guarantee of affordable health coverage seniors have contributed to through a lifetime of hard work is not the answer. That is not me. that is AARP. The Senate budget offers a much better answer. Let me remind everyone. in our budget we uphold the principleconsistent with SimpsonBowles and all other bipartisan deficit reduction proposalsthat the most vulnerable families should not be asked to bear the burden of deficit reduction. Our budget maintains the safety net that has kept millions of families and children above the poverty line during the recession and strongly supports efforts to help our lowincome students and others. as they try to get back in the job market. House Republicans say their budget balances. Nothing in it sounds like balance to me. I would like to remind my colleagues as this debate continues that unlike what House Republicans have said about how a budget achieves its goals. how it achieves those goals really matters a lot. The American people have rejected this plan. and. understandably. some of my colleagues across the aisle would prefer not to vote on it. Our Senate budget offers a credible. serious approach to a fair and bipartisan agreement. It puts jobs and the economy first and provides a credible. balanced path forward. We are going to have to make some tough choices in the coming weeks and months. and I recognize moving away from the extreme approach in the House Republican budget is going to be a tough choice for many of my Republican colleagues. But I hope. as they consider the effects of the House Republican budget on our economy and on our families throughout the country. and the fact that the House Republican approach has been thoroughly reviewed and rejected by the American people. they will now be willing to come to the table. end the gridlock and dysfunction. and discuss a fair. comprehensive budget deal. Mr. President. I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time."
1130028387,Madam President. a few months ago I met two sisters from my home State. They are Mari and Adriana Barrera. These two sisters were brought here by their parents when Mari was 7 and Adriana was 3 years old. They were raised by a single mother who spoke no English after their father left the family behind. Growing up. their mother. who worked at a local hotel. did whatever she could to support her family. but Mari and Adriana often had to depend on themselves. Unlike other children her age. Mari told me she grew up the moment her father left. She told me about how she scheduled all of her familys doctors appointments and how she translated legal documents. and how. at the age of 13. she started working as a hostess at a local restaurant. and not for money. as most teenagers want for their own indulgences. but to support her family. Mari also told me when she was about to enter high school Adriana had to have life -threatening surgery. and a dream was born within herself. As her sisters life hung in the balance. Mari realized she wanted to become a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon. She wanted to help others the way she watched doctors help her sister that day. and she decided she would commit herself to getting the education and work toward that dream. When I talked to Mari that day a few months ago it was just after she had been forced to drop out of the University of Washington because she could no longer afford it. Living in Seattle. she told me about how she had been unable to find a job to support her studies. Why? Because she lacks a Social Security number. Maris dream. it turns outthe same as for many like herhas been put on hold. It has been put on hold because our immigration system remains broken. All those dreams have been put on hold because for far too long Congress has failed to act. They have been put on hold because. despite the fact that young women such as the Barrera sisters want to contribute to our Nation. our current system wont let them. It is not only stories such as those of the Barrera sisters that point to a system badly in need of reform. I see it everywhere in my State. I see it in rural parts of my State. in cities such as Yakima and Moses Lake. where farmers cant get the seasonal agricultural workers they need to support one of our States largest industries. I see it in big cities such as Seattle and Vancouver and Spokane. where hightech businesses struggle to hire the worlds best and brightest. I see it in neighborhoods throughout my State where families have been ripped apart by a system that forces them to choose between legal immigration and longterm separation from the people they love. I see it along our northern border in Washington State where the need to secure a long. porous border must be balanced with smart enforcement policies that dont use intimidation and fear as a weapon. And I see it in my States LGBT communitya community that badly lacks fairness and equality under todays broken system. But these arent problems that cannot be fixed. Although previous reform efforts have fallen short. this Senate is not incapable of this task. especially now. And that is because todaydue to the changing demographics of our Nation. because of the growing political voice of a new generation of Americans. and because of the energy. determination. and hard work of immigration advocates in my home State and across the Nationwe are at a historic moment of opportunity. For the first time in the history of this debate there is broad bipartisan agreement this system must be fixed and that a bipartisan solution is within reach. No one in this country needs to be reminded it is a rarity here when Senators from different parties and from very different States come together to agree on common solutions to a big issue. So it is truly remarkable that over the course of the past year the bipartisan socalled Gang of 8 has worked to craft this bill that is now before the Senate. The bill we are considering is focused on four bipartisan pillars that have drawn consensus support from Members of Congress and the American people. First of all. this bill includes a path to citizenship. so that with a lot of hard work many of the immigrants living in this country who are dreaming of citizenship can achieve that goal over time. Second. the bill provides employers certainty in a system that has often left them without any answers. Third. this bill will help continue the progress we have made in securing our borders by focusing on the most serious security threats and by utilizing new technology. Finally. this bill helps to reform our legal immigration system so it meets the needs of our families and our Nation going forward. These are all important steps. But this bill is only the beginning of a full. fair. and open public debate over reforming immigration in this country. And while it will be tempting to get caught up in the specifics of one amendment or policy in this debate. we cant forget about the larger questions this bill addresses. because at its heart this is a bill that touches nearly every aspect of American life. from our economy to our security. from our classrooms to our workplaces. It is about what type of country we want to be. what we stand for. and what type of future we all want to build. These are the questions I have actually posed in meetings with advocates and businesses and leaders in meetings all over my State. both in recent weeks and going back many years. Those conversations have stirred a lot of passion. brought new facts to light. and helped me bring the voices of countless advocates to this debate today. They have also helped me to arrive at the core issues I believe are essential to repairing our broken immigration systemthe issues I will fight for as we debate in the weeks to come. Sitting and talking about the aspiring Americans this bill will affect has made clear that protecting families must be a central priority in comprehensive immigration reform. Immigration reform isnt just about a persons status. it is about sons and daughters and mothers and fathers and families who want to live full. productive lives together in this country. We know when workers have their families nearby they are more likely to be satisfied with their job. they are healthier. they work harder. and they contribute to our economy. We know families are the building block of strong communities. Yet under todays broken system. familybased immigration has been pitted against employmentbased immigration. and far too often immigrant families are being forced to choose between the country they love and the ones they love. I firmly believe it is in our longterm national interest to change this approach. For immigration reform to best meet our national ideals we have to keep our focus on keeping our families together. reducing these backlogs. giving women immigrants access to green cards. and reuniting immigrants with their families. Immigration reform must also include a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants residing in this country. Many of our undocumented immigrants have lived in this country for more than a decade. They are our neighbors. our friends. our colleagues. They go to church with us. they pay their taxes. and they follow our laws. But our current system creates a permanent underclass of people that are caught between the law and earning a living. While citizenship has to be earned. it is simply not feasible to deport this entire population or expect them to return to their nation of citizenship. We certainly cant make this pathway contingent on enforcement measures that are unachieveable or unrealistic. I believe the bill before us lays the foundation for a pathway to citizenship that will bring aspiring Americans out from the shadows. Immigration reform must also meet the needs of our changing economy. This need is perhaps best on display in my home State where the diversity of our economy creates diverse immigration needs. Washington is home to some of our Nations largest hightech. aerospace. and composite manufacturing firms. These are businesses that demand a robust employmentbased visa system that attracts the best and brightest from across the world. However. just across the Cascade mountains lie miles and miles of fertile farmlands and orchards that demand a flexible and pragmatic agricultural worker program. I plan to support changes that help meet both of those needs while also working to invest in job opportunities for American workers through the STEM investments that are provided in this bill. We also need a smart and humane system of securing our Nations borders. including my States many land border crossings. But we must balance the necessity of securing our borders and enforcing our laws with the importance of treating everyone with dignity and respect. and that includes ensuring access to due process in our immigration hearings. restrictions on the use of unnecessary restraints on pregnant women. the use of less costly alternatives to detention whenever possible. and humane conditions and strict oversight and reporting requirements at our detention centers. Our strategy for enforcement and border security should focus on keeping Americans safe. fighting violent crime. reducing smuggling. and stopping terrorists. We should always be doing it in a way that upholds our commitment to civil liberties and the rights of every American. Finally. I strongly support efforts to craft a system that will unite families by extending immigration sponsorship privileges for married binational LGBT couples. I was very proud of my home State of Washington when it voted last year for marriage equality. However. my heart breaks because each time a binational LGBT married Washingtonian is split apart because their marriage is not recognized by the Federal Government. it is just not right. The Defense of Marriage Act has long barred equal immigration sponsorship privileges for married binational LGBT couples. While I am hopeful the Supreme Court will strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. I believe we should also move decisively to include these provisions in this bill. These are certainly not the only priorities I will be fighting for in the coming days. In fact. I am hoping to offer some amendments that will help open new doors to education for our DREAMers and that will expand investment in our STEM education. But I also know we will see amendments that will attempt to weaken and defeat this bill altogether. because as we saw in the exhaustive and inclusive committee process. there are those who are simply bent on standing in the way of a bill that Americans want and our economy needsthose who will say or do anything to defeat this bill. But I am confident this is a new day for immigration reform. I am confident of that because more Americans than ever before see the benefits of a modern immigration system that is coupled with the investments that help our families succeed. They see we are stronger when immigrant workers are contributing to our economy. when employers have the resources they need to grow. and when a path to citizenship is available to those who are already here. Too often in this debate it is difficult for some people to understand that the millions of undocumented families in our country are already an important part of our communities. Immigrants work hard. They send their children to schools throughout this country. They pay their taxes. and they help weave the fabric of our society. In all but name they are Americans. When John F. Kennedy was serving in this Chamber. he wrote a book about the fact that America is a nation of immigrants. In it. he wrote: Immigration policy should be generous. it should be fair. it should be flexible. With such a policy we can turn to the world. and to our own past. with clean hands and a clear conscience. Today. those words continue to ring true. It is not only the world we have to turn to. This effort is about living up to our own ideals. It is about. as thenSenator Kennedy said. living up to our own past. Our history has long been that of a beacon of hope for people throughout the world. from those who arrived at Ellis Island to start a new life decades ago to the DREAMers who want to contribute to the country they love today. As we once again take on this very difficult task of reforming our immigration policy. lets make sure our actions reflect our security. our economy. and our future. But lets also never forget the past and the fact that our Nation has long offered generations of immigrants the chance to achieve their dreams. I yield the floor.
1130037424,"Madam President. I thank the Senator from Virginia. There is no one in this body more passionate to do the work to get us to a balanced bipartisan deal. to put the budget deficit and the budget issues behind us. and to get our country back on track than the Senator from Virginia. I know he wants to get to a conference committee as badly as I donot to demand that we only have our position but to work with others to find a bipartisan solution. As he so eloquently stated. it has been more than 100 days now since the Senate did pass a budget. and we have tried now 15 times to take the next step to move to a bipartisan conference with the House. Every time we have asked. we have been blocked by a tea party Republican with the support of the Republican leadership. I understand that for some factions in the Republican Party. ""compromise"" is a dirty word. That may explain why they have offered up excuse after excuse for blocking the regular budget order we are trying to work toward. They refuse to allow a conference before we get to a socalled preconference framework. They demand we put preconditions on what can be discussed or talked about in a bipartisan conference. to claiming that moving to a budget conferencewhich leading Republicans called for just months agowas somehow now not regular order. to most recently claiming we need to look at a 30year budget window before we look at the major problems we have in front of us right now. when we canand mustdo both at the same time. I know there are significant differences between our parties values and our priorities. Some of usDemocrats and Republicansthink this is a reason to come together and try to reach a bipartisan deal in a budget conference now. It has been heartening to hear from Senators MCCAIN and COLLINS and many other Republicans who have chatted with me about why they believe we need to have a formal bipartisan negotiation move on this. Unfortunately. there is a small group of Senators who would prefer to throw up their hands and stall until we reach a crisis. when they think they can get a better deal. Last week. I was home in my State. similar to most Senators. and I talked to a lot of Americans who dont understand that kind of approach. They run their businesses and help their communities and support their families by compromising every single day. They cant afford to wait to reach agreements until the very last minute. because when that happens. they have to deal with the consequences. But that is exactly what my Republican colleagues are doing to thousands of my families in the State of Washington. Because Republicans will not allow us to come to the table. the automatic cuts from sequestration are impacting everything from children who depend on Head Start to our national security. What is more. many of the same colleagues will try to tell you that sequestration is not impacting American families. As the Senator from Virginia just talked about. I can tell you firsthand that the impacts are real. For thousands of families in my home State. these become a reality tomorrow morning. That is because furloughs for the Department of Defense employees begin this weekequivalent to a 20percent pay cut for 650.000 defense workers nationwide. Bases in my home State of Washington are being affected. and the first furlough date at Joint Base LewisMcChord in Washington State is tomorrow. So instead of going to work. thousands of workers in my State will go home. The 9111 call center and the fire department will be understaffed. Airfields are going to be shuttered except for emergencies. The military personnel office is closed. The substance abuse center is closed. The Army Medical Center is going to close clinics. and even the Wounded Care Clinic is going to be understaffed. I am reminded of one worker I met last week. Will Silba. Will is a former marine. an amputee. He works now as a fire inspector. and he told me that because of these furloughs he is going to have to get a second job. He is going to struggle with his mortgage payments. While these furloughs are going to directly impact thousands of people and civilian employees. the leaders at LewisMcChord have made it very clear that the furloughs are going to hurt our soldiers. They are going to limit their access to medical care. They are going to cut back on the family support programs. They are going to make it tougher to find a job when they finish their military careers. Why? Because our colleagues refuse to work together. To me. this is unacceptable. Because some Republicans would like to preserve the harmful cuts from sequestration despite these kinds of impacts. we have a $91 billion gap between the House and the Senate appropriations levels for next year. If we do not resolve that gap. we are headed for another round of uncertainty and brinkmanship. another unnecessary burden on our economic recovery and the millions of Americans who are looking for work every day. Some of my Republican colleagues say they are fine with that. In fact. House Republicans are reported. right now. to be busy working on a debt limit ransom noteright nowand so far that ransom note sounds quite a lot like the Ryan budget. As you know. the budget we did pass here in the Senate was very different. but that is exactly why we have to resolve our differences in conference. That is where we come together in a public fashion and talk about our differences and work out agreements. I believe we have an opportunity. a window of opportunity over the next few weeks to do what Americans across the country have asked us to docompromise and confront these problems before we head back to our home States for the work period in August. We do not have a lot of time. but I am confident that if those of us who can see working together as a responsibility rather than a liability come to the table. we can get a fair bipartisan agreement. By the way. I was very discouraged to hear just this week from some tea party Republicansmany of the same ones who are now blocking us going to conferencewho are already talking now about shutting down the government in order to defund ObamaCare. Not only do they want to push us to a crisis. but they want to do that in order to cut off health care coverage for 25 million people and reopen that doughnut hole we know so much about. causing seniors to pay more for their prescriptions. and end preventive care for seniors. and the list goes on. This is an absurd position. We should not be talking about shutting down the government. I really hope responsible Republicans reject this approach and work with us on real solutions. not more political fights. My colleagues and I are going to continue urging the Senate Republican leadership to end their tea partybacked strategy of manufacturing crises and allow us to do the work we were sent here to do and go to a conference. I urge them to listen not just to Democrats but to many Members of their own party who want to get to a budget conference and allow us to get to work to solve the Nations problems."
1130084557,There are a number of women who are going to be joining me today. They are leaders in this Capitol who are working each and every day. both here and back in their home States. to give more of their constituents a chance to succeed. Today we are here to talk about one small idea that stands to make a huge difference in the lives of our constituents. and for women in particular. and that is the idea that if you are putting in 40 or 50 or 60 hours of work per week you should be able to put food on your table and pay your bills. and you wont be stuck below the poverty line. This idea could change the lives of millions of Americans if Congress simply acted and raised the minimum wage. We need to act now because right now one in four womenone in four womenis making minimum wage today. That is 15 million American women who are making the equivalent of about 2 gallons of gas per hour. Are we prepared to tell them that should be enough to support themselves and their kids? In fact. as I am sure you will hear repeated by others today. nearly twothirds of those who earn minimum wage or less are women. This is coming at a time when more women are now depended upon as the sole income earners in their families. Right now in cities and towns across America there are millions of those women who are getting up at the crack of dawn for work every day. They are stuck living in poverty. They cannot save for a car. much less a house. They cannot pay for school so they can get better skills and a better paying job. They cannot even afford to provide their children with more winter clothes or basic medical care. That is not how it is supposed to work in America. the country where you are told if you work hard and play by the rules you can get ahead. So when we talk about the minimum wage. lets be clear: Raising the minimum wage is about bringing back our middle class. I am proud that in my State of Washington we are taking the lead. In our State our workforce enjoys the highest minimum wage in the country. and I am glad to point out to all of our friends on the other side of the aisle. Washington States economy has not been negatively impacted by our high minimum wage. In fact. our economy has benefited from a high minimum wage. Job growth has continued at a rate above the national average. Payrolls in our restaurants and bars have expanded due to people having more money in their pockets to spend at dinner or a night on the town. and poverty in Washington State has trailed the national level for at least 7 years now. That is why I support making the national minimum wage $10.10 for families from Washington to Wisconsin. from Massachusetts to Minnesota and Hawaii and everywhere inbetween. It is not enough to make you rich. but it is a small raise for millions of families who desperately need it. It is a small raise for moms and dads who need help. We have to do more. Today. twothirds of families rely on income from both parents. but thanks to our outdated Tax Code. a woman thinking about reentering the workforce as a second earner in her family may face higher tax rates than her husband. That is unfair. and it has to change. Last week I introduced the 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act which will help solve that problem by giving struggling twoearner families with children a tax deduction on that second earners income. My hope is that over the coming weeks we can all come together in this Chamber on behalf of millions of American women wholike my own mother when I was growing upare the sole caregiver and breadwinner in their families. I hope our colleagues have gotten a sense of how the current $7.25 an hour translates to a grocery trip for a family of four. shopping for school supplies or even how it impacts peoples daily commutes. That is why we are here todayto give that mom or that dad a fair shot at succeeding in America. I am proud to be joined today by a number of my colleagues in the Senate who are strong women and fighting for women and men in their home States. I yield the floor.
1130091570,"Mr. President. I come to the floor this evening. along with my colleague Senator CANTWELL. to talk about a truly remarkable man from our own State of Washington whom we just lost last week. Billy Frank. Jr.. was many things to many different people. To his family he was a loving husband and father. to the dozens of Native American tribes in Washington State he was a hero and a champion for hardfought treaty rights. and to millions across our State. Billy Frank. Jr.. was a marine who represented what the best of America is all about. fighting for what you believe in and never. ever giving up. I was back in Washington State yesterday for Billys memorial service. and looking around at all the people there whose lives he had touched. I was reminded of what made Billy so special. Billy was the type of person who defined the term ""larger than life."" He was the type of person who had so much personality and so much ability and so much passion and love in his heart that it was very hard to believe it could all be contained in just one person. When Billy believed in something. he didnt just make his argument. he held a fishin. He built a movement. He did raise his voice just to be heard. he banged down the doors in Olympia and here in Washington. DC. until he got what he needed. Most of all. he never flinched in the face of opposition. and he faced plenty of it. from hate and discrimination to being arrested and abused. Over a lifetime that took him from the banks of the Nisqually River to the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court. Billy made sure the rights of Native Americans were protected and honored by the United States of America. He led the fight to ensure tribal rights to Native lands and salmon harvest could never be stolen away and over time he became much more than an advocate. He became in many ways a face of so many Native American communities across this country. Now as we grieve and try to think about how to move forward without this largerthanlife man. I am reminded that while we have lost Billy. so much of his lifes work truly remains with us because all he accomplished and all he achieved. whether it was power and influence or court decisions and new laws. it was never about him. It was always about his community. his tribe. and protecting treaty rights for all Native Americans. Billy was someone who did so much and worked so hard not so he could gain power or wealth but so the people. the land. and the fish he cared so much for would never be brushed aside or forgotten. That is a rare thing. Billys life wasnt a job for one man or one woman. but somehow he pulled it off by himself. So now it is going to take everyone who knew him to fill his shoes together and fight with the tribes that call Washington State home. I wish to conclude by quoting something Billy once said: I dont believe in magic. I believe in the sun and the stars. the water. the tides. the floods. the owls. the hawks flying. the river running. the wind talking. They are measurements. They tell us how healthy things are. They tell us because we and they are the same. and that is what I believe in. Those who listen to the world that sustains them can hear the message brought forth by the salmon. That is Billy and we will miss him. I yield the floor."
1130098814,Mr. President. I come to the floor today to say that this compromise is really an excellent example of what Congress can do when we work together to put our veterans first and work toward substantive solutions to the challenges they face. Passing this legislation this afternoon is a critical step toward addressing some of the immediate accountability and transparency concerns that are plaguing the VA and fixing its deepseated structural and cultural challenges. Each new report seems to paint a more serious and more disturbing picture of the VAs systemwide failure to provide timely access to care for our Nations heroes. I am especially concerned by the number of facilities that serve Washington State veterans that have been flagged for further review and investigation. The VA has promised to get to the bottom of this. and I expect them to do so immediately. However. these new reports are not only consistent with what I hear so often from veterans and VA employees but also with what the inspector general and GAO have been reporting on for more than a decade. These are not new problems. and Congress must continue to take action on them while addressing the inevitable issues that will be uncovered as ongoing investigations and reviews are completed. I expect this Chamber to come together. as the House did yesterdaytwice. in factto move this bill forward so we can work on our differences with the House and send this legislation to the Presidents desk as soon as possible. As we all know. there are serious problems at the VA that will not be solved through legislation alone or by simply replacing the Secretary. However. I am very hopeful these steps that are in this legislation will spark longoverdue changefrom the top downin order to ensure that our veterans are given the care and support they expect and deserve. So I wanted to come today to commend the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Vermont for their commitment to bipartisanship and putting the needs of our veterans first. This is an important compromise. and I urge our colleagues to continue the bipartisan collaboration that made this bill possible. Lets get it passed and in place so these reforms can begin to get started. And then we must keep working to address the management. resource. and personnel shortcomings that we all know exist at the VA. I yield the floor.
1130103241,I want to thank our chairman and ranking member. Senator HARKIN and Senator ALEXANDER. for their tremendous work and backing us as we worked through this process. I again thank my partner. Senator ISAKSON. who was so diligent and true to his word and worked through every issue with us. I want to thank him for that. I also will take a minute this afternoon to extend a sincere thank you to all of the staff who worked so hard to help put this bill together. worked through its challenges. and got us to this point today where we have passed it in the Senate.

Bill Knudsen. education policy advisor. and HELP Committee staff director and chief of staff David Cleary. We also benefited from the expertise of the Congressional Research Service. I thank David Bradley. Benjamin Collins. and Adrienne FernandesAlcantara. I would be remiss if I did not thank the professionals in the Senate Legislative Counsels office. especially Liz King. Amy Gaynor. Kristin Romero. and Katie Grendon. As you can see. a lot of people worked a very long time to get us where we are. This has been an 11year process. so there have been a lot of staff who worked on various versions of this reauthorization over the years. I cannot name them all. but there are some who deserve recognition as well: Gerri Fiala. Bill Kamela. Beth Buehlmann. Kelly Hastings. Pam Smith. David Johns. and Glee Smith. Of course. my thanks to the staff in the House and the administration. of whom there are far too many to mention here. I think that tells all of us that this is a bill that was worked on diligently by many over the years. Who will benefit at the end of the day are our workforce and our employers and our country. I thank again my counterpart Senator ISAKSON for working with me to get this done.
1130110295,"Madam President. I come to the floor today to speak for a few minutes about the absolutely devastating wildfires currently burning through the farms. communities. and public lands of our home State of Washington. As a lifelong resident of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest. I have always been aware of the annual risks and dangers that wildfires pose to our region. Every summer. a combination of rising temperatures. months of dry weather. and our States obvious abundance of forest and fields have resulted in wildfires capable of threatening homes and businesses across our State. Each summer we have worked to become better and better prepared to help protect our communities. But one wildfire burning this year is the single largest we have seen in Washington State. Since last Tuesday. massive wildfires covering hundreds of thousands of acres have ravaged our farm lands. our agricultural areas. our cherished public lands. and. most importantly. communities throughout Chelan County. Okanogan County. and others across eastern Washington. I am talking about a massive wave of flames that has burned an area now four times the size of Seattle. which is our States largest city. Even for those of us who have lived our entire lives with the reality of wildfires. this is unprecedented. So while I am here in what we call ""the other Washington."" today. my heart. my thoughts. and my prayers are in Central and Eastern Washington. Even here on the Senate floor. I cant help but think of the firefighters and first responders and everyone who is neglecting sleep and rest to protect their communities. Most of all. I cant stop thinking about the families who lost their homes and all they own to this horrific disaster. If there is one thing I know about our State. it is that we dont turn away from hard times or hard work. Over the last several weeks I have talked with a number of the local leaders in the communities that are facing these fires. including Sheriff Frank Rogers in Okanogan County. Sheriff Brian Burnett in Chelan County. and Mayor Libby Harrison in the small town of Pateros. where dozens of homes. including hers. have been lost to this fire. Every one of them told me that while their community is facing hard times. nobody is giving up. They have been doing everything they can to protect each and every person in their rural communities. and so far they have been able to do that. I wish to share one story that speaks to what is happening in my home State right now. As I mentioned. this small town of Pateros has been hit very hard. They havent lost any lives. but they have lost more than 100 homes and buildings throughout their community. But one building they did not lose was their school. which has always been to them the central place of their community. and it is now the central staging area as these fires rage on. As in many other small communities. the school in Pateros serves kids in grades K through 12. and last week that fire came within just a few feet of that school. Firefighters and responders were working elsewhere. So the school could easily have burned down. until a local man by the name of Augustine Morales decided to do something about it. He and a friend used hoses on the backs of their own trucks to fight back that fire and save their kids school. Augustine was interviewed by a local TV station and here is what he said: Everything was going through my mind because I have my kids and I have to take care of my kids. and I [was] just thinking . . . if you die. I dont know whats going to happen. So that is what so many people just like Augustine are facing right now in Central and Eastern Washington. and I know they will not be giving up. In addition to our thoughts and our prayers. we have to make sure we are working to have all of the Federal resources they need available. I am thrilled the Senate supplemental funding bill that was released yesterday actually includes $615 million for firefighting efforts in Western Statesmoney I requested along with my colleague Senator CANTWELL and 10 other colleagues. But we know there is a lot more work to be done. We have to get that funding passed through the Senate and the House and to the Presidents desk right away. I am really very pleased that early yesterday morning the President. in fact. made an emergency declaration that is going to help those communities fight these wildfires. I know that I and Senator CANTWELL and all of us are going to be working with our local officials and Federal officials all the way up to the President to make sure those communities get what they need. Thank you. Madam President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."
1130111617,Madam President. before I begin I do want to take a moment to commend the chairmen of the Veterans Affairs Committees in both the House and the Senate for their commitment to reaching a deal that puts our veterans first and gives the VA the tools they need to address immediate challenges. More importantly. I really applaud their work to build and strengthen the VA system in order to continue to deliver the best care for our Nations heroes over the long term. The deal they announced yesterday is a very important step toward addressing a lot of issues that we know exist within the VA system. but it cannot be the final step. As transparency and accountability increase at the VA. so will the investigations and reports of additional concerns. requiring even more action from the VA. from the administration. and from this Congress. However. as Chairman MILLER said yesterday. we cannot legislate good character here in Congress. It is going to be up to the leadership at the Department of Veterans Affairs to truly enact those reforms. So I have come to the floor today in support of the nomination of Robert McDonald. someone I believe has the skills necessary to make these necessary changes as the next VA Secretary. As I told Mr. McDonald last week. he is faced with a truly monumental task. Even as we pass comprehensive legislation to bring significant reforms at the VA to reduce wait times. to improve accountability. there are still many serious challenges the VA must address. Twentytwo veterans still take their own lives each day. Thousands of veterans are alone. coping with sexual assaults. And while the Department has made commendable progress. it will be an uphill battle as we work to eliminate veterans homelessness and the claims backlog. Mr. McDonald will have to grapple with these and many more issuesall on day one. When I met with Mr. McDonald in my office a few weeks ago. he told me he was one of the veterans who was lost in the system during his transition from military life to civilian life. So I trustI trusthe understands what a critical moment this is for the VA and why we must finally fix many of these systemic and cultural challenges. We have all made a promise to those who have signed up to serve. So I encourage my colleagues to support this nomination. I am hopeful the steps we are taking here this week on behalf of our Nations heroes will finally ignite the muchdelayed reforms our veterans have been demanding and they deserve. I yield the floor.

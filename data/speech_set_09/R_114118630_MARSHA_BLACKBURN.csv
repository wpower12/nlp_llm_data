1140004211,"Madam Speaker. we have heard a lot of charges and accusations that were made by some of my colleagues as they have chosen to describe the bill before us today. H.R. 7. so I want to be clear about what the bill before us does do and does accomplish. This bill follows a longstanding principle. as my colleague said. going back to 1976. the principle that the American people and Members from both sides of the aisle in both Chambers of Congress have supported for decades. and that is taxpayer dollars should not be spent on abortions and abortion coverage. The vast majority of my colleagues voted for this exact same principle in countless appropriations bills. including a bill that we passed out of this Chamber last month. Yet today. some Members are fighting the widely shared belief that taxpayer dollars should not be used to take an innocent life. The bill before us today also provides muchneeded transparency regarding which health plans on the exchange pay for abortions. The Obama administration promised to provide Congress and the American people a list of plans in ObamaCare that covered abortion. yet they refused to live up to that promise. They forced Congress to act. And. indeed. the GAO has informed us that 1.036 plans include abortion coverage. There is no excuseno excuseto hide information about abortion coverage from the American people. Madam Speaker. 68 percent. a vast majority of the American people believe there should be no taxpayer money used for abortion and abortion coverage. HHS has forced Congress to act on this issue. The commonsense transparency requirement that is in H.BR. 7 is needed. and it is supported by all Members. So that is what this bill is about. following an established bipartisan principle and providing transparency. I urge my colleagues. each and every one. to vote to protect life. to vote to protect taxpayer dollars. and to promote transparency by rejecting the motion to recommit and supporting the underlying bill. I urge a ""no"" vote on the recommittal. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140018070,Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the recognition and the opportunity to revise and extend my remarks and to address the body of the House. Mr. Speaker. as my colleagues all know. this is the week that the American people will strike that check to the Internal Revenue Service to pay their taxes. Now. what has ended up happening through the years. as this tax that came on our books about 100 years ago and was to be a 1 percent temporary tax. has grown and grown and grown. and it continues to eat a greater share of our incomes. I hear from constituents every single dayevery single dayabout the unfairness and the overreach of the IRS. They are so fed up with this because what they observe is government continues to grow and the bureaucracy continues to grow. and what happens? It just takes away bits and pieces of our freedom every time that bureaucracy expands. That is the reason that this week we in the House have set aside time to make certain that we are addressing those concerns that we hear from our constituents. This is a week where we are going to talk about tax fairness. tax equity. and also about overreach. which comes from a government that refuses to live within its means and continues to take more out of the pockets of hardworking taxpayers who are fighting and working so hard to live within their means. I think there basically is something immoral about taxpayers working so hard to live within their means and sending money to a government that refuses to live within its means. Now. there are some things that we can do to address this issue and things that we ought to be doing. and we are. One is to look at a permanent repeal of the death tax. I am so pleased that Chairman RYAN and Chairman BRADY are bringing these bills forward. The other that I want to talk specifically about for a few minutes is H.R. 622. This is a bill that I am the lead cosponsor on with Congressman KEVIN BRADY and one that is very important to my State of Tennessee. just as it is to the other StatesTexas. Florida. Washington State. Nevadathat dont have a State income tax but that choose to fund their government off of other taxes. sales tax. What this legislation does is to make permanent the ability of citizens. taxpayers in those States to deduct their sales tax. their State and local sales tax from their Federal income tax filing. Now. this is an issue Congressman BRADY and I have been working on since 2003. and that year we were successful in having the ability to deduct that sales tax restored to your State income tax. your Federal income tax filing. That is why you now have lines 5a and 5b on those forms. This is the reason that I became so interested in this issue. When I was a State senator in Tennessee. I led not a 4day or 4week or 4month. but a 4year battle against implementation of a State income tax in my StateA full years. It was quite a fight. The people of the State of Tennessee worked with me to make certain that we would remain State income taxfree. Now. of course. they wanted that State income tax to pay for a health care plan. It had been the test case for HillaryCare. It was known as TennCare. That program of governmentrun health care exceeded the expectations of its budget by not 100 percent. it quadrupled in cost over a 5year period of time. So Tennesseeans learned in 2000. 2001. and 2002 the message and the lesson of what a State income tax would do. how it would take more money out of their pocket. As I came to Congress in 2003. one of the very first things we did was to put attention on restoring this deductibility. It is an important bill. I congratulate Congressman BRADY. Chairman BRADY for his work on it. I thank him for his partnership on the issue. I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 622.
1140019717,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 471. the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015. This critical legislation combats inappropriate use of prescription drugs by bringing greater clarity and transparency to the requirements for safe and secure distribution of these medicines. It accomplishes these goals by clarifying some key terminology in the Controlled Substances Act. This comprehensive approach to the legislation will result in better protections against diversion and abuse of controlled substances. What it does is it provides the DEA with the clarity to collaborate with the very people responsible for ensuring that these medications get to the patients who need them without hurting and harming that distribution chain and while clamping down on diversions and abuse. These collaborations will lead to improved policies to prevent diversion while allowing legitimate patients to have access to the medications they need. Now. like so many components and pieces and bills and parts of legislation. the best example of why this is needed is a story that comes from home. In the case of this bill. we had a constituent who called our office after one of the recent ice storms that we saw in middle Tennessee this winter. It seemed as if these storms would never stop. The ice would come. and then it would not melt. We had a constituent who has a son who has a severe seizure disorder. and he takes three different medicines to control these seizures. Although his medicines are not opioids. two of them are controlled substances. So this mother. taking care of her son. decided she better get herself to the drugstore before the storm hit. and she did just that. to refill his prescriptions. She was anticipating that the prescriptions would run out before the ice melted and she would be able to get to the store. At the drugstore. she was told that she could not refill them because it was too early. She explained the situation. The pharmacist sympathized. but the pharmacist went on to say if the prescription were to be filled early. there would be problems with the DEA and other agencies. The pharmacist was worried that his license might be lost. Our legislation is simply to ensure that patients who have a legitimate need for medications can receive them while we are battling diversion and abuse. which truly is a problem in this country. So. Madam Speaker. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this effort. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140027284,"Mr. Chairman. I find it so interesting that this is called a ""meatax approach."" Yes. I do come regularly to offer these amendments. because I care what happens with our Nation. I care about our future. and I want to make certain that we are on solid financial footing. We have a responsibility to be good stewards of the taxpayers money. It is their money. To say this is mindless and easy. how interesting that is. Go tell all of the Governors from coast to coastDemocrat and Republicanwho use acrosstheboard spending cuts to get budgets in balance. Tell that to mayors who use this same process. The reason it is done is it works. It helps the bureaucracy hold itself accountable. and that is absolutely what we ought to be doing at this point in time. As you can see. cutting is a very emotional issue. Cutting brings forward a lot of emotions. Talking about doing more with less. being resourceful. that is what we should do every single day. In order to be a good steward of the taxpayers money. we should want to do more with less. We should do it in the name of freedom. for freedoms sakefor the sovereignty of this Nation. Illconceived and unrealistic? When is operating by a balanced budget and spending and living within the means the taxpayers have said they are going to have for this Federal Government ever considered illconceived? When would it be considered unrealistic? It is what we ought to be doing. Indeed. if every department did what the legislative branch did of cutting 14 percent. we would be getting close to budget. To say that we are suspending intellect and judgment. do you know that is almost frivolous and almost silly to say. We spend less and should be spending less and should try to continue to spend less and reform this government and hold it accountable to the taxpayer who is footing the bill because. yes. the Nations future depends on it. our national security. yes. depends on it. and respect. it is respecting future generations and the taxpayer to be a wise steward. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140037859,Mr. Speaker. one of the things I hear from my constituents so regularly is: What are you doing about our Nations debt? What are you doing about this outofcontrol budget? From time to time. at our committee. we would hold hearings on an inspector general report and actually look at some waste. This started our office thinking and some of us on the Budget Committee thinking about: How do you begin to quantify that and hold these agencies accountable? As one of my constituents said: You know. it seems that they are always after one of us. a smallbusiness owner. but they never go ask a Federal bureaucrat or a Federal agency to pony up or to pay back money or to be held accountable. In our office. our interns this summer have worked with us on a project to actually begin to quantify this waste and to look at these inspector general reports. Mr. Speaker. this is what we found. Just taking the reports from the 70 agencies that have inspector generals and looking at a 4year period of time. from 2011 to 2014. what we found is this: we could put our finger on $105.7 billion of waste. and that is $105.7 billion of waste. of taxpayer money that is being wasted. It has been identified by the inspector generals office. That works out to about $1.5 billion for each of these 70 agencies. Now. what was of concern to us was the fact that many of these agencies are doing nothing about it. and we found that. when you look at the reports that have been issued. which total 81 different reports. the reports for which a management decision was made during the reporting period was only 30 of those reports. Mr. Speaker. 30 times. management said that they are going to go in and they are going to take an action in response to the recommendations that the inspector general has found. Now. one of the things that we looked at was where these wasteful occurrences continue to happen and who are the repeat offenders when you look at these IG reports. Let me give you some examples. Mr. Speaker. Department of Defense. $38.2 billion that has been identifiedthis is one of the reasons that Republicans are pushing to audit the DOD and hold people accountable for the wasteful spending. Health and Human Services. $10.3 billionwe found that $2 billion went toward the ObamaCare Web site. which still is barely working. Department of Agriculture. $9.2 billion. Social Security Administration. $9.1 billion. Department of Energy. $7.7 billionand by the way. Solyndra. a green energy firm. filed for bankruptcy in September 2011. after they got 536 million taxpayer dollars. The list goes on and on. What we are going to doand I commend Chairman PRICE for pushing forward to hold some hearings with these inspector generals. with these departments. to drill down on the total number of reports and to hold them accountable for not taking an action and looking for ways that we. as Members of Congress. can charge back these agencies for the continued misusenot occasional misuse. not one time misuse. but continued misuse of taxpayer dollars. When you look at the list of these agencies and what they have done. year after year. there are some of these agencies that end up in the top 10 offenders every year2014. Department of Defense. HUD. Health and Human Services. Department of Energy. Social Security. Department of Agriculture. VA. Homeland Security. Department of Education. Department of State. and the Agency for International Development. You can look at 2013. continuing down the list. the top 10 again. Defense. HUD. Energy. Health and Human Services. Railroad Retirement Board. Homeland Security. Agriculture. Social Security Administration. Department of Education. and Department of Staterepeated waste. fraud. and abuse of the taxpayer money. When I came to Congress in January 2003. our freshman class decided our project was going to be rooting out wasteful Washington spending. We continue to be committed to that. and I submit our findings to the body for their review and understanding.
1140042161,"I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for pulling us together. Madam Speaker. when you talk about issues that are womens issues. right now national security is at the top of the heap. As we have talked about soccer moms and Walmart moms and all of these other iterations and descriptions during the years. right now we are looking at a category of security moms because the issue of security is what mothers are talking about. I appreciate so much the gentlewoman from North Carolinas leadership. and we have two other colleagues who have yet to join usMs. RosLEHTINEN from Florida and Mrs. LUMMIS from Wyomingto talk about this issue. Coast to coast. this is what people are talking about. and they sit in disbelief at what this administration is doing. Whether it is Iran or whether it is other foreign policy. our friends and allies look at us. as the gentlewoman from Alabama said. and they ask: ""What are you doing? Where have you been? What are you thinking?"" As we would say in Nashville. ""They have got a thinking problem."" Our enemies look at us and say: ""Asleep at the wheel. This is our opportunity."" That is exactly what Iran is doing. and they are looking at what we are doing to our military. I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for talking about her love for Fort Rucker and the men and women there. I know the gentlewoman probably sits down with those in her district at Fort Rucker. like I do with the families. with the leadership team. with the men and women in uniform at Fort Campbell. which is located in my district. They are terribly concerned. They have a mission to fulfill. and it is despicable that this administration will continue to try to cut and cut and cut our military. cut the numbers. dont give them raises. dont give them all the tools and training. dont give them the Flying Hours Program that they need for redeployment. Guess what. Madam Speaker. Every bit of that affects the effectiveness of our men and women in uniform. The gentlewoman from Alabama will expand on the point of the cuts that are taking place at Fort Rucker and what that means to her constituents."
1140043784,"I thank the gentleman. And I thank the gentleman for his leadership in organizing this hour. Mr. Speaker. we come to the floor tonight as mothers and grandmothers and dads and granddads. and we come with such heavy hearts and with such a burden for what we have found out. for what we have seen. and for what has been made public about Planned Parenthood. I will tell you. Mr. Speaker. that I thought it was very interesting that the head of Planned Parenthood came out this week and said. ""Oh. we think there are more videos to come."" That is because they know they have been caught. and they know they are guilty. and they know what they have done. but no amount of trying to go out and push it to the side is going to push this to the side. That is why our committee. the House Energy and Commerce Committee. is taking up an investigation. We are already working on this. We are pushing forward to get the witnesses before us and to exercise the appropriate oversight that is there for us to do. Planned Parenthood does get Federal taxpayer dollars. The problem is money is fungible. And when you see what has been carried out in these videosin their own words what they describeyou know how destructive that process is. As Mr. WALKER just said. Planned Parenthood conducts over 300.000 abortions a year. They are the Nations largest abortion provider. Their focus is no longer family planning or womens health. It is abortion. What we have found out is that. through this sector of their business that is focused on abortion. they have now moved even further away. and they are into selling body partsharvesting and selling body parts. We have heard the Members speak so eloquently to this. and I know. Mr. Speaker. people can hear the emotion in our voices and in our hearts. because this is a subject you dont think about discussing on the House floor. but it is one that has been left for us to oversee. They talk about procuring these body parts. In their own words. they talk about setting the price. negotiating. dealing with the tissue brokers. These are the most abhorrent and inhumane statements and words and conduct. The conduct and the demeanor of these individuals on those videotapes cannot be denied and the casual nature with which they discussed this. as if it is routine. It is an expected part of their business. That is why we are moving forward to investigate them. That is why we feel funding should be restricted. Over 65 percent of the American people. Mr. Speaker. are against the use of taxpayer funds for abortion. and it is time for us to deal with. to hold accountable. to restrict. and to put some barriers around what has been happening with Planned Parenthood. It is an investigation we will pursue until we know the truth and have every element of truth."
1140051105,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3134. the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of Madam Speaker. we all remember the images of Kermit Gosnell killing babies who were born alive after a botched abortion. We know that those are sickening. and we know that they have renewed the demand for accountability from the American people. That is why we come before you today with H.R. 3134. the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of New documentation of these heinous practices that we have seen in videos. videos that have come out of Planned Parenthood abortion clinics of harvesting the body parts of babies as part of the abortion process. have raised serious questions about the possible systematic and repeated violation of State and Federal laws. H.R. 3134 provides a 1year moratorium. a freezinga freezingon the Federal funding to Planned Parenthood Federation of America and all of its affiliates while investigations are ongoing regarding the practices of the abortion industry. Madam Speaker. most people think that is common sense. If there is reason to investigate. then there is reason to withhold taxpayer dollars during that period of time. Those dollars would be given to other facilities that provide womens health services. The American taxpayer has been very clear for a long time that they do not want taxpayer money spent on abortion. 68 percent of Americans oppose it. What is so interesting to me is that we know that 71 percent of all millennials oppose this. I would remind my colleagues. Madam Speaker. there is no difference between men and women on this. There is bipartisan opposition from men and women to this practice. Additionally. the majority of Americans are opposed to the sale of body parts of babies obtained after abortion. So the discussion today is not about videos or womens health access. We know there are other ways to get that access. It is about our most basic right. It is about the right to life. It is also about doing what the taxpayers sent us to D.C. to do. It is also about continuing the process to protect our most vulnerable citizens. innocent little babies. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140105309,"Mr. Chairman. this amendment would prohibit funds made available by the act from being used to implement. administer. or enforce any of the rules proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking adopted by the FCC on March 31. 2016. That is order FEC 1639. It is intended to regulate ISP consumer privacy obligations. Mr. Chair. there are two problems with the FCCs actions that warrant a delay in the adoption of rules by the agency. First. the FCCs proposed rules are extreme and go well beyond anything they should be doing in this space. and it is a bipartisan concern. In May. Democrats BOBBY RUSH. GENE GREEN. and KURT SCHRADER joined several Republicans in a letter to all of the FCC Commissioners and voiced strong concerns that the FCCs proposed privacy rulemaking ""intends to go well beyond"" the traditional framework that has guarded consumers from data practices of Internet service providers and ""illserves consumers who seek and expect consistency in how their personal data is protected."" The FTC has traditionally been our governments sole Internet privacy regulator. A dual privacy enforcement model will create confusion within the existing Internet ecosystem. The FCC simply doesnt have the requisite technical expertise to regulate privacy. Former FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright testified before the House Judiciary Committee that the FTC has ""unique expertise"" in ""enforcing broadband service providers obligations to protect the privacy and security of consumer data."" The FCCs proposed rule would create economic harm. Former FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright. a GMU economist. recently said that there has been no economic analysis on the rules impact. He said. ""Thats a bad thing. to be clear."" Let me tell you something. The fact that we have an agency that is not studying and working on the economic impact and reviewing what this is going to do to the economy is absolutely unbelievable. especially when you look at the fact that the FCC does not have the authority and expertise to move into privacy. That is the FTCs domain and a place where they work. This new rule has caused the FTC to bring forward two dozen additional questions. the stakeholders have proposed 500 questions. and the rule is a 147page rule. Mr. Chair. I reserve the balance of my time."

1130098554,RODGERS. Mr. Chair. I rise today in strong support of Section 738. a section allowing for the inclusion of white potatoes in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women. Infants and Children (WIC). in the fiscal year 2015 Agriculture Appropriations Act. I commend Chairman ADERHOLT as well as Chairman ROGERS for their work crafting this legislation in a bipartisan manner. Washington State is blessed with an incredibly diverse agriculture industry. providing our nation and the rest of the world with topquality products including asparagus. apples. cherries. peas. lentils. wheatand of coursepotatoes. In fact. Washington State is second in the nation when it comes to potato production. contributing 23 percent of the nations potato crop. Additionally. potatoes are the fourth largest agricultural commodity in Washington. providing jobs for hundreds of people in Eastern Washington and all across the state. To that end. I was pleased to join my colleagues this past January in passing the bipartisan Omnibus spending bill which directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to include in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for WIC a range of fruits and vegetables including nutritious white potatoes. Science has proven that fresh white potatoes are more nutrient dense than many of the vegetables already included in the WIC program and possess a significant amount of vitamin C and potassium. Despite the latest research and the clear intention of Congress. the Administrative has repeatedly fought to exclude white potatoes from the WIC program. Relying on decadesold consumption data cited in a 2005 Institute of Medicine report. the Department of Agriculture has arbitrarily limited this healthy option from the diets of millions of Americans. In fact. the most current science available. the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. recommends greater consumption of starchy vegetables. Mr. Chair. I believe the exclusion of potatoes in the WIC program is both scientifically unfounded and unfair to those Americans seeking a greater variety of healthy food options. I appreciate the work done in this bill to correct this arbitrary restriction and I urge my colleagues to support Section 738 of this bill.
1130115006,"RODGERS. Mr. Chair. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5078. the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014. I commend Chairman SHUSTER and the members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their work on this important legislation. For over forty years. the quality of our nations waters has been managed through a partnership between individual States and the Federal Government. This relationship. established by the Clean Water Act (CWA). recognizes that some waters are more effectively regulated by local stakeholders and state officials than the Federal Government in Washington. DC. This partnership has led to less pollution and cleaner water for Eastern Washington and our nation. Despite decades of success. the Obama Administration has recently proposed a rule that would significantly alter this partnership by increasing Federal oversight of our nations waters. The Administrations proposal would dramatically expand the definition of ""waters of the United States"" under the CWA. potentially placing ditches. drainages. creeks. and even seasonally wet areas under Federal jurisdiction. Additionally. the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an interpretative rule that would increase regulation of our nations farms by narrowing an exemption under the CWA for certain agricultural practices. As such. this proposed interpretative rule will negatively impact farmers and growers in Eastern Washington and throughout the nation. I support the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014 because it seeks to rein in the Administrations overreach into our nations waters. First. this bill prohibits finalization and implementation of the proposed rule expanding Federal regulatory authority over bodies of water currently managed by or jointly with the States. Additionally. this bill prohibits the interpretative rule which expands Federal regulation of our nations agricultural communities. The legislation also requires the EPA and the Corps to engage in a ""federalism consultation"" with State and local governments to help identify which bodies of water should be federally regulated and which should be left to the states. In short. H.R. 5078 restores the FederalState partnership envisioned by Congress when it passed the CWA. I believe regulation of our nations waters must be done in a manner that balances the need to responsibly protect the environment with the economic needs of our communities. To that end. I support H.R. 5078 because it ensures that we can continue to protect our waters without unreasonable and burdensome regulation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5078. the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014."
1130125758,RODGERS. Mr. Speaker. tonight we celebrate my friend and esteemed colleague. Chairman Doc HASTINGS. for his 20 years of dedicated service in the United States House of Representatives. Doc has been a constant source of wisdom. of compassion. of patience. and of leadership for our Chamber. and I know that he will be sorely missed by all who have had the pleasure of working with him. Every day he has represented the people of the TriCities. Yakima. Moses Lake. and all of Central Washington with his tireless commitment. When he first came to Congress in 1995 to represent Washingtons Fourth Congressional District. he came with his sleeves rolled up ready to get things done. He didnt come to seek the spotlight. He came to Congress to help the people of Central Washington in every way he could. to make their lives better. and that is exactly what he has done. In his years on Capitol Hill. Doc has been a humble leader and a masterful legislator. It was in 1974 when Doc entered politics. He was elected Franklin County Republican Party Chair and served Franklin County with his tremendous work ethic and attention to detail. As a proud early supporter of Ronald Reagan. it wasnt long before Doc was chosen as a delegate for Ronald Reagan at the 1976 Republican National Convention. He went on to serve as a faithful representative in the State legislature from 1979 to 1987. He first ran for Congress in 1992 and came up a little short. but that didnt deter him. In 1994 he ran again. and he soon came to our Nations Capitol after winning a race against thenincumbent and current Governor of Washington State. Jay Inslee. That year. Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. and Doc embodied that spirit of hard work and determination. In all the years I have known him. I have marveled at his ability to get things done without seeking the limelight. When I came to Congress. I quickly learned that when Doc spoke. people listened. It is because of him that BPA rate increases in the Pacific Northwest were limited. It is because of him that those back home didnt see their electric rates skyrocket. And it is because of his relationships. both here and at home. that we have been able to build upon the foundation of our economy. It is because of him that we have been able to move forward on so many effective economic solutions for the Pacific Northwest. Doc has been a steady hand and an instrumental leader in his chairmanship of the House Committee on Natural Resources. and on the House Committee on Ethics. In his recent work as Natural Resources Chairman. Doc worked to reform the 24year old Endangered Species Act in an effort to improve species recovery. reduce ESArelated litigation. and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently and wisely. He worked to make the law work for both species and for people. His focus has always been on making laws more efficient and effective to help people. and this is no exception. Regardless of the issue. whether it is energy. healthy forests. protecting our dams. irrigation. agriculture. or manufacturing. Doc has championed countless policies that have driven our economy in the Pacific Northwest. Serving as founder and chairman of the House Nuclear Cleanup Caucus. Doc has tirelessly educated his colleagues about cleaning up nuclear waste created by World War II and Cold Warera nuclear weapon production programs. The program includes waste at Hanford site. which is the worlds largest and most complex environmental cleanup effort. and it is Doc who has worked to ensure that cleanups move forward safely and efficiently. and it is Doc that helped the TriCities community prepare for the postcleanup era. It goes without saying that those in Washington State are better because of Does service. As cochair of the bipartisan Congressional Northwest Energy Caucus. Doc has worked to promote cooperation on issues that impact the continued availability of lowcost hydropower. He gave us the opportunity to work together on policies like protecting the Northwests important source of renewable hydropower. addressing the future of the Columbia River Treaty. protecting the Snake River Dams. and integrating wind energy into BPAs transmission systems. Under Docs guidance. we have had the opportunity to collaborate to promote a strong future for our regional power system. As a master of all things rules. he knows the rules better than just about anyone. The Speaker could always turn to him when he needed a steady hand who understood the rules. What I admire most about Doc is that he is kind and selfless. He is as kind and selfless as he is brilliant. When our son. Cole. was born. and after he was diagnosed with Down syndrome. Doc was the one that welcomed us back and introduced Cole to the world on the House floor. He is an invaluable legislator. an unmatched mentor. and a man I am proud to call my friend. Docs family has always come first. His wife. Claire. has been his partner. by his side 20 years now in service. and I can say from experience it is not easy to have your family on one coast when you are on the other. Claire and the entire Hastings family have always been a source of continued commitment and unconditional love. and I know Doc feels so blessed to have had that unwavering support. I thank the Hastings family for sharing with America a tremendous and invaluable leader. His heart has always been with his children and grandchildren. and I know that he will be glad to be able to spend some more time with them. Doc has filled the role of dean of the Washington delegation. and he is going to be missed. While this great leader will no longer walk the Halls of Congress every day. this institution is better and stronger for having had him here. Doc will be missed every day. but his legacy will live on in Congress and. of course. all across Eastern Washington. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky . chairman of our Appropriation Committee.

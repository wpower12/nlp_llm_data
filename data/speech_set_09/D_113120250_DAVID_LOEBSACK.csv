1130028896,Mr. Chair. I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment. The current moratorium on the use of A76 competitions was put in place under President Bush after the Department of Defense Inspector General and the nonpartisan GAO found significant flaws with the A76 process. including that the costs of A76 competitions often exceeded the estimated savings. Those flaws have not been fixed. Put simplylifting the moratorium on A76 would not save taxpayer dollars. would not be in the best interest of our military readiness. and is not supported by the Department of Defense. In fact. the Department of Defense opposes lifting this moratorium until the significant problems with these competitions are addressed. Moreover. as cochair of the Depot Caucus. I appreciate that this amendment would exempt publicprivate partnerships but Im deeply concerned that lifting the A76 moratorium and putting back into place a severely flawed system would do significant damage to our organic industrial base. including our arsenals and depots. at a time when it is critical that we maintain these facilities capabilities to equip our troops. I proudly represent Rock Island Arsenal. where thousands of highly skilled people work every day to equip our troops. Our organic industrial base has time and again shown their critical importance to our men and women in uniform. When our troops on the ground needed improved armor on their vehicles. it was Rock Island Arsenal that was able to rapidly produce and field that lifesaving armor to protect our troops. As a military parent. I am thankful that the workforce at Rock Island Arsenal and in organic industrial base facilities across our country is there to equip our men and women in uniform. In addition. I strongly support publicprivate partnerships between our organic industrial base and the private sector because they leverage the skills and capabilities from both sectors to equip our troops and improve our national security readiness while benefiting the taxpayer and supporting the highly skilled workforce at our arsenals and depots. Conversely. A76 competitions do not produce best value for the Department of Defense and our service men and women. The deeply flawed A76 process should not be reinstated and I strongly oppose lifting the moratorium. For these reasons. I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to join me in voting against it. The Acting CHAIR . The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia
1130081016,Mr. Speaker. this is the final amendment to the bill. which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If adopted. the bill will immediately proceed to final passage. as amended. I regularly meet with seniors across Iowa. and far too often I hear that many of them are struggling to make ends meet. just as I am sure that many of my colleagues hear from their seniors as well. They tell me how much they rely on Medicare in order to stay healthy and just to afford their daily necessities. Mr. Speaker. our seniors did not get us into this fiscal mess that we are in today. and I think we have to keep that in mind. It is unfair to punish them for Washingtons irresponsible behavior. That is why we have got to protect Medicare for seniors who have worked a lifetime to pay into it. This also is an issue I will say that is personal to me. I grew up in a family that struggled to make ends meet. I often talked about how I grew up in poverty. My mom was a single parent who struggled with mental illness. and literally. in the fourth grade. we landed at the doorstep of my maternal grandmother. My grandmother often relied on Social Security survivor benefits to care for me and my siblings. Without the promise of health care through Medicare. she would not have been able to afford to put food on the table. No seniorand I think all of us in this body can agreeno senior should have to choose between paying their bills or paying for their medication. Mr. Speaker. replacing Medicare with a voucher system would end the guarantee of health care and financial security for our seniors as well. Vouchers would force seniors to pay more and more of their health care costs out of pocket. In these tough economic times. we need to find ways to be more efficient while maintaining quality care. I know that seniors dont want a voucher that forces them to buy insurance that may not meet their needs because they tell me that every single time I meet with them. They do not want their health care to be subject to the whims of insurance companies looking to make a profit when they. those seniors. get sick. They dont want higher costs. and they certainly dont want reduced benefits. They want to keep Medicare the way it is. a guaranteed benefit they can count on when they need it. They paid into it. and they deserve it. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this final amendment to the bill. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130093703,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise this evening in strong opposition to this amendment. Put simply. this amendment would cost taxpayers. It would not be in the best interests of our military readiness. and it is not supported by the Department of Defense. This amendment is extreme in its intention. It overrides every other law on the books in terms of the management of the national defense workload by prohibiting the transfer of the workload from the private sector to the public sector. For years now. Congress and the DOD have established statutes. regulations. and policies for determining the correct mix of the workforce between military contractor and civilian. As the cochair of the Depot and Arsenal Caucus. I am deeply concerned that this amendment would put back into place a severely flawed system that would do significant damage to our organic industrial base. including to our arsenals and depots. at a time when it is critical that we maintain these facilities capabilities to equip our troops. I proudly represent the Rock Island Arsenal. where thousands of highly skilled people work every day to equip our troops. Our organic industrial base has. time and again. shown its critical importance to our men and women in uniform. When our troops on the ground needed improved armor on their vehicles. it was the Rock Island Arsenal that was able to rapidly produce and field that lifesaving armor to protect our troops. and as a military parent. I am personally thankful that the workforce at Rock Island Arsenal and organic industrial base facilities across our country are there to equip our men and women in uniform. This amendment would starve our critical organic industrial base. sending it into a death spiral. undermining key elements of our national security infrastructure. and reducing our ability to meet our national security strategy. In addition to the impact on military operations. this amendment would also not produce the best value for the Department of Defense and for our servicemen and servicewomen. Again. it is not wanted by our Nations military leaders. For these reasons. I oppose this amendment. and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against it. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130124463,"I thank the gentleman from Idaho. Mr. SIMPSON. I didnt know that you did ""Oh. Pretty Woman"" and all these other songs. I cant wait. TOM. to see you back in Iowa. Madam Speaker. it is really an honor for me to be up here tonight to speak for and about TOM LATHAM. When I got elected in 2006. TOM had been here for some time. not a long period of time. but for 12 years. I knew about TOM from what I had read. I didnt know him personally. I was one of those folks who came to Congress with no one expecting me to get here. so I didnt know that many folks in this body certainly before I got elected. When I got elected. one of the first things I did was try to find out as much as I could about TOM LATHAM and meet with TOM LATHAM and work with him on a number of issues because I knew he had a reputation for working across the aisle. I also knew that he was very good friends at the time with Mr. BOEHNER. who subsequently became Speaker of the House. so I knew it was probably in my interest to get to know TOM LATHAM if I wanted to get things done for Iowa. even though Speaker PELOSI took over when I came. My job since I have been here. I believe. has been to work with both sides of the aisle. and TOM LATHAM is a model. as far as I am concerned. for doing exactly that. When I first came. you know. we had a lot of tough issues to deal with here in the U.S. Congress. and one of the things that happened very early on when I first got elected was the issue of the National Guard came up. and I was on Armed Services. A lot of those Guard folks were being deployed multiple times. and it was very. very difficult for their families. A number of us recognized that what we needed to do was build facilities. more facilities. upgrade facilities. get rid of those old National Guard armories and replace them with readiness centers that would be there to train and equip our troops in the event that we had to send them overseas on a mission. which we did many. many times. and Iowans proudly have served over the years. over these many years. in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places. We needed to construct those facilities also for their families. for their spouses. and for their children. So on the Armed Services Committee I did what I could in terms of authorization to make sure that the funds were there. and on the Appropriations Committee. of course. what TOM LATHAM did was make sure that we had the funding to make sure that we built those facilities as well. So we were able to work on that issue together. Then when the floods. the great flood of 2008 hit across Iowa. but mainly across the eastern half of Iowaand it would include a lot of TOM LATHAMs districta lot of it included my district. about half the damage was in my district alone. But I worked with TOM. I worked with STEVE KING. BRUCE BRALEY. and Leonard Boswell. We really did a great job working on a bipartisan basis to make sure that what we needed in Iowa we got. So we worked very hard on that. Then also on veterans issues. When we heard about the scandal in Phoenix. the first thing I did was I contacted TOM LATHAM and said. ""Hey. we need to go to Des Moines together if that is okay with you. I know it is your congressional districtit is not minebut lets go to Des Moines together and talk to the folks there about the Des Moines facility."" I have been to the VA facility in Iowa City in my district many. many times. but I wanted to go to Des Moines. and I wanted to go with TOM. and I knew that he would work together with me on that to make sure that everything is right. and if it isnt right that we fix it. So he was very much open to that. He didnt hesitate for a second. That is the kind of person he is. That has been the kind of legislator he is. even at a timeand in this body we have seen a lot of ugliness over the years. It seems as though our politics in America has just gotten uglier by the day sometimes. and even in the middle of all that. when that has happened. TOM LATHAM has stood tall. he has stood proud as an Iowan. He has got a lot of common sense. like most Iowans do. and he works with the other side because he knows that the job is to get things done. That is what TOM LATHAM does. He has gotten things done. We are going to miss you. TOM. there is no question about that. and I think you know that probably better than we do. We are going to miss you. I know you have heard that from a lot of folks. TOM LATHAM. he is a humble Iowa guy. that is what he is. He has been able to get a tremendous amount done for his district. for my alma mater. Iowa State. before he lost that to Congressman KING. and for any other number of folks in his congressional district over the years. I honor you. I honor Kathy. I am looking forward to seeing you later tonight. and thank you for everything. TOM. Farewell and good luck with whatever you end up doing."

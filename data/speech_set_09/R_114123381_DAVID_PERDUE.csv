1140038224,Mr. President. I rise to speak about the greatest domestic policy train wreck we have seen in our lifetime. a fundamentally flawed law that is holding back our economy and limiting peoples freedom when it comes to choices in health care. Of course. I am talking about the Affordable Care Act. ObamaCare. ObamaCare was the creation of a Democratic supermajority that crammed ObamaCare through Congress without open debate by the American people. In the last 5 years since ObamaCare became law. the American people have not yielded in their strong opposition to ObamaCare. In fact. today. more than a majority of Americans continue to disapprove of this law. and there is no wonder why. When I am back home in Georgia. one of the most frequent and sobering concerns I hear about is the insidious. negative economic impact of this law. The consequences of ObamaCare are hurting Georgians in many ways and millions of Americans. First. the individual mandate is forcing people onto ObamaCare. whether they can afford it or not. Like my wife Bonnie and I. many people have had their insurance plans actually canceled. lost access to their preferred doctors or were forced onto insurance plans that cost more. not less. In Georgia alone. dozens of ObamaCare plans are expected to have doubledigit rate hikes next year. with some peoples plans skyrocketing over 60 percent. That is just unacceptable. Second. ObamaCares employer mandate is causing small businesses to cut back workers hours and. in some cases. businesses have actually stopped hiring completely. Due to the 30hour workweek rule inside ObamaCare. many people are being forced to move from fulltime to parttime work. This is devastating the families already struggling to get from payday to payday. Without a full workweek. many moms and dads are juggling multiple parttime jobs to provide for their families and try to save for the future. Next year. for example. 2.6 million people are in danger of having their hours cut because of ObamaCare. Sixty percent of those individuals are female and over 60 percent are the young. firsttime workers between 18 and 35 years of age. Third. given the growing. aging population. ObamaCare is contributing to a dangerous doctor shortage. The Association of American Medical Colleges is predicting a shortage of as many as 90.000 doctors by 2025. Another survey by the Physicians Foundation found that 81 percent of doctors describe themselves as either overextended or at full capacity. and 44 percent said they planned to cut back on the number of patients they see. retire. work part time or actually close their practice to new patients. Ultimately. ObamaCare is raising costs. not lowering them. cutting workers wages. not growing them. decreasing access. not expanding it. and making it harder on the middle class. not easier. While the sentiment of the Supreme Court on ObamaCare is still to be determined. one thing is crystal clear: ObamaCare is hurting people and our economy. It must be fully repealed and replaced. We have to stop allowing Washington to dictate what is best for individuals and their families. Putting bureaucrats between patients and their doctors. between patients and their insurance provider. and between doctors and the insurance providers is what created this catastrophe in the first place. ObamaCare was wrong from the start. We have seen the growing unintended consequences of this flawed law in its implementation over the last 5 years. We now have the power to change course and create a better health care system for all Americans. I remain committed to using every tool at our disposal to repeal ObamaCare. Achieving consensus on repealing ObamaCare with a patientbased alternative will require diligence and robust debate. but I am hopeful we can achieve that goal. I urge my colleagues to continue to work not just to fight against ObamaCare but to fight to protect the millions of people who are hurt by it every day. We can create a health care system that offers the American people affordability. transportability. and yes. insurability. We can create commonsense health care policy that lowers costs and doesnt harm the economy like ObamaCare. And yes. we can create a bipartisan solution that helps people by putting patients first and getting Washington out of the way. It wont be easy. but is achievable. It must be achievable. For the sake of our kids and grandkids we must do this. We must get rid of ObamaCare once and for all. I yield the floor.
1140051343,Madam President. I rise today to talk about why I am here. and really why all of us are here. We are here to represent the people of our great States. We are here to do the peoples business and to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. We just finished an ongoing debate about how Congress can direct and guide foreign policy in the United States. In doing so. we have seen the dangerous consequences of partisan politics right here on the Senate floor and how that can affect this process. Just last week. 42 of my Democratic colleagues supported President Obamas dangerous nuclear deal with Iran while still having serious concerns about its global ramifications. Now we must refocus our attention on solving our fiscal crisis and tackling our skyrocketing national debt. State governments across the country set both funding levels and clear priorities for their States each year based on the needs of their people and their local communities. Washington has been distracted from this for far too long. Balancing the budget and efficiently allocating resources is what Washington has not done well for the last several years. Too many people here are preoccupied by politics of the day when getting our fiscal house in order should always be the top priority. In other words. Washington has stopped listening to the American people. Well. Iand a few of us. including the Presiding Officeram indeed listening. The American people told us what they wanted in November of last year when the Presiding Officer and I were elected. Georgians tell me repeatedlyeven nowwhat they want. They want less government. They want less spending. They want us to push back against President Obamas outofcontrol spending and Executive overreaches that are failing the working men and women of America. The bottom line is they want us to deal with this debt crisis. Earlier this year. the Senate Budget Committee took a great first step by passing a balanced budget for the first time since 2001. This budget outlined our conservative principles and spending limits. This budget spends $7 trillion less than the Presidents budget over the next 10 years. What it doesnt do is reduce the debt today or deal with the over $100 trillion of future unfunded liabilities coming at us like a freight train. It does balance in 10 years. which is quite an achievement given what we had to work with. but more can and must be done right now. So I am going to continue my focus on cutting wasteful spending and reducing Federal expenditures with the goal of developing a longterm plan to pay down this outofcontrol massive $18 trillion of Federal debt. In the last 6 years. we spent $211/2 trillion funding our Federal Government. That is so large that it is hard to spend. What I cant understand is of that $211/2 trillion. $8 trillion was borrowed. We simply cannot continue going down this road. While one side wants tax increases. the other side wants spending cuts. In my experience. neither alone will solve the equation in its entirety. Growing our economy is the only real solution. Again. the budget is just the first step. We must put our conservative principles into action and work through the regular appropriations process to determine how we responsibly allocate Federal funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee has put forward 12 appropriations bills that adhere to the Republican budget and that reflect the priorities of the American people. Overall. these bills are under the Budget Control Act caps that were put in place by Congress in 2011 to control spending. More importantly. they better prioritize taxpayer dollars to meet the goals of the American people. For example. these appropriation bills decrease spending on ObamaCare and increase spending for border security. They end the EPAs waters of the United States rule and stop the Obama administrations onerous greenhouse gas regulations. They also prohibit the NLRB from changing the rules of the game. such as the ambush election rule and changing the jointemployer relationship. in order to prevent negative impacts to American workers and business. They subject the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. or CFPB. to congressional oversight and eliminate hundreds of duplicative programs that have outlived their original mission. The list goes on and on. The fiscal year ends on September 30. That is only a few days from now. We must move forward and debate these 12 appropriations bills that reflect Georgia values and fulfill the promises we all made to represent the American people. While we have already seen our Democratic colleagues block such debate on these important bills. I hope we can immediately restart this critical process and return to regular order. Certainly. a full and robust debate on all of these bills is necessary to ensure that our Federal Government continues to function without overspending. Now. I can tell my colleagues there are some things I would like to change in these bills. but they ought to be debated. It ought to be debated in the open and not blocked by more partisan gridlock that we see here every day. I hope the majority leader will continue to bring these bills to the floor and I hope the objections of my Democratic colleagues will finally end. and lets get to an open and honest debate. Georgians sent me to the Senate to fight for them. and that is what I intend to do. This is just a start. I will not and I cannot stand by while Senate Democrats continue to block the Senate from doing the peoples work as they did every day when they were in charge. Madam President. I also wish to speak for just a moment on a bill that is going to come up this week focusing on the unborn. I wish to say a few words today in support of the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act of which I am a proud cosponsor in the Senate. Simply put. this legislation protects unborn babies from unimaginable pain. Every child is a blessing. and I am incredibly fortunate that God has blessed my wife and me with two great boys and three grandsons. I will never forget the day we found out we were going to have our first child. It was life changing. When the doctor gave us the exciting news. we were overjoyed. but. at the same time. we were a bit overwhelmed. We were young. like most parents. We were going to become parents. We were going to have a baby. There is a difference. Like every expectant mother. my wife was glowing. She may not have felt great and maybe didnt think she was glowing. but I assure my colleagues. she was. I will never forget seeing our baby on the ultrasound for the first time. or feeling him kick. And. the day my first son was born. holding him for the very first time was one of the most incredible moments of my life. When the doctor told us we were going to have our second child. I was concerned we couldnt possibly love this second child as much as we did the first. but. wow. how I was wrong. Later in life. my wife and I have been blessed with three grandsons who are all great. There is no greater love than that of a parent. although it can be rivaled by that of a grandparent. Believe me. my three grandchildren know how to tug at my heartstrings. My children and grandchildren are why I am here in the Senate. fighting for them and others like them to have a better future. for my fellow Georgians. for them. and for all Americans. We live in the most compassionate country in the world. We send food. clothing. and medicine all over the world to help save underprivileged children and families who are struggling to find the basic things they need to survive. It is extremely troubling. therefore. that our countrys compassion for life is absent here at home. Only seven countries in the world allow parents to abort a baby after 5 monthsonly seven. That is not a list America should aspire to be a part of. According to the Congressional Budget Office. over 10.000 unborn babies 20 weeks or older are killed in America every year. Imagine that for a moment. Each year. more than 10.000 lives. who feel and react to pain. have their lives brutally taken from them. In my view. this is a national disgrace. It is absolutely unconscionable. I cannot believe protecting life. especially that of the unborn. is an actual subject of debate. One would think this would be an issue of unity. but debate on this important legislation could not have come at a more urgent time. Recent gruesome videos describe the harvesting and selling of fetal organs and remind our Nation just how barbaric the abortion industry has become. As a parent. and now a grandparent. I find it difficult to imagine that something so horrific can happen in a country as compassionate as America. Our Nation must promote a culture that values all life. We must protect the innocent and the most vulnerable among us. especially the unborn. We can protect unborn babies from unimaginable pain. We can protect life. That is why I support this legislation. That is why I cosponsored it. I urge my colleagues to take it very seriously. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1140063923,"Mr. President. I rise today to speak about our persistent global security crisis. but I also want to connect how our national debt crisis affects that. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims of these tragic events of the last 3 weeks. This week the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hosted the French Ambassador to the United States. In that meeting we shared that our thoughts and prayers are with them and with the people of France. But. more than that. we stand in solidarity with them against these evil forces that manifested themselves in the streets of Paris this past week. The horrific ISIS attacks in Pariskilling more than 130 and injuring more than 350 men. women. and some childrenserve as a chilling reminder of the threat we continue to face from international terrorism every day. Earlier this week. Russia confirmed that it was indeed a terrorist bomb that took down a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula. killing all 224 people onboard. Just last night. we saw two aircraftthank God. under a false alarmgrounded because of fear of a terrorist attack. In addition. ISIS claimed responsibility for twin suicide attacks in Beirut last week. killing 43 more people. This makes three international attacks in three short weeks. ISIS continues to be a persistent threat to the West and to the security and stability of the Middle East. Unfortunately. as they have already said several times. these attacks only confirm what ISIS has in mind for the future. ISIS has been very clear about their intention to bring their version of terrorism to our own backyard. here in America. Indeed. ISIS even threatened Parisstyled attacks on our Nations Capital in a recent video this week. Earlier this week. CIA Director John Brennan said he would not consider the Paris attacks a oneoff event. Director Brennan went on to say: Its clear to me that ISIL has an external agenda. that they are determined to carry out these types of attacks. I would anticipate that this is not the only operation that ISIL has in the pipeline. In light of the latest attacks by ISISbeyond Iraq and SyriaI could not disagree more with our President. who says that his policies are indeed containing ISIS. The President and his administration continue to underestimate this threat. He even called them the JV team not too long ago. Despite the fact that ISIS has demonstrated its ability to perpetrate largescale attacks beyond the borders of its socalled Caliphate. President Obama refuses to change his failed strategy. Beyond the fault of the President. however. fault lies here in Congress as well. Washington is entirely too often focused on the crisis of the day instead of getting at the true underlying problems and solving them directly. It shouldnt take a tragedy like this for Washington to pay attention. Again. the latest terrorist attacks only underscore that we are facing a global security crisis of increasing magnitude. and this is inextricably linked to our own national debt crisis. As a matter of fact. the biggest threat to our global security is still our Nations own Federal debt. This is as true today as it was when Admiral Mullen. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. in 2012. said the same thing. In the past 6 years. Washington has spent $21.5 trillion running the Federal Government. That is so large. I have a hard time even grasping how significant that is. But what I can understand is this: Of that $21.5 trillion we spent running the Federal Government. we have actually borrowed $8 trillion of that $21.5 trillion. With over $100 trillion of future unfunded liabilities. on top of the $18.5 trillion we have already built up. this is about $1 million for every household in America. Every family in America today shares in this responsibility of about $1 million per family. We are so far past the tipping point. it may be at a point of being unmanageable. If interest rates alone were at their 30year average of 5.5 percent. we would already be paying over $1 trillion in interest. That is unmanageable. That is twice what we spend on our defense investment. and it is twice what we spend on our discretionary nondefense investment. It is unmanageable. and we are well past that tipping point. Yet. Washingtons own dysfunction and gridlock is keeping us from completing the budget process. as I speak today. and passing appropriations bills in the Senate. I might even argue. we may have seen the last truly votedupon and approved appropriations in the Senate because of the abuses of the rules that we have seen both sides play in recent years. Shockingly. in the last 40 years. only 4 times has the budget process worked the way it was designed. as it was written into law in For example. this year we have tried to get onto the defense appropriations bill. That means we are trying to take the appropriations bill that would fund the defense so we can defend Americans abroad and we can defend our interests here at home against threats like ISIS. and we are being blocked from even getting that billwhich passed with a vast majority of votes in committeefrom getting to the floor for a vote. No less than three times have the people on the other side of the aisle blocked it from going to the floor for debate. amendment process. and a vote. and three times the Democrats have voted against allowing us to get the defense appropriations bill on the floor. thus making it a political football. It is something I dont understand. not being of the political process here. We have recent attacks from ISIS. and yet we cant even find consensus here in this body to fund our Defense Department. William Few. the very first Senator from Georgia. in whose seat I serve today. would absolutely be appalled. He would remind us of the United States Constitution. There are only 6 reasons why 13 colonies. of which Georgia was one. came together to form this miracle called the United States. One of those was to ""provide for the common defense."" And here we are. through dysfunction and partisan politics. not acting appropriately to fund the ability to provide for the common defense. I hope we can learn from recent events and get serious about tackling this debt problem so we can use that resource to fund our strong foreign policy. We need a strong foreign policy to fight these threats abroad. But to have a strong foreign policy. we have to have a strong military. We proved that in the 1980s. when we brought down the Soviet Union with the strength of our economy and the power of our ideas. We are at risk today because of our own intransigence and national debt. To have a strong military. as we proved. we have to have a strong economy. That is in jeopardy because of this growing debt crisis. To confront this global debt crisis. we have to get serious today. We have to break through. We have to get shoulder to shoulder and defend our country. which means we have to do the hard work on the floor of the Senate and pass the funding so we can defend ourselves against these new threats. Now is the time to solve this debt crisis so we can lead as a country again. to deal with this global security crisis. and to provide for the safety of Americans. wherever they are in the world. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140068546,"Mr. President. I have spoken at length about how our debt crisis and our global crisis are interconnected. Before I speak today. though. I want to thank the Senator from Texas for his leadership this year. as we did get the Senate back to regular order. I know we have much to do. but I appreciate his leadership as whip and as a fellow colleague. Thank you. Today I rise to speak about how this overlap between our debt crisis and our global security crisis impacts the future of a vital Air Force asset: the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. or JSTARS. as they call it. I visited with Team JSTARS to hear about their critical role. We made a visit. We talked about how their role affects our national security and our national defense and countering the global security crisis we face. I have also seen in Iraq and Afghanistan firsthand how this platform is absolutely vital to protect our forces on the ground in harms way. The global security crisis facing our Nation continues to grow. First. we face our traditional rivalsChina and Russiaas they become ever more aggressive. The persistent threat of nuclear proliferation is now exaggerated and increasing every day with Irans efforts and. of course. we see what is going on in North Korea as well. Finally. we face threats from radical jihadist terror groups. not just in the Middle East but here at home. unfortunatelyand not just from ISIS. AQAP. Boko Haram. and alShabaab. to mention a few. are all thinking about how to do harm here in our homeland. As a result. we know that the need for American leadership in the world isnt going to go away any time soon. Team JSTARS plays a critical role in our response to these threats. JSTARS is an Air Force platform that provides critical intelligence. surveillance. and reconnaissance. or ISR. and ground targeting capabilities in service to all branches of our military. Over the past 25 years. they have flown over 125.000 combat hours in 5 different combatant commands. As a matter of fact. they have flown every day since 9111. The ""J"" in JSTARS stands for ""joint."" Team JSTARS is a blended unit. The Air Force. Army. and National Guardsmen who work on the team. eat. sleep. and deploy together. These men and women leave for days. weeks. and sometimes they deploy for months to protect our men in uniform around the world. Not only are they a joint mission with the Army. but JSTARS also does several mission sets. JSTARS does command and control as well as providing intelligence. surveillance. and reconnaissance. From stakeout to shootout. JSTARS is capable of supporting all missions in all phases. with full spectrum capability from low to high intensity conflict. In the words of General Kelly. SOUTHCOMs commander. JSTARS is quite unique. ""a true forcemultiplier. working seamlessly with both the DOD and interagency assets. generating impressive results in our assetaustere environment."" What makes JSTARS unique from other intelligence. surveillance. and reconnaissance platforms is that on each JSTARS plane. we have unique manpower at the tactical edge to talk to our servicemembers on the ground with 22 radios. 7 data links. 3 Internets. and a secure telephone system. These are things we cannot take for granted. Our men and women on the ground talk about this incessantly. As I saw it in Iraq and Afghanistan. we could not fulfill our mission without this type of capability in the air. overseeing our men and women every day. As we see threats around us from an increasingly aggressive Russia and China. the threat of electronic warfare is also a growing concern. If satellite communication radios are targetedif these systems are degraded by the enemy in any wayJSTARS can in turn provide the same critical capability in theater. This is a redundant capability we cannot do without. This platform has proven itself to be invaluable and indispensable to our Armed Forcesnot just in the Air Force and Army but in every servicethe Marines. the Navy. the Coast Guard. and even in some counterdrug missions. In the Pacific. JSTARS has been a key part of the Asia rebalance. helping to maintain stability and assure allies by providing vital insight to maritime forces as they push back against an expansive China. In fact. as China continues to challenge freedom of navigation and asserts itself in the AsiaPacific region. PACOM is asking for more and more JSTARS presence at a very time when their capability is declining. Also in Asia. U.S. Forces Korea commander General Scaparrotti calls JSTARS ""very important to us"" as he deters an unpredictable North Korea. Here in this atmosphere. JSTARS has flown in support of homeland defense. doing drug interdiction missions. General John Kelly. the SOUTHCOM commander. said: ""JSTARS is especially important. providing a detailed maritime surveillance capability that is unsurpassed."" To give you a comparison. a single JSTARS sortiea single planecan cover the same search area as 10 maritime patrol aircraft sorties. But the future of this platform is in jeopardy. As threats against our Nation have evolved. JSTARS has too. But there are only 16 of these planes covering our needs worldwide over the last 25 years. We have relied on JSTARS for 25 years to protect our men and women whom we put in harms wayto protect them while other people are trying to do them harm. Unfortunately. in the last 25 years. these planes are beginning to wear out. They are reaching the end of their service life. These planes have been in service since the early 90s. But even then. these planes werent new when the Air Force acquired them. Each plane on average had over 50.000 hours when we bought them. The average age of the fleet is 47 years. If you look at just one example in the JSTARS fleet. there is one aircraft that had 16 different owners or lessors over that time before it became a JSTARS. including Pakistani International Airlines and Afghan Airlines. I think it is very ironic that today that very plane flies oversight missions over those two countries. As these planes near the end of their service life. they are spending more and more time in depot maintenance. More maintains is more costly. Dramatically increased maintenance time is threatening aircraft availability and mission readiness. This in turn impacts the number of JSTARS that can be put into mission at any one time and be out in the combatant commands while doing their job. while day by day the demand from combatant commanders for JSTARS grows. What is more concerning is that as JSTARS near the end of their service life. as you can see on this chart. there is a gap. If we do nothing. we will have a gap of 10 years. The best we could do starting today is to shorten that gap to 4 years. This is a gap we cannot allow to happen. This chart shows the declining availability of the current fleet down to zero by 2023. It also shows that under the current planpending DOD approval and fundingthe replacement fleet does not even come online until 2023. meaning we will have a 10year gap. They dont get back to full strength until around 2027again. the 10year gap. Due to the increased maintenance requirements of this aging fleet. JSTARS is already at a point where we only have about half the fleet available to fly at any point in time. Even if we extend the service life of JSTARS and accelerate the replacement. we can only narrow the gap to 4 years. This is unacceptable. I have talked about the planes. Let me talk about the men and women who man those planes. who service those planes. who keep those planes in the air. These are talented professionals. I have met with them. They are dedicated professionals. protecting our soldiers on the ground. They are committed to this mission. but they have to have our help. The men and women on the ground in Iraq. Afghanistan. and around the world deserve our help. But when it happens to have a gap like this. our irresponsibility as a Congress and as military leadership shows up. We cannot allow this to happen. Recapitalization for the JSTARS fleet needs to happen. and it needs to happen right now. As these aircraft age. depot maintenance is not only more costly but also keeps these aircraft. which are in high demand for every combatant commander. from fulfilling their mission fully and putting our soldiers on the ground in mortal danger. This is precisely where we see the debt crisis and global security crisis intersect. In the last 6 years. I have spoken about this before. but we borrowed 40 percent of what we have spent as a Federal Government. This puts our ability to support a strong foreign policy backed up by a strong military in jeopardy. As Admiral Mullen. former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. once said. the greatest threat to our national security is our own national debt."
1140072715,Mr. President. tonight President Obama will deliver his final State of the Union Address. a closing argument for his Presidency. This President. who promised change. will attempt to point to his administrations accomplishments. as many Presidents have done in the past. However. this will prove to be difficult because Georgians and Americans have seen change but in the wrong direction. When President Obama took the White House. he promised fiscal responsibility. but right now he is on track to more than double the debt in his tenure. He promised to work together in a bipartisan way. but he used the Democratic supermajority in those first 2 years to force through ObamaCare and DoddFrank on the American people. He promised to bring us together. but he has served to divide us as a country. He promised to focus on defeating terrorism. but he created a power vacuum in the Middle East for others who wish to do us harm. There is no denying it. under this Presidents failed leadership. the American people have had a tough several years. Today more Americans have fallen into poverty under this Presidency. Too many individuals and families have seen their health care premiums and their deductibles rise to points where they can no longer afford them. Our national debt is almost $19 trillion. which is well past any reasonable tipping point. and we have a global security crisis on our hands that makes the world possibly more dangerous than at any point in my lifetime. These are all symptoms of the Presidents failed economic policies as well as a lack of leadership in foreign policy. Even by his own accord. the President has saddled our country with an irresponsible amount of debt which he described in the past as unpatriotic. Before he took office. thenSenator Barack Obama reviewed President Bushs tenure in office saying: The way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children. driving up our national debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidentsnumber 43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome. so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back $30.000 for every man. woman. and child. Thats irresponsible. Its unpatriotic. Those are the words of this President. Barack Hussein Obama. Lets be clear. under this President. our national debt has ballooned to almost $19 trillion from $10 trillion. That means that President Obama has added almost $9 trillion already and is on track to more than double this debt before he is through. Before President Obama leaves office. he will have nearly added as much debt as all of the other Presidents before him. This is even more outrageous when you factor in how much revenue or tax dollars the Federal Government has collected. In 2015. we collected over $3.4 trillion in taxes for our Federal Government. This is more than any year in our history. Washington does not have a revenue problem. it has a spending problem. and it is focused on the wrong priorities. Equally concerning. this massive debt isnt interest free. If interest rates were to rise to the 30year average of only 5.5 percent. the interest on this debt would amount to over $1 trillion each year. That is more than twice what we spent on all nonmilitary discretionary spending. It is more than twice what we spend on our military and defending our country. It is totally out of control and this is unmanageable. In reality. this debt crisis will only get worse because this President and Washington have not tackled the governments largest expensemandatory spending programs such as Social Security and Medicare. This debt crisis does not only present a fiscal problem. it is inextricably linked to the global security concerns we are seeing today. In order to have a strong foreign policy. we have to have a strong military. but to have a strong military we have to have a vibrant and growing strong economy. There is no secret that down through history the countries that have had the strongest militaries. and therefore the most secure foreign policy. are those that had the most vibrant economies of their day. Under this Presidents foreign policy decisions. he has created a power vacuum and put the country in a much weaker position. Today our enemies dont fear us and our allies dont trust us. Just three decades ago we brought down the Soviet Union with the power of our ideas and the strength of our economy. Look at the world today. Over the past 7 years. we have seen the rise of a global security crisis that is unrivaled in my lifetime. We have seen the rise of traditional rivals such as China and Russia grow more aggressive. We have seen North Korea and Iran actually collaborate on nuclear proliferation. We have seen Syria cross red lines and terrorism fill power vacuums in the Middle East and around the world. Last week North Korea claimed to have successfully completed its fourth nuclear weapons test with a much more powerful weapon than they possessed before. This is a sobering and stark reminder of the true consequences our country faces when our President shows weakness in the face of these radical regimes. And not only have we witnessed weaknesses. but we have also seen this President naively trust a country like Iran. the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism today. Since President Obama announced his dangerous Iran deal in July despite strong bipartisan opposition. Iran has actively accelerated its ballistic missile program and continued financial support for terrorism in the region. in violation of the very sanction we just heard on this floor. Iran has fired rockets near U.S. warships. fomented unrest in Yemen. taken more Americans hostages. refused to release an American passenger who has been held for 3 years. convicted an American journalist of spying. banned American products from being sold in Iran. and renewed its support for Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists. From the beginning. President Obama didnt listen to military advice and prematurely pulled our troops out of Iraq. creating another power vacuum. ISIS. of course. we now know. grew into that power vacuum and sprouted influence not only in the Middle East but in Africa and Asia as well. Last November. this President told the American people in a news interview: We have contained them. They have not gained ground in Iraq. And in Syria if theyll come in. theyll leave. But you dont see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain. Well. we now know ISIS is not being contained in their ability to wage war against the West and will stop at nothing to deliver terrorism even to the shores of America. The Presidents plan has failed. it is plain and simple. and we sit here today with no strategy to defeat ISIS. The world needs to see decisive action from the United States. not empty rhetoric that cant be backed up. We need a new leader who takes every threat of any size seriously. Moving forward. nothing can go unchecked and unmet without relentless American resolve. No matter how we measure it. President Obamas economic and foreign policies have indeed failed. Time and again. he has refused to change course when his policies didnt work. when they didnt help the American people. whom he claims to champion. Instead. this President has created the fourth arm of governmentthe regulatorsand they are sucking the very life out of our free enterprise system today. Now. fewer people are working. wages are stagnant. incomes arent growing. the debt is soaring. and the world is much more dangerous than it was 8 years ago. But tonight we will also hear from this President about his optimism for the future. Well. I get that. I share that optimism but only because I believe we can do better. We can do a lot better. We can tackle our national debt crisis. We can save Social Security and Medicare. We can defeat terrorism once and for all. We cannot do it without bold leadership. however. We cannot do it without a sense of urgency or responsibility. We cannot do it unless the political class in this townWashington. DCfinally puts national interests in front of selfinterests. We cannot do it without the will and support of the American people. I believe in America. Georgians believe in America. Americans believe in America. Americans have always risen to the crisis of the day. and I believe we will rise to this crisis. But Washington needs to really listen to the American people. focus on solutions they support. and unite our Nation to make sure our best days are indeed ahead of us. We owe it to our children and our childrens children. and the time to move is right now. The time for rhetoric has ended. We need to face up to the two crises we have today: the global security crisis and our own debt crisis. which are interwoven together. Thank you. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1140082832,"Madam President. regarding the vacancy on the Supreme Court. many of our colleagues in the minority party have said the same things we are saying today. Lets stop kidding each other. This kind of political showmanshipand. yes. indeed. hypocrisyis exactly what makes everyone in my home State absolutely apoplectic with Washington. The last time I addressed the Supreme Court vacancy on the Senate floor. I urged my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to let the nominations process get bogged down in partisan politicsthat is not what this should be aboutnot to let this process turn into political theater because that is exactly what has happened far too often in this body ever since the Bork nomination way back in The organized campaign of vilification and character attacks surrounding Judge Borks nomination was so unprecedented and so extreme that it took the creation of a new word. ""to Bork."" to describe what had happened. The process for nominating Justices to the Supreme Court has been thoroughly politicized ever since. That politicization has done great damage not only to the Court but to this body. the U.S. Senate. It has expanded beyond just Supreme Court nominees and now affects so many of our nominees for circuit judgeships as well. That is what happened in 2013. when thenMajority Leader REID broke a tradition almost as old as the Senate itself by invoking the nuclear option and breaking the Senates filibuster rule to stack various circuit courts. I dont think I need to remind any of my colleagues that when the Democrats were in the minority. there was no shortage of protests heard in this room about how sacred an institution the filibuster was. Keep in mind that the nuclear option was invoked after the Senate confirmed the Presidents first nominee to the DC Circuit by a unanimous 97to0 vote. It was an act of raw political power. the nuclear option. We heard yesterday that the President has named his nominee to the Supreme Court. but lets be clear. any previous confirmation or record as a judge or professional qualifications are not the issue for any nominee. What is at stake is the integrity of the process. not the person. It is the principle. not the individual. because our judicial nominees to the Supreme Court. the circuits. and the district courts deserve better than to be used as pawns in any political fight. and that is exactly what would happen if the Senate were to consider any nominee in the middle of this political season. I am a new Member to this institution. but this has been the view of my colleagues in both parties who have served in the Senate far longer than I have. This was their view no matter who the nominee was. This was their view even when there wasnt a vacancy to fill. The former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Vice President BIDEN. recognized this in 1992. when he said: Once the political season is underway. and it is. action on a Supreme Court nomination must beI want to emphasize that ""must""must be put off until after the election campaign is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is central to the process. Otherwise. it seems to me. we will be in deep trouble as an institution. I agree. The Vice President correctly saw that when we inject a nomination into a contentious electionyear atmosphere. we do a disservice not only to the nominee but to the institution of the United States Senate itself. It is my view that enough institutional damage has already been done to the Senate through these politicized nominations. I wish to say a little about the text of the Constitution. We hear both sides talk about this. but lets see it in detail. I have heard so many of my Democratic colleagues claim that the Senate has an obligation to schedule hearings and hold a vote on this nominee. We have all read article II. section 2. of the Constitution. Every Member of this body knows the Constitution says nothing about hearings or votes on judicial nominees. It is simply not there. Senators of both parties have always understood this and have said so for years. regardless of who was in the majority. In 2005. Minority Leader REID said: ""Nowhere in the Constitution does it say the Senate has a duty to give Presidential appointees a vote."" Before that. in 2002. the former chief judge of the DC Circuit. Abner Mikva. who was a Carter appointee. said: ""The Senate should not act on any Supreme Court vacancies that might occur until after the next presidential election."" The senior Senator from Nevada and Judge Mikva were right then. and Chairman GRASSLEY and my Republican colleagues are right now. Despite many of them previously making the exact same points we are today. my Democratic colleagues are continuing this diatribe of telling us to do our job. I would respectfully say to my Democratic colleagues today. we are doing our job. Our job as Senators is to decide how to responsibly exercise the powers of advice and consent delegated to us under our Constitution. The responsibile course of action herea course of action endorsed by both Democrats and Republicans for decadesis to refrain from initiating the nomination process in the midst of an electionyear political fight. The responsible course of action is to avoid the political theater this nomination would become. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140089030,"Mr. President. I rise today to speak about why all of us are here. The primary role of Congress is to responsibly fund the Federal Government. To do that. we must set clear national priorities that we can financially support. All too often. the process of setting. and then sticking to these national priorities has become a purely political exercise. not a function of governing. It is the No. 1 complaint I hear when I travel back to my home State of Georgia. Coming from the business world. I clearly see two interlocking crises we face as a country. First. we have a global security crisis. The world may be more dangerous right now than at any point in my lifetime. Interlocked with that is our national debt crisis that threatens the ability we have to defend our country today. As we begin the appropriations process. lets take an honest look at what we are appropriating for. One of our top national priorities is to provide for the national defense. It is one of only 6 reasons 13 Colonies got together in the first place. that is. to provide for the national defense. However. under Presidents Carter. Clinton. and Obama. we saw three different periods of disinvestment in our military. Our 30year average of defense spending has been 4.2 percent of GDP. Following the Carter administration. the Reagan administration recapped the military. Then. we had another decline. You see the buildup in the surge in Afghanistan and Iraq. behind two wars. We have been at war for 15 years. I believe in many cases we have burnt out our equipment. and in cases we are beginning to do that with our personnel. with longer tours and more difficult assignments in this hybrid war we are facing today. Then you see under this administration a further decline. now to 3.1 percent of GDP. This is the lowest point since the Vietnam War. and the irony of that is that we are still spending $600 billion of $4 trillion total spending of the Federal Government on our military. The irony is the 30year average of 4.2 percent. which is a hundred basis points below what were currently spendingthats almost $200 billionin a $19 trillion economy. The question is how do we determine the priorities to keep a strong military? To make sure we can fulfill one of six reasons we came together as a country. We are about to have the smallest Army since World War II. the smallest Navy since World War I. and the smallest and oldest Air Force ever. How can this be? The world is more dangerous right now than at any time in my lifetime. We see increased aggression from traditional rivals. Russia and China. We also see the rise of ISIS. partly because of our own intransigence. They have to be stopped now. or we are going to have to deal with them later here. Boko Haram. Al Qaeda. ISISall of these threats are beginning to be interconnected and pose threats not just in the Middle East. but around the world. Finally. we have nuclear threats from rogue regimes. like North Korea and Iran. and emerging. gamechanging technologies. such as cyber threats. which nations like Russia are using for hybrid warfare right now in Eastern Europe. There is an emerging arms race in space. This is why our women and men in uniform need to have the tools and resources to complete their missions around the world. This fiscal crisis is jeopardizing our ability to actually fund the missions being asked of our military today. Let me give two examples. JSTARS is a fleet of planes. 16 in number. These planes in total have over 1 million hours of service. They were used when the Air Force bought them to start with some 30 years ago. They were flown by commercial airlines. such as Air India and Pakistan Air. around the world. Today they fly missions providing critical intelligence. surveillance. and reconnaissanceISRground targeting. and battlefield command and control capabilities to all branches of our military in multiple regions of the world. The problem is they have outlived their useful life and they are being replacedor the theory was that they were going to be replaced. But because of our intransigence in Washington. the funding is not there to replace them. So we are now facing potentially 8 years where we will not be able to fulfill their mission. These are the planes that provide oversight for our men and women who are in harms wayin Afghanistan. Iraq. in Southern Command. where we are intercepting drugs. in the Far East. Wherever the men and women in American uniforms are facing danger. JSTARS is there protecting them in ways no one else can in the military. All of these planes have to be replaced. and the sooner we get started. the better. They will not be able to fulfill their mission over the next 8 years. This chart shows the declining availability of the current fleetdown to zero by 2023. It also shows that under the current plan. pending DOD approval and funding. the replacement fleet doesnt even start coming online until 2023a start date that is now in jeopardy because of the current administrations budget request. JSTARS recap is the No. 4 requisition priority for the Air Force. behind the longrange strike bomber. the new tanker. and the F35. We are not going to be able to fulfill the mission of these airmen and soldiers over the next 8 years unless we do something about it right nowand even then. it might be too late. This is a picture of a 1957 Chevrolet. Some of you will remember what this is like. I remember this car. This is a collectors item. Some of my friends own this car. This car is of the same genre. same age as many of the airplanes we are now flying around the world. That is great. but imagine if you had to drive this carthis was your everyday car and you drove it to work every day back and forth. you depended on it to get you to work every morning and to get you home every night. What would you do if you had to drive it to the west coast and back every week? Imagine what the maintenance time loss would be for breakdown. Imagine what it would be like traveling those distances without all the modern conveniences. such as satellite radioSirius. Pandora. What about the safety factor? These are antiques. The point is that this is a direct analogy of what we are doing with our military today in a very dangerous world. That sounds ridiculous. but you know we have another example. and that is our marines around the world. who are the first to hit a crisis. In Moron. Spain. we have a contingent of marines and one of their missions is to protect our embassies in Africa. PostBenghazi. that takes on a new level of importance. These marines do a great job. They are the very best of what we have in America. They are ready to go. The problem is that because of budget constraints. their fleet of airplanes. the V22 Ospreys. is getting cut in half. and that fundamentally cuts their ability to complete their mission in half. So they will not be able to fulfill the mission they have today the way they are supposed to because of our own intransigence. So. what is causing this great disinvestment in our military? Well. there is only one answer: the national debt. These two crises interlock in a way they never have before. It used to be that defense hawks and budget hawks were separate people. Today. I am living proof that they can embody themselves in the same person. because I am both. We have to be. We no longer have the luxury of debating both issues separately. In the past 7 years. Washington has spent $25 trillion running the Federal Government. That is bad enough. but the problem is that we borrowed $9 trillion of that $25 trillion. That is 35 percent. The Congressional Budget Office says that over the next 10 years we will borrow 30 percent of that. What that means and why that is important is that fundamentally. all of our mandatory spendingsome $3 trillionis mandatory. so our first dollars go to that. The problem is that all of our discretionary spendingall of USAID. our foreign programs. and our expendituresare fundamentally borrowed under that scenario. and that is where we are today. Can you imagine that? With this level of borrowing. every dime we spend on foreign aidI just want to reiterateforeign aid. domestic programs. and militarywe are borrowing that money today because we havent faced up to this crisis. First we have the period here under President Bush. In 2000 our debt was $6 trillion. We added $4 trillion on the back of two wars. In 2008. we had $10 trillion in debt. Now we see we have another $9 trillion in the last 7 years. We will be close to $20 trillion by the time we are through. The yellow here is what the Congressional Budget Office says we are about to face. If we do nothing from today. we will add another $9 trillion to this Federal debtclose to $30 trillion. I am a business guy and I know the capital markets are under great stress today. The danger of this is this is totally unmanageable. If interest rates were to reach their 50year average of just 5.5 percent. we would be paying $1 trillion in interest on a $4 trillion total budget. There is no way that is possible. That is about twice the amount we spend on our military. Our debt crisis is directly impacting our ability to protect our Nation and project power around the world. This puts in jeopardy our very ability to deal with global threats as they come up every day. and believe me. they are coming up every day. Without a strong economy. without dealing with our debt crisis right now. we cant adequately fund our military to confront the growing threats we face. That is a fact. It used to be that fiscal hawks and defense hawks. and I have said this. but today I see that more and more people who are one or the other are beginning to come together and recognize the other problem. They are interrelated in a way they have never been. Believe me. we need a strong defense. I believe we need to be responsible for our Federal finances and the needs of our people here at home. The safety net needs to be maintained. Social Security needs to be saved. These are things we cant ignore. but we have to start dealing with our priorities today. That is why we have to find a way to come togetherDemocrats. Republicans. conservatives. whateverand make sure we protect our economic and our national security priorities. We need to get in a room and iron this out. They are not that complicated. We can find the solutions. As former Admiral Mike Mullen said in 2012. ""1 believe that our debt is the greatest threat to our national security. If we as a country do not address our fiscal imbalances in the nearterm. our national power will erode."" That was 5 years ago. and what have we done since then? Nothing but add debt. Last year. Congress passed a budget resolution. We laid out a conservative vision for what spending levels we should undertake and cut $7 trillion from the Presidents budget. We passed a budget. but because our budget process is broken. we didnt pass most authorizations. We passed appropriations in committees. but we werent able to get them to the floor and vote on them. So we ended up with a CR at the end of the year. and that led to a grand bargain. which I opposed. and an omnibus that added some $9 trillion to our national debt. That was used to fund the government. in the absence of any appropriations bills having been approved. That pushed us to a firstquarter omnibus that really most of us wanted to avoid. At the end of that. eight people got in a room over a weekend and decided how we are going to spend $4 trillion. That is not what our Founders had in mind. That means that the topline spending levels were set by a socalled grand bargain. which I voted against. because it increased spending and would add over $9.5 trillion over the next decade to our national debt. This mounting debt crisis will not fix itselfquite the contrary. It will only grow worse because Social Security and Medicare are going to demand more and more funds from the general operating fund because of the imbalances in those two items. If we dont get serious about solving this debt crisis right now. we will not be able to fully support our national security and our domestic priorities. Recently. Richard Haass. a former top State Department official. said in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. ""Our inability to deal with our debt challenge will detract from the appeal of the American political and economic model"" as we try to influence young democracies around the world. He continued: ""The result will be a world that is less democratic and increasingly less deferential to U.S. concerns in matters of security."" We must create restraint and fiscal sanity in Washington. In the private sector. you fix a business by first drilling down and finding the underlying problem. The way that Washington funds the Federal Government. the time it takes to complete the federal budget. and the fact that the current process allows Members of Congress to put off making tough decisions are the real problem. In business. this would never be allowed. In your personal home. this cannot be tolerated. but somehow we are able to do it here year after year. This process has only worked four times in the past 42 years. It has been encouraging to hear the Senate Budget Committee chairman. Senator MIKE ENZI. and the House Budget chairman. Congressman TOM PRICE from my home State of Georgia. make this a priority for this year. I believe they are making great progress. Both are having hearings to find out if there are models around the world that do it better than we do. We are finding those examples. especially at a time when we cannot allow the process to break down and result in more continuing resolutions. omnibus bills. or shortterm funding fights that dont solve anything. We must also reduce redundant programs. roll back the regulatory regime. and focus on growing our economy through overhauling our archaic Tax Code. and unlocking. finally. our Nations full economic and energy potential. Finally. we have to save Social Security and Medicare and tackle the biggest problems of our overall health care costs. To do this. Washington needs to stop pretending that these crises will go away on their own and that the national debt will somehow solve itself. It wont. In fact. it has already done irreversible damage to our credibility and capability on the world stage. Our mounting debt crisis is already raising questions from our allies around the world about how we will be able to stand by our international commitments. I just got back from a trip to Europe and the Middle East. The No. 1 point raised to us by leaders. heads of state in those countries. was that America needs to lead again. To lead again. we need to get our financial house in order. Our debt crisis and a failed foreign policy has served to confuse our allies and embolden our enemies. It threatens our ability to defend our country. period. Also. the interest payments on our debt is affecting our education. infrastructure. and morehere at home in the programs that are necessary. Imagine if we didnt have that unproductive responsibility of unnecessary interest. Every Member of this body knows we need to act now. My question is. why arent we acting? The challenge is to stop talking about it theoretically and start putting solutions into practice. That is why Georgians sent me to the U.S. Senate. and that is why I will continue fighting on this every day. Lets not lose sight of Congresss No. 1 responsibility. We are charged in the Constitution under article I to responsibly fund the Federal Government and to ensure that the 6 reasons why 13 Colonies got together in the first place can actually be realized. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140099059,Mr. President. first. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. and the ranking member. Senator REED. for their tireless work in doing Gods work here. and that is making sure we provide for the needs of our men and women in uniform around the world. There are only 6 reasons why 13 Colonies got together in the first place. One of those six was to provide for the national defense. That is what we are talking about this week. As we debate the National Defense Authorization Act this week. I personally would like to add a little different perspective to this debate. In my opinion. today the world is more dangerous than at any time in my lifetime. We have major threats from various perspectives. No. 1. we see the rise of traditional rivalsRussia. Chinaand evermore aggressiveness from both. We see the rise of ISIS and attendant networks around the country supporting terrorism and the Islamic State. We see the proliferation of nuclear capability among rogue nations. such as North Korea and Iran. We see the hybrid warfare. including cyber warfare. that is being perpetrated today. What we are not talking about is the growing arms race in space. All this adds to a very dangerous world and makes it very mobile and puts people right here in the United States in danger. as we have seen already. As we face these increasing threats. though. at the very time we need our military to be strongest. we are disinvesting in our military. You can see from this chart that over the last 30 years or so. we have had three Democratic Presidents. and all have disinvested in the military for different reasons. First we had President Carter. then we had President Clinton. and now we have President Obama. We have disinvested in the military to the point that today we are spending about 3 percent of our GDP on our military. That is about $600 billion in round numbers. The 30year average is 4 percent. That difference. that 1 percentage point of difference. is $200 billion. What I am concerned about is that as we sit here facing these additional threats today. we have the smallest Army since World War II. the smallest Navy since World War I. and the oldest and smallest Air Force ever. According to the Congressional Budget Office. the current plan is even worse than that. It says that in the next 10 years we will continue to disinvest in our military down to 2.6 percent of our GDP. That is another estimated $100 billion of reduction. This is a new low that I believe we cannot allow to happen. As we look at our overall defense spending authorization levels today in this NDAA bill. we are falling short of where we need to be based on the threats we face. Dont just take my word for it. The last defense budget that Secretary Bob Gates actually proposed was in 2011. That was the last one proposed before sequestration took place. and that was the last defense budget that was based on the actual assessment of the threats against our country. not arbitrary budget limitations. His estimate at that time for this year. fiscal year 2016. was $646 billion. As for 2017. our topline estimate right nowwhat we are trying to get approvedis $602 billion. That is a far cry. By the way. Secretary Gates estimate was before ISIS. before the Benghazi attacks on our Embassy. before Russia seized Crimea. before Russia went into the Ukraine. and before China started building islands in the South China Sea. I can go on. How did we get here? Today. financially. we have an absolute financial catastrophe. In the last 7 years. we have borrowed about 30 percent of what we have spent as a Federal Government. It is projected that over the next 10 years we will again borrow about 30 percent of what we spend as a Federal Government. My argument has been that we can no longer be just debt hawks. we have to also be defense hawks. By the way. those two can no longer be mutually exclusive. In order to solve the global security crisis. I believe we have to solve our own financial debt crisis. We all know we have $19 trillion of debt today. What is worse. though. is that CBO estimates that is going to grow to $30 trillion over the next decade unless we do something about it. This chart shows the real problem. Right now. the problem is not discretionary spending. which is actually down from around 2010about $1.4 trilliondown to about $1.1 trillion today. So discretionary spendingnow. we may have gotten there the wrong way. We used the sequestration to do that. But I would argue that discretionary spending is not where the major problem is today. The major probably is in the mandatory spendingSocial Security. Medicare. Medicaid. pension and benefits for Federal employees. and the interest on our debt. We have been living in an artificial world where interest rates have been basically zero. We are paying fewer dollars on the Federal debt todayfewer dollars than we were in 2000 when our debt was onethird of what it is today. To deal with the global security crisis. we need to be honest about what our military needs. That gets difficult sometimes. Today we have national security priorities that arent getting properly funded. and yet we know we are spending money inefficiently. First of all. we have missions that we are not able to maintain. Take a look at the marine expeditionary units around the world. These are the MEUs around the world. I visited a couple of these. by the way. Because of defense cuts. there arent enough amphibious ships for the marines to have what is known as theater reserve force. also known as MEUs. As a result. for missions like crisis response and Embassy protection in Africa. for example. we now have a Special Purpose MAGTF covering this task based on the ground in Moron. Spain. I personally visited with those people. The bestI mean the very best of America is in uniform around the world taking care of our business and protecting our interests and our freedom here at home. Even this force in Moron. Spain. is seeing a cut in their fleet size of airplanes. They are selfcontained. They can get themselves from where they are to the point of crisis very quickly. but we are cutting their ability to do that because of limitations from a financial standpoint. Another example is the recapitalization program for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. or what we call JSTARS. the No. 4 acquisition priority for the Air Force and a critical provider of ISR ground targeting and battlefield command and control to all branches of our military in almost every region of the world. As the old fleet is reaching the end of its service life. we will have to have a new fleet come online quickly. The problem is we are seeing a projected gap of 7 years where that capability will no longer be available in full force for the people who need it the mostpeople on the ground and in harms way. We are not able to fund the military at the force size we need either. As a result. we are putting greater pressure on personnel. burning up our troops. putting pressure on families. and elongating our deployments. They spend more time on rotations internationally and not enough time with their families at home. and it is causing problems. It is causing turnover. problems with families. and so forth. The forces we have are not getting the training they need. For example. twothirds of Army units are only training at the squad and platoon levels. not in full combat formations. We have Air Force pilots actually leaving the service today because they cut back so dramatically on training flights. These examples highlight why we need to scrutinize every dollar we spend on defense so we can ensure these dollars go to our critical requirements of protecting our men and women around the world. To that end. we need to improve fiscal accountability at the DOD and highlight the needs we are not currently fulfilling. For example. our Department of Defense has never been audited. Even today. we cannot dictate to the DOD that they provide an audit. Can you imagine Walmart doing that? First of all. the answer is this: We are too big. too complicated. and it is just too difficult to do. Can you imagine Walmart calling the SEC and saying: Sorry. we are not going to comply with your requirements. The DOD is not that much bigger than Walmart. I think we should withhold funds to the accountable agency until a plan is produced that would also allow the Pentagon to keep track of its military equipment. It has been 13 years since that law was passed. and yet they are still not in compliance. This is all just about funding our military. but we also have to be responsible. The men and women in uniform and on the frontlines deserve that. Finally. to address a critical need we discussed earlier. JSTARS. Senator ISAKSON and I have been working to get the replacement fleet ready to go sooner rather than later to eliminate this gap. This fleet must get online faster than the current plan or we face a potential 7year gap. I am committed to ensuring that we have what we need to support our service men and women around the world. These efforts will make the Pentagon accountable and focus funds on critical priorities. This debate is all about setting the right priorities. not just here at home with the military but also with other domestic programs and mandatory expenditures. This debate is all about setting the right priorities to make sure we can do what the Constitution calls on us to do. and that is to provide for the national defense. The national debt crisis and our global security crisis are interlocked inextricably. We are not going to solve the dilemma of providing for national defense until we solve this national debt crisis. Our servicemen. servicewomen. and combatant commanders dont have and will not have the training. equipment. and preparation they absolutely need to fulfill their missions as they face growing threats. It is time that Washington faces up to this crisis. This is not just about the NDAA. This is about the defense of our country and the future of our very way of life. We simply have to come to grips with this NDAA. pass it. and make sure we find a way to address this debt crisis so every year going forward we dont have this drama of finding a way to fund our military to protect our country. We simply have to come to grips and set the right priorities required to defend our country. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.
1140111430,Mr. President. I rise tonight after having listened to several floor speeches today. I dont understand it. Here we are again with problems such as the debt. the Zika virus. funding our military. and yet we spent the majority of the day in this body talking about something I think we have already decided is not going to change this year. and that is the potential nomination to the vacancy on the Supreme Court. I just think I need to do this one more time. I have spoken before about my position. and I want to rise in support of Senator GRASSLEY. the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I think it is important that I again discuss why I believe the Senate should not hold hearings or schedule a vote on any Supreme Court nominee until the American people have chosen whom they want to be their next President. I would first like to address this issue of the Senates responsibility under the Constitution with respect to judicial matters and judicial nominees in particular. According to article II. section 2. the President has the power to nominate Supreme Court Justicesnothing new there. We in this body have the power to either consent or withhold our consent from this nominee. The minority leader himself said at that time when referring to the Senates constitutional responsibility to confirm President George W. Bushs judicial nominee: Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. He then went on to say: The Senate is not a rubber stamp for the executive branch. There is also no provision in the Constitution requiring the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings for all judicial nominees. In fact. the Constitution and its provisions laying out the process for confirming judicial nominees were ratified 28 years before the Senate Judiciary Committee even came into existence. Therefore. it is clear to me that the Senates action in withholding consent from this nominee is entirely consistent with our rights and responsibilities as a coequal branch of government under the Constitution. By choosing to withhold our consent in this case. we are doing our job. just as we have said all along and just as our jobs are laid out in the Constitution. I would also like to address the argument that the lack of hearings for a Supreme Court nominee this year is somehow unprecedented. That is just nonsense. In modern times. the opposite is actually true. The last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose and a nominee was confirmed in a Presidential election year was actually in 1932. But the last time this situation occurred where we had a divided government and we had a Supreme Court Justice nominated and confirmed in that year was 1888. Mr. President. a lot of water has gone under the bridge since then. and both sides have taken this position. Furthermore. my colleagues across the aisle have consistently argued over the years that the Senate should not act on a Supreme Court nomination during a Presidential election year. The hypocrisy of this situation is just amazing to me. As an outsider to this process. this is what drives my friends and people back home absolutely mad. It was thenSenator BIDENour current Vice Presidentwho was chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time. who said that President George H.W. Bush should avoid a Supreme Court nomination until after the 1992 Presidential election. ThenSenator BIDEN went further than what we are doing today: He then said the President shouldnt even nominate someone. He made the same point my colleagues and I are making today when he said: It is my view that if a Supreme Court justice resigns tomorrow or within the next several weeks. or resigns at the end of the year. President Bush should consider following the practice of a majority of his predecessors and notand notname a nominee until after the November election is completed. I dont know what else to say. Mr. President. Both sides have made this same argument we are making today in the past. Finally. I believe the decision to not hold hearings for a Supreme Court nominee this year is a wise course of action in the midst of a Presidential election. As I have said all along. this is not the time we want to interject into this political process the decision to make a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Courta decision that may tip the balance of this particular Court. ThenSenator BIDEN also said. when discussing the potential of holding Supreme Court confirmation hearings against the backdrop of electionyear politics: A process that is already in doubt in the minds of many will become distrusted by all. Senate consideration of a nominee under these circumstances is not fair to the President. to the nominee. or to the Senate itself. I agree with thenSenator BIDEN that the confirmation of a lifetime appointee to our Nations highest Court is far too important to become entangled in the partisan wrangling during a Presidential election year. As a member of the Judiciary Committee. I am. therefore. proud to stand with Chairman GRASSLEY and my colleagues in the committee in saying no Supreme Court nominee should be considered by the Senate before the next President is sworn into office. I also believe that it shouldnt be taken up in a lameduck session. You cant have it both ways. Mr. President.

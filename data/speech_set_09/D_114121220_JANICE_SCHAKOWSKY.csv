1140042762,Mr. Speaker. I support workers and the important transportation and infrastructure jobs they do. They deserve the certainty and support that a longterm. wellfunded highway funding bill would provide. H.R. 3038 is not that bill. Our infrastructure is rated a D+ by the American Society of Civil Engineers. A transportation system that was once the envy of the world has fallen into disrepair. Weve passed dozens of shortterm extensions over the past decade. and they havent done the trick. We know where this bill will leave us: infrastructure projects wont be planned beyond December. longoverdue projects will hang in limbo. and workers will be left wondering if theyll spend the holidays unemployed. Every business owner. worker. and state and local official I have spoken with has asked for the same thing: a longterm. wellfunded bill. In order to do that. we need to make a commitment to filling the funding gap from the gas taxwhich has not been increased in more than two decades. I support gradually raising the gas tax to pay for our infrastructure priorities. I also joined 184 of my Democratic colleagues in supporting a motion that would have paid for a longterm. wellfunded highway bill by preventing corporate tax inversionsthe process of moving corporate headquarters overseas. Just one Republican supported that proposal. Doing either of those things would sustain the vital infrastructure investments we need. Those who suggest we cant afford a good highway bill are wrong. We are the richest country in the world at the richest time in our history. Funding our roads and bridges is a priority. We can afford it. and the American people demand that we do. What we cannot do is continue the path of unpredictability and shortterm planning that results from these stopgap measures for our highways. bridges. and other infrastructure projects. That is why I voted against H.R. This is the greatest country in the world. and there is nothing we cannot do. Its time to act accordingly by advancing a longterm. wellfunded transportation bill.
1140049001,"In 2002. the President of the United States and this Congress voted to address the perceived threat of a mushroom cloud coming from Iraq by going to war. a war that unleashed massive violence in the Mideast and threatens the world even today. The Obama administration. faced with the actual threat of a nuclear weaponized Iran. has chosen. instead. the path of diplomacy. the path of peace. and I am proud to support this historic agreement. As the President said: ""This deal demonstrates that American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful changechange that makes our country. and the world. safer and more secure."" Voices inside and outside the Congress are calling for a rejection of this historic agreement. among them the same neocons who stampeded the United States into war with Iraq. They were wrong then. and they are wrong now. Iran is now 2 to 3 months from being able to produce a nuclear weapon. and yet the critics have offered no credible alternative to a deal that blocks all the paths to a nuclear weapon. Now. we know this deal is not perfect. Iran is a bad actor. The President and all of us would have much preferred a deal that prohibits Iran from enriching any uranium forever and maintains sanctions until Iran changes its behavior and becomes a responsible member of the world community. But that deal didnt happenbecause it never could have happened. This deal greatly improves the outlook for peace by blocking all of Irans paths to a nuclear weapon. and this is carefully spelled out in the agreement itself. often in very technical language: Irans stockpiles of rich uranium will be reduced from enough for 10 bombs to less than 1. the number of Irans installed centrifuges is reduced by over twothirds. and far from trusting Iran. the deal demands the most robust. intrusive inspections regime ever in an international agreement. We heard yesterday. many of us. from the ambassadors from five of our allies in the P5+1. These ambassadors said if the United States walks away. the deal collapses. Iran would be without any constraints to move ahead with its nuclear weapons program. All paths would be open. There would be no inspections whatsoever. no insight into Irans activities. The ability of the United States to build meaningful international coalitions would be eroded for the foreseeable future. I view this upcoming vote on Iran as one of the most important of my career. and. my colleagues. I would say that is true for everyone. It is one of the most important of my life. For me. the choice is clear: diplomacy over war. Colleagues. lets remember. nothing is off the table. But why wouldnt we choose peace and give peace a chance?"
1140061418,Madam Chairman. by reducing appropriations for vehicle safety programs. Mr. BURGESS amendment is making it impossible for NHTSA. the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. to actually carry out its critical vehicle safety functions. At the same time that this amendment drastically cuts funding for critical safety functions. the amendment also requires more reporting that diverts necessary resources. both people and dollars. from NHTSAs mission to save lives. prevent injuries. and reduce economic costs from traffic crashes. The average age of cars on the road in the United States has hit a record high at 111/2 years. That is just the average. Many cars are even older. Instead of fully acknowledging this reality. this amendment only requires manufacturers to keep limited safety records for 15 years and only requires recall repairs to be free of charge for 10 years. The recent GM ignition switch recall covered vehicles that were more than 10 years old. That means that. under this amendment. some owners of defective GM cars could have to pay to have the defect repaired. The amendment also exempts from motor vehicle safety standards replica cars. Brandnew cars would not have to meet any safety standards as long as they look like a car that was made 25 years ago. These cars could be exempt from seatbelt and airbag requirements. basic but crucial safety equipment. We have no idea how many replica cars will end up on the roads. Although each lowvolume manufacturer is limited to 500 vehicles. there are no limits on the number of manufacturers. The lowvolume provision would also exempt manufacturers of replicas. unlike all others who manufacture cars in small batches. from the EPAs emission standards concerning greenhouse gasses. Replica cars also would be exempt from State inspections and emissions testing and evaporative emission standards. In the wake of the recent VW scandal. it is unthinkable that we would make it easier for any manufacturers to bypass emission standards and to continue to put public health at risk. The amendment also allows automakers and others to use compliance with guidelines as evidence of compliance with motor vehicle safety standards. By prohibiting NHTSA from using guidelines for enforcement purposes. the majority obviously recognizes that nonbinding guidelines are not the same as actual safety requirements. But at the same time. this amendment allows automakers to evade liability by showing that they complied with nonbinding guidelines instead of having to prove that they complied with safety mandates. This double standard makes no sense. Instead of ensuring that automakers are held responsible for safety violations they commit. this amendment gives them yet another out. This amendment will adversely affect the public health and safety. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140077621,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. and I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2017. the socalled Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. Far from common sense. this unnecessary legislation would deny consumers critical information about the food that we eat. I began my career a long time ago as a consumer advocate. joining together with a small group of housewives to get retailers to put expiration dates on the products they sell. This was way back in 1970. when every single item in the grocery store was code dated. Now expiration dates are on nearly every single product because this change was good not only for consumers. but it was good for the retailers. They were able to control their inventory much betterless waste because dates are on the food. We can also control our refrigerators a little bit better as well. [ 1000 Consumers can make better decisions with better information. and retailers can better control their inventory. Similarly. I believe menu labeling would be helpful to both consumers and retail food establishments. as more and more people are asking for this information and making smart decisions. At a time when over 78 million adult Americans are obese and the estimated cost of obesity in the United States is $147 billion a year. we should be embracing efforts to reduce this enormous cost to our healthcare system. In fact. a recent Harvard study found restaurant menu calorie labeling could save over $4.6 billion in healthcare costs over 10 years. That is not chump change. Countless consumer and public health organizations oppose H.R. 2017. That includes the American Diabetes Association. the American Cancer Society. the American Heart Association. the American Public Health Association. and the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Supporters claim that menu labeling requirements would be too difficult to implement. That is what I heard from my colleague. But we know this isnt true. Why? Because California. New York City. the State of Vermont. and several counties around the country have successfully implemented menu labeling. Only chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the same name must post calorie information. So this is not about small businesses must post calorie information. Many of these chains have already had to comply with menu labeling in the places where it is currently required. In addition. the National Restaurant Association has long supported menu labeling. and consumers find this to be an asset. Claims that implementation of menu labeling has been rushed or has not allowed industry to weigh in are simply false. It has been 6 years since the law first passed. giving industry plenty of time to weigh in with the FDA and implement this law. The FDA has already issued a 1year extension. and the FY16 omnibus delayed implementation even further. The FDA has allowed for plenty of industry participation through this 6year process. and their final regulations provide a great deal of flexibility. H.R. 2017 would not only decrease consumer access to calorie information. but it would allow for inconsistent or confusing menu information. This legislation. for example. allows food establishments to simply make up their own serving sizes. For example. the bill would allow establishments to list the calories for one chicken wing as opposed to an order of chicken wings and wouldnt require the total number of calories to be listed. We have also heard that many establishments. especially chain pizza restaurants. claim that menu labeling would be too difficult for them to account for all the variations in their menu offerings. But lets be clear. Pizza chains only need to post calories for the standard menu items they list on their menu boards. not every possible pizza combination. So clearly. California. Vermont. and the City of New York have figured it out. I also took it upon myself to come up with an easy template for pizza restaurants to use and that is free of charge. I am not going to charge them. It shows how easy it is for them to clearly display the calorie information and account for the different pizza options. You can see right here. So we have one slice of cheese pizza. I just made up these calories. I think they are way too low. But lets say one slice of cheese pizza is 250 calories. God bless them if they can do that. So then. for sausage. you would add calories. mushrooms. you would add calories. pepperoni. add calories. onion. I think it is rather attractive. easy to read. and important for consumers. Pizza is undeniably one of the most common menu items in America. On any given day. one out of every eight Americans eats pizzaone out of eight. The United States spends $37 billion a year on pizza. which accounts for onethird of the global pizza market. H.R. 2017 still requires chain pizza restaurants to calculate the calories for their menu items. so. clearly. it cant be that difficult to come up with this information. Instead. this bill would allow them to present calorie information in a deceptive manner and restrict customer access to this information. depending on where they place an order. Given how often pizza is consumed. it is critical that consumers have access to accurate calorie information at all points of sale. More and more. people are planning their caloric intake and making healthier decisions for themselves. We should be encouraging this and providing consumers with the information they need to make smart decisions about their health. So I encourage my colleagues to oppose this unnecessary bill that only serves to harm and confuse consumers. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140077659,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered today by Representatives MCMORRIS RODGERS and CARDENAS. This amendment would further undermine consumer confidence in the nutrition information they receive from restaurants and retail food establishments. One could call it flexibility. which actually the current legislation provides. and others. including me. would call it adding confusion. Under the Federal menu labeling law. restaurants and retail food establishments are supposed to have a reasonable basis for determining calorie and nutrition information for their menu items. This can be done using a nutrient database. such as USDAs National Nutrient Database. cookbooks. recipes. nutrition fact labels. or FDAs nutrient values. among others. Again. the FDA is allowing significant flexibility. as it is. in how establishments determine this information. What is most important to the agency is that this information is accurate and consistent. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about changes to the nutrition information based on an employee being too heavyhanded with one ingredient. like pickles. or perhaps not following the recipe appropriately. We can all understand that in cooking. this type of flexibility is needed. FDAs guidance addresses the question of how closely standard menu items must match the nutrient values. advising that an establishment ""must take reasonable steps to ensure that how you prepare your product . . . and how you serve your product are the same as those used to determine the calorie and nutrient declarations."" The McMorris RodgersCirdenas amendment further undermines the ""reasonable basis"" standard outlined in H.R. 2017 and in FDAs final rule by permitting any type of variation for any reason from the nutrient content disclosed to the actual nutrient content in the standard menu item. Under this amendment. a restaurant would be able to change their recipe or how they prepare the food or swap out one ingredient for another and not have to change the nutrient information they disclose to account for these variations. This amendment would also allow for further inconsistencies from restaurant to restaurant or grocery store to grocery store. as what might be a permissible variation to one restaurant or one grocery store may not be permissible to others. again. potentially creating an uneven playing field among the industry. It is also important to note that this amendment is inconsistent with requirements for food labeling under the Federal Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act. This law requires that food labeling be truthful and not misleading. If nutrient content disclosures can vary for any reason to any extent. it would undermine such requirement in the Federal Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act. a requirement that the food industry has long had to meet. As we have said all along. for calorie and nutrition information to be valuable to consumers. it must be accurate and it must be consistent. If consumers have no reason to believe that what is disclosed by a restaurant is accurate. then the disclosure of nutrient information is rendered meaningless. I believe FDAs guidance has provided a great deal of flexibility for how nutrient content should be disclosed. and I know the agency is committed to working with covered establishments to meet the requirement of providing accurate. consistent nutrition information in a way that is feasible for the establishment. I urge my colleagues to vote ""no"" on the amendment. Mr. Chairman. how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 11/2 minutes remaining."
1140087167,I thank my colleague so much for taking the leadership this evening on such an important and central issue. It is really about our democracy. Our country has long been known and respected around the world as a beacon of democracy. We aspire to let every person participate in our system of government and give each persons views and votes equal weight. But today our democracy itself is in jeopardy. Instead of promoting voter participation. States are erecting barriers to keep Americans from voting. Instead of giving people an equal voice in our elections. corporations and the wealthy are claiming outsized influence. The Supreme Court. tasked with protecting our rights. is being crippled by congressional inaction. Over the past days. thousands of Americans have come to Washington to demand that we restore American democracy. I join them in their call for action: Pass the Voting Rights Amendment Act. stop the outsized role that money plays in politics. and fill the vacancy on our Supreme Court. Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act broadened access to democracy and fulfilled the promise of the 15th Amendment. It ensured that every American had the opportunity to take part in the democratic process. But in recent years. courts and State legislatures have torn away at these rights. In 2013. the Supreme Court rolled back voter protections with its misguided Shelby County decision. striking down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act. Before the Shelby County decision. the Voting Rights Act required States with a history of voter discrimination to clear any changes that they wanted to make to their voting laws in advance. What happened when this provision got struck down? No surprise. Certain States rushed to pass new voting restrictions. On the very day of the ruling. Texas officials announced they would implement a photo ID law that had previously been blocked. North Carolina went even further. imposing a strict photo ID law as well as cutting back early voting and reducing the time period for voter registration. This law disproportionately affects communities of color. This November is the first Presidential election since the weakening of the Voting Rights Act. Sixteen States now have new voting restrictions in place. The Voting Rights Amendment Act. introduced by my Republican colleague. Mr. SENSENBRENNER. would restore key protections of the Voting Rights Act. Despite bipartisan support for this bill. House leadership has simply failed to take action. The inaction is unforgivable. But voting rights are not the only part of our democratic process that is under attack. Citizens United. another misguided Supreme Court decision. has unleashed a flood of money from rich donors and powerful corporations that is now drowning out the voice of the American people. In the 2014 elections. the top 100 donors to superPACs gave nearly as much as 4.75 million small donors combined. This election cycle. the Koch brothers alone have pledged to spend almost $900 million. Just in the early phase of the 2016 Presidential race. 158 families were responsible for more than half of all the money raised in Presidential campaigns. The American people want action. They are demanding that we get money out of politicsthe big money. Congress continues to ignore the will of the American people. Republican leadership has failed to take legislative action to address the egregious spending allowed by the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. For example. they havent brought up H.R. 20. the Government By the People Act. which would provide matching funds for candidates who agree to rely on small donors to fund their campaigns. This would empower individuals to support candidates and balance the influence of big money. This is the sort of legislation the House ought to be considering. We dont just need legislative fixes. though. Repairing our democracy also requires confirming justices who understand that corporations are not people and money is not speech. But here. too. Republicans are refusing to do their job. On March 16. President Obama fulfilled his constitutional dutyyou can read it in the Constitutionby nominating D.C. Circuit Court Judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. But even before Garlands nomination was announcedin fact. just about an hour after Judge Antonin Scalia passed awaySenator Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL promised nothing but obstruction. He said he would not hold a hearing. he would not have a vote. and that this was going to wait until the next election. Republican Senators have refused to hold hearings. they have refused to have an upordown vote. and many of them have refused to even meet with the nominee at all. Even those Senate Republicans who havent publicly endorsed this obstruction are doing the bare minimum. They may have courtesy meetings. they may even say they would support hearings. or maybe even a vote. but words are not enough. We need action. not photo ops. The Constitution makes clear that the Presidentthe sitting President. this President. Barack Obamanominates judges to the Supreme Court. Then the Senates job is to advise and consent on the Presidents nominee. It doesnt say: and you only do it in the first 7 years of a Presidents term. and you dont do anything in the last year of a Presidents term. There is simply no excuse for the Senate to resist taking any action. I find it really disrespectful to the American people and I find it disrespectful to this President that they are saying that he cannot have the right. as every other President in history. even in the last year of his term. has had to nominate and have considered. and. in fact. all of those nominated in the last year were actually approved. So there is no excuse for the Senate to resist taking any action. Senate Republicans are putting politics ahead of the Constitution. That is not democracy. Big donors are not democracy. Taking away voting rights is not democracy. It is time for this House of Representatives to really represent the American people. listen to their calls for change. and take action to strengthen our democracy. Again. I thank my colleague for yielding.
1140098651,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that Mr. HASTINGS can offer H.R. 769. a resolution to shut down the select panel that we call the select panel to attack womens health. House Republicans created this panel based on a lie and fraudulent videotapes that have been discredited by three House committees. 12 States. and a Texas grand jury that actually indicted the video maker. They have used this fraud as a pretext to conduct a lethally dangerous witch hunt aimed at womens health clinics and scientists conducting promising research on diseases like Alzheimers. MS. and the Zika virus. Panel Republicans are bullying witnesses and abusing congressional authority in a manner not seen since the days of Senator Joe McCarthy. But this time. peoples lives. not just their livelihoods. are at stake. Republicans have issued dozens of unilateral subpoenas without first seeking voluntary cooperation. They are demanding the names of researchers. students. clinical personnel. doctors. and medical students. amassing a database that could be released publicly at any time. Republicans refuse to put rules in place to protect these names and have reneged on public promises to do so. Instead. they have publicly released names and confidential documents. They issued a press release naming a doctor who has already faced decades of harassment and violence. disclosed the time. place. and location of his appearance before the panel. and fueled the flames by comparing him to a convicted murderer. They have repeatedly used inflammatory rhetoric. comparing researchers to Nazi war criminals and echoing words of antiabortion activists that were also used by the gunman who shot 12 people. killing 3. at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. Republicans have demanded and obtained information that they have no right or need to know. including records of victims of rape and personal financial information. The Republicans are abusing power and putting peoples lives in danger in pursuit of their agenda to limit legal abortion and a womans right to choose and to shut down fetal tissue research. Fetal tissue research has historically had broad bipartisan support. It is the basis for key vaccines that have saved millions of lives. including the polio vaccine. The socalled investigative panel has already had a chilling effect on research. drying up the supply of needed tissue for research on multiple sclerosis and threatening other diseases. including Alzheimers and diabetes.
1140107467,"Mr. Speaker. our Nation is grieving. We are tired. We are tired of the violence that too often unsettles our communities. What a week we had last week. We were horrified by the deaths of Lorne Ahrens. Michael Smith. Michael Krol. Patrick Zamarripa. and Brent Thompsonfive officers murdered by a sniper in Dallas while they were on duty. We saw very troubling videos of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling being shot. Today we also mark the 1month anniversary of the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. a hateful act on the LGBT community that took the lives of 49 people. This shooting shook the country. as have the many mass shootings that have preceded it. As we still process these deaths. daily violence continues in communities around the country. Over the weekend. the total number of shootings in Chicago. where I come from. this year exceeded 2.100. Over 300 people in Chicago have now died from gun violence in 2016. I have received hundreds and hundreds of letters from constituents of all ages concerned about the effect of gun violence in our communities and in their communities. Yesterday I received a letter from a young constituent. an 8yearold named Kaline. She wrote: ""I read the SunTimes every day like my dad. I read and still think about the story of Tyshawn Lee. Its just hitting my mind all the time because its not fair. It makes me cry."" Tyshawn Lee was a 9yearold boy in Chicago deliberately assassinated. shot multiple times in the head. Kaline continues: ""I hope people can make better decisions about what to do with guns. I hope people stop fighting about whether we should do gun control because I worry more people and kids like Tyshawn will be killed."" We cant accept violence as normal. This is not the country Kaline should have to grow up in. And how do you explain to an 8year old that in America. with 91 people dying from gun violence every single day. we have taken no meaningful action? We take action all the time to protect our kids from threats to their safety. We have regulations in place on teddy bears and pacifiers. to protect childrens health and safety. but nothing for guns. Guns are specifically exempted from regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. the agency charged with protecting consumers from unreasonable risk or injury or death. Gun manufacturers are protected from liability for damage caused by their weapons. The Centers for Disease Control is actually prohibited. in law. from studying the public health risk of guns. Robert. a 91yearold and a veteran of World War II from my district wrote: ""You know better than I do the vast array of efforts to protect the American people from the recklessness and avarice in the marketplace. yet Congress has failed the people in the matter of gun control . . . Today the American public is crying for laws."" he says. Robert is right. I can think of no other product or industry that has so few measures in place to protect our safety. and we need to rethink our approach to guns. We cant put the interests of gun manufacturers and the gun lobby ahead of the safety of our communities. Those of us in Congress have the power to do something. and it is long past time for us to act. We can start with measures that have broad support among the American people. Ninety percent of Americans support comprehensive background checks. Background checks would help reduce the flood of weapons that come into Chicago from gun shows and online sales. Would it stop every shooting? Of course it wouldnt. But would it save some lives? Absolutely. My heart goes out to the families in Dallas and Orlando and Chicago and so many other places that have had the lives of their loved ones stolen away by gun violence. and we need to grieve. But after that moment of silence. we must direct our sadness and our anger into action. The problem of violence in communities may seem insurmountable. and no single policy will stop every death. But we should start by passing commonsense gun legislation supported by the vast majority of the American people. We need a vote on legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Republicans and Democrats and gun owners and NRA members agree that background checks for every gun purchase and closing the gun show loopholes and all the other loopholes will help. So give us a vote. Mr. Speaker. My constituents are crying for action. Lets act. not ignore their cries any longer. Give us a vote."
1140111592,Mr. Speaker. on July 14. House Republicans streamed out of the Capitol as I stood on this floor with my Democratic colleagues calling for action on the public health crises facing our country: gun violence. Zika. and Flint. Michigans. poisoned water. It is now nearly 8 weeks later. Congress has returned from the longest summer recess in more than 60 years. but we still have seen no action from the Republican majority on our Nations most urgent crises. Meanwhile. we are in the midst of a Zika outbreak. Puerto Rico is on track to see 25 of its population infected. Florida has locally transmitted Zika cases. and it is only a matter of time until we see cases in other States. Actually. we have seen some in other States. Parents who should be looking forward to the birth of a child are terrified that the baby may be born with devastating lifelong health problems. Yet. Republicans refuse to provide the funding we need to combat this outbreak. Instead of passing a bill with sufficient funding. Republicans insist on making sure. believe it or not. that the Confederate flag can fly at VA cemeteries and on preventing family planning clinics from helping patients with Zika. That is right. Even though Zika has the greatest impact on women who are. or could become. pregnant. Republicans want to add a rider to stop the family planning clinics that serve women from responding to Zika. Today. family planning clinics. like Planned Parenthood. are already on the front lines in fighting against Zika. In addition to providing family planning services. Planned Parenthood volunteers are visiting 25.000 households in Florida to find people of reproductive age. especially young women. who have likely not been reached by State or Federal Zika education efforts. They are providing Zika kits for pregnant women. containing items like insect repellent and standing water treatment. Family planning clinics are an important part of our response to Zika. But instead of recognizing that fact. Republicans have doubled down on their extreme views on womens health. Dr. Anthony Fauci. the head of the Infectious Disease Institute at the National Institutes of Health. has said in no uncertain terms that if we do not pass additional Zika funding. we will have to stop our efforts to develop a vaccine. Already. Federal agencies have had to borrow money from other critical health priorities to address the Zika problem. We have allowed money to be takenor the Republicans havefrom Ebola. cancer. heart disease. and diabetes. We cant keep fighting back by cutting back our fight against these other diseases. Republicans refusal to pass Zika funding will have serious. deadly consequences for years to come. Americans cant wait any longer. At the same time. the people of Flint are still waiting for congressional assistance after the tragic lead poisoning crisis in that city. I joined 25 of my Democratic colleagues in Flint earlier this year. We heard from nearly 200 community members. including parents. worried about their childrens future. After that trip. we said we wouldnt forget these families. and Democrats havent. Again and again. I have joined with my colleagues to call on Republican leadership to bring the Families of Flint Actthat is a billto the floor. Flints Congressman KILDEEs bill would provide supplemental funding to repair and support this communitys needs. Lead has often devastating brain development effects. but families can meet that challenge if we provide the health. education. and the wraparound services that they need. But months later. we have come up dry. No bill to fund Flint aid. No funding for Zika. No gun safety legislation. Nothing. What is on the floor this week? Well. we have bills that will help Wall Street make even more money. And we have a bill to impeach the head of the IRS. mentioned by exactly no onezero constituents in my districtover the 7week recess. We have wasted critical weeks during the summer recess. and Republicans are now wasting our first week back in session. We have only 15 legislative days before we are scheduled to leave town again. Lets get to work and pass the critical funding for Flint and Zika and do something about gun violence.

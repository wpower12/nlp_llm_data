1130023748,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 3. the Northern Route Approval Act. which allows construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Im happy to say it passed out of full committee in Transportation and Infrastructure on May 16 with a bipartisan vote of 33 to 24. My good friend from California is right: When is enough time enough? My good friend from West Virginia asked: What gives us the right? What gives us the right is the Constitution. The House of Representatives. the Senate. the legislative body. to pass laws. to move things forward. 5 years is way too long. We need to develop the energy in America. We need to bring energy from our good friends from Canada. This all adds to the regulatory burden that this administration has put on us. This pipeline is the lifeline that powers nearly all of our daily activities. The hallmark of Americas 2.5 millionmile pipeline network continues to be that it delivers extraordinary volumes of product reliably. safely. efficiently. and economically. Pipelines are the safest and most costeffective means to transport the products that fuel our economy. In fact. pipelines provide more than twothirds of the energy used in the United States. The Keystone XL project will be a critical addition to this extensive network. increasing our Nations supply of oil. and thus helping to reduce the cost of fuel used in the transportation sector. H.R. 3 is a commonsense bill that allows construction. maintenance. and operation of the Keystone XL pipeline to move forward. The pipeline has been subject to extensive environmental reviews already conducted. In fact. it is the most studied pipeline in the history of America. The bill would require no Presidential permit process for the approval of the pipeline. and therefore avoids further political delays of this project. Of particular interest to taxpayers. this pipeline doesnt require one Federal dollar. Further. the very nature of infrastructure creates jobs. and the Keystone is no exception. In fact. the U.S. State Department estimates that Keystone XL will produce 42.000 jobsjobs that will not be created unless this project goes forward.
1130057304,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will submit for the RECORD an exchange of letters between the Committee on Budget. the Committee on Natural Resources. and the Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. Chairman. I am proud today that we are considering one of my highest priorities as the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure CommitteeH.R. 3080. the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013. or WRRDA. WRRDA is the most policy- and reformfocused legislation of its kind in the last two decades. The new name reflects the landmark reforms. We have added an ""R."" for Water Resources Reform and Development Act. because of the number of reforms that we have in here. It is the most fiscally responsible WRRDA in history. and there are no earmarks. It does not cede our constitutional congressional authority to the executive branch. We made sure that we maintained that. We have worked together in a bipartisan way on this bill since day one. developing this bill with input from Members and stakeholders through listening sessions. roundtables and hearings. I want to thank my partners and original cosponsors. Ranking Member RAHALL. Water Subcommittee Chairman Bor GIBBS. and also Water Subcommittee Ranking Member TIM BISHOP. for their work on this piece of legislation. I want to thank all of the members of the committee and all of the staff members for their hard work and desire to work together on this important infrastructure and reform legislation. I am also proud that WRRDA has received more than 70 letters of support from stakeholders. a list of which I will submit for the RECORD. This bill was passed out of committee on September 19 on a voice vote. It is about strengthening our infrastructure so that we can remain competitive. It is about economic growth. It is about trade. It is about jobs. not just the jobs that will be created when we are dredging ports and rebuilding locks and dams. but the jobs that will help our manufacturers when they manufacture their products and send them into the world markets. making sure they get there in a competitive way. Also. making sure that those products coming into our ports and harbors are getting onto the shelves of our local stores. allowing the consumers to buy these products at a lower cost. allowing them to keep more of their hardearned dollars. Congress has not enacted a WRRDA since 2007 and we cant afford to delay. Without improvement. our water transportation system becomes obsolete every day and we become less competitive. If we cannot compete. we lose jobs to those who can. Our bill cuts red tape. reforms the bureaucracy. accelerates project delivery. It sets hard deadlines on the time and cost of studies. It also consolidates or eliminates unnecessary studies and requires concurrent reviews. And our bill streamlines environmental reviews. I want to repeat. it streamlines them. doesnt eliminate them. but streamlines them. Our bill is also fiscally responsible. This WRRDA bill deauthorizes $12 billion of old. inactive projects that were authorized prior to this current law and fully offsets new authorizations. In addition. it sunsets new authorizations to prevent future backlogs at the Corps of Engineers. This WRRDA has no earmarks. Our bill establishes a new. transparent process for future bills to review and prioritize water resources development activities. with strong constitutional oversight and without handing over our constitutional authority to the executive branch. I want to repeat that. I think it is very important that this body. that Congress. holds on to its constitutional authority and not give it over to the executive branch. as we have done for decades. We have been recognized by leading outside watchdog groups for having a bill with no earmarks and for keeping congressional oversight without ceding that authority to the Corps. I am extremely proud of the accomplishments. and we should all be. WRRDA breaks down barriers that hold back the development of our water resources infrastructure. It maximizes the ability of nonFederal interests to contribute their own funds to move studies and projects forward. It also expands the ability of nonFederal interests to contribute funds to expedite the evaluation and processing of permits. and it establishes a publicprivate partnership program in water infrastructure. With the leadership of RODNEY DAVIS. that is in this WRRDA legislation. This bill improves our ability to compete by authorizing needed investments in Americas ports. As I mentioned. this is a jobs bill. not just construction jobs to improve our ports. but to help our manufacturers and to help Americans be able to keep more of their hardearned dollars. Our bill supports our underserved and emerging ports to also help them become more competitive. It reforms and preserves the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to better ensure those fees collected from users for these systems are utilized for their intended purposes. These are all important and necessary reforms. but at its heart WRRDA ensures that we dont lose sight of the importance of strong infrastructure and keeping us competitive in the world. Our bill supports our water transportation network to make sure that it provides the foundation for job growth and fosters a more robust economy. I ask all Members of the House. Republicans and Democrats. to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130060936,"for his work. We ""dam"" well better get prepared to increase our infrastructure spending. or we will have more problems in this country. The motion to instruct conferees is welltaken and welldrafted. Our roads. rivers. railways. and runways got a Dplus on the American Society of Engineers 2013 report card for Americas infrastructure. That is inexcusable. a Dplus on our infrastructure. It used to be the pride of our country and one of the ways that we produced jobs and took goods to market. The fact that this score was awarded to a world superpower and a leader in technological innovation is completely unacceptable. Passing WRRDA is an important step towards turning around our Nations infrastructure investment program. I was proud to work with and support our outstanding chairman. Chairman SHUSTER. and Ranking Member RAHALL when we passed the bill in both the Transportation Committee and on the House floor. Our committee understandsI think not totally. I cant speak for the whole committee. but in generalthat earmarks arent a bad thing and earmarks are something that greases the wheels that make the engine of government run and work effectively and bipartisanly. We need to bring those back to make this House work together. Democrats and Republicans. so we all have something invested for our districts. That is important. People ask about dysfunction here and people not working together. It is because everybody doesnt have some part of the pie. something for their districts that they can be proud of. We need to get that back. People need to understand that article I says this Congress is supposed to appropriate the moneys. That is why our infrastructure has weakened. That is why we have so many projects along rivers where the Corps of Engineers dont have adequate funding and direction to keep our rivers moving and moving commerce forward. WRRDA doesnt mean that just our Nations waterways. locks. and dams will be the subjects of targeted investments. which it needs to be. It means that thousands of people will be put to work on making the improvements necessary to improve the national infrastructure. The effect of sequestration on our Nations infrastructure is real. It is time to get back on track toward smart investments that make our Nation more competitive in the global marketplace. The Corps of Engineers has a backlog of authorized projects in excess of $60 billion. The Corps construction account has been reduced by $688 million since 2010. We should be doing more to build that infrastructure and create jobs. not less. According to a study by the American Society of Civil Engineers. if we dont make new investments in our new water infrastructure. we will lose $416 billion in GDP by 2020 due to increased costs and loss of work productivity. This means real loss for real American families. Madam Speaker. I think in Turkey they are probably improving their infrastructure. We should be doing the same thing here in America. Madam Speaker. It is important we do that. Without investment. the average American family would have to adjust their household income to account for a $900 squeeze as a result of rising water rates and falling personal incomes. The longer we put off investment in our Nations infrastructure. the more that investment will cost and the more people will be out of work and the more difficult it will be for our economy to get righted. I support this motion to instruct conferees today. I thank Mr. MALONEY and"
1130077088,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I was proud to introduce H.R. 4076. the Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation Act of 2014. This bipartisan legislation will provide relief for millions of Americans suffering from the current propane and home heating fuel emergency. An exceptionally cold winter has increased demand for propane. which is used for heating approximately 12 million homes in the United States. and for other homeheating fuels. In my district. more than 9.000 households rely on propane for home heating. and across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. there are more than 200.000 households that do the same. So according to the National Propane Gas Association. supplies are expected to remain tight through the end of the winter because the infrastructure to deliver propane to highdemand areas is insufficient. On February 5. the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued a temporary emergency declaration to allow tank truck operators delivering propane and other home heating fuels to drive longer hours in order to speed up deliveries to the affected States. However. these emergency declarations can only last 30 days at a time. creating great uncertainty and limited relief. Extreme weather conditions are not expected to subside any time soon. threatening the lives and livelihoods of those with homes. farms. and businesses that depend on heat from propane and other home heating fuels. Just yesterday. we saw another severe winter storm. H.R. 4076 provides a guaranteed extension of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administrations emergency declaration until May 31. 2014. This certainty is required to address the transportation distribution issues to give much needed relief to the affected States. Should the crisis subside prior to May 31. 2014. the Secretary of Transportation. in consultation with the Governors of the affected States. can determine that the guaranteed extension is no longer needed. I would like to thank the National Propane Gas Association and the New England Fuel Institute for supporting this legislation. I will be entering their letters of support into the RECORD. This bill has strong bipartisan support. and I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 4076. With that. I reserve the balance of my time. NPGA. Hon. BILL SHUSTER. Chairman. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. House of Representatives. Rayburn House Office Building. Washington. DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER. On behalf of The National Propane Gas Association (NPGA). I write to share our strong support for your legislation. H.R. 4076. the Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation (HHEATT) Act of 2014. NPGA is the national trade association of the propane industry. having a membership of about 3.000 companies. with 39 state and regional associations representing members in all 50 states. The single largest group of NPGA members is retail marketers of propane gas who deliver the fuel to the end user for space heating. water heating and agricultural crop drying. among other applications. NPGA membership also includes propane producers. transporters and wholesalers. as well as manufacturers and distributors of associated equipment and containers. While NPGAs membership covers a broad crosssection of categories. more than 90 percent are designated as small businesses. As you know. this winter Americans have faced severe supply disruptions in many areas of the country. A convergence of conditionslate wet grain harvest. closed pipeline infrastructure. limited railcars due to alternate service demandshave caused difficulties in delivering propane to consumers during one of the most extreme winters on record. While the overall supply of propane in the United States is sufficient to meet demand. the propane industry is facing challenges with distribution and transportation. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. the U.S. has more than 42 million barrels of propane presently in stock. located predominantly in Mont Belvieu. Texas. where the largest propane storage facility in the world is located. Overcoming the distribution challenges has been most greatly alleviated by temporary emergency declarations issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Administration which provide relief from certain federal motor carrier safety regulations for the Midwest. Eastern. Southern. and portions of the Western Service Centers. Unfortunately. these emergency declarations can only last 30 days at a time which creates uncertainty for our propane suppliers and distributors. Chairman Shuster. we thank you for your leadership on this bill. and trust Congress will take swift action to pass this important regulatory relief. Thank you. Sincerely.
1130083336,I thank the gentleman from California. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4005. the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014. The United States Coast Guard enforces all U.S. laws on U.S. waterways and. when necessary. on the high seas. This service saves the life and property of those who sail in our waters for recreation and commerce. They protect our marine natural resources and secure our borders against illegal drugs and against human trafficking. They have a huge job. and they deserve our thanks. H.R. 4005 provides the service with our support. This bipartisan legislation authorizes the Coast Guard to carry out all its vital missions. improves its mission effectiveness. and helps replace and modernize aging Coast Guard assets in a costeffective manner. it enhances oversight and reduces inefficiency to save taxpayer dollars. Additionally. the bill strengthens U.S. maritime transportation. reduces regulatory burdens to create jobs and encourage economic growth. and improves the Nations competitiveness. Specifically. it authorizes funding for Coast Guard activities in 2015 and 2016 at fiscally responsible levels that will allow the Coast Guard to continue updating its fleet of aging cutters and continue operations. supports Coast Guard servicemen and women. and encourages the Coast Guard to work with the private sector. it enhances Congressional oversight. improves Coast Guard acquisition activities. requires development of a national maritime strategy. creates opportunities for our veterans. and it reforms the Federal Maritime Commission. I would also like to make note. as Chairman HUNTER noted. this is our colleague HOWARD COBLES last term as a member of the Coast Guard Subcommittee. The gentleman from North Carolina has served on the subcommittee and its predecessor. the Merchant Marine Committee. since he came to Congress in 1985. He is the only former coastie now serving in Congress. I know the Coast Guard appreciates his strong support for the service. particularly during his term as subcommittee chairman on this committee. I know all the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members join me in wishing HOWARD a welldeserved and happy retirement. I want to thank and commend Subcommittee Chairman HUNTER for introducing this bill and working with Ranking Member RAHALL and also Ranking Member GARAMENDI for their work on this bill. I also will take notice that our good friend from the Virgin Islands is in the Chamber working on a couple provisions that I know are going to be very beneficial to the U.S. territories and to the U.S. Virgin Islands. I thank her for her hard work on this legislation. I look forward to working with the Senate to get the final version of this bill enacted this year.
1130115005,Mr. Chairman. I will conclude and yield myself the balance of my time. first. by thanking Mr. RAHALL for working with us to come forward with a commonsense approach to stopping another grab by the executive branch. I also want to thank Congressman STEVE SOUTHERLAND from Florida. who introduced H.R. 5078. Mr. SOUTHERLAND has been a leader on the water issue since he arrived in Congress. As we have been talking about here. and as Mr. RAHALL agrees. this proposed rule would significantly increase the geographic scope of the Federal Governments authority under the act and is outside the bounds of what can legitimately be done by the rulemaking. It also is going to create great uncertainty within the many industries in this country. The rulemaking proposed by the administration is yet another example of the disturbing pattern as this Presidency seeks to use brute force to expand executive action while ignoring Congress and the Supreme Court. I would urge all the Members. all 435 Members of this body. to look seriously at this piece of legislation and what this administration is trying to do. The President tries to grab Congress legitimate constitutional authority. And if you have any doubts on that. the Supreme Court. twice. rejected a rulemaking by the EPA. I think all 435 of us ought to be looking closely. whether it is a Republican or a Democrat administration. at these power grabs by the executive branch. It has gone on for far too long. and Congress needs to stand up and maintain its constitutional authority. This is a massive Federal jurisdiction grab. In the li0th and the 111th Congresses. there were attempts through various committees and through various amendments which were rejected on a bipartisan basis to stop this. H.R. 5078. introduced by our colleague. Mr. SOUTHERLAND. simply prevents the EPA and the Corps from finalizing the illconceived proposed rule. and directs the agencies to consult with the States and local officials. That is the way forward. going back to our States and our local governments. They care as much or more about the waters in Pennsylvania and West Virginia and California and Oregon than the EPA does. This notion in Washington that Washington has the greater concern. that Washington has the better idea. the onesizefitsall. just doesnt work. and it has been proven time and time again. So again. this stops the administration proceeding. It has a path forward. I would urge my colleagues to read all nine pages of this bill. If you get to the end. you will see there is a way forward. and that is to consult with the States and the locals to come up with a consensus rule that can result in reasonable regulatory process that protects our waters. So. with that. Mr. Chairman. I support this legislation. I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.R. 5078. and I yield back the balance of my time.
1130116929,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the McKeon amendment to train and equip vetted Syrian opposition groups and to confront the threat posed to our Nation by ISIL. ISIL are thugs. murderers. They are monsters. and they must be stopped. Their trail of destruction and slaughter of innocent men. women. and children must be stopped. ISIL has laid out their goals and their strategy. and that is to reestablish a caliphate and death to anyone who stands in their way. or. to use their motto. ""convert or die."" They must be destroyed. Now is the time for the United States to make clear our goals and our strategy. that we will not stand by idly. We will not watch and wait for the slaughtering of more innocent civilians. I am pleased that the President has finally committed to some action. It should have happened months ago. if not a year ago. The President has been timid for far too long. It is time to act. By coming together as a unified body to take this important step. we will tell the world that America stands together in opposition to global terrorism and to the monsters of ISIL. This amendment to train and equip vetted Syrian opposition groups sends a clear signal to our European allies that we are committed to eradicating ISIL and that we hope they will join us in this effort. It sends a message to moderate Arabs and Muslims in the region and around the world that we stand with them against terrorism. This amendment strengthens the Commander in Chiefs request for ensuring that Congress has oversight and greater transparency. which is our constitutional duty. We must do all we can on every front to ensure these killers do not gain one more inch of ground in their pursuit of a terrorist state. With this amendment. we send a firm message that America is not going to allow this cancer to spread. Congress must act now. For that reason. I strongly support this amendment. and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ""yes"" to send a clear. strong. overwhelming message that a bipartisan Congress stands with the President to defeat ISIL and all evil everywhere."
1130119503,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 5682. to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Pipelines are the energy lifelines that power nearly all of our daily activities. Pipelines are a very safe and costeffective means to transport the products that fuel our economy. In fact. pipelines today supply more than twothirds of the energy used in the United States. The Keystone XL project will be a critical addition to this extensive network. increasing our Nations supply of oil and. thus. helping to reduce the cost of oil. H.R. 5682 closely follows H.R. 3 that this House passed last year. Since the passage of H.R. 3. the State Department completed its Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on January 31 of 2014. However. there has still been no action by the administration on the pipeline. There have been excuses. the most recent of which is pending litigation in the State of Nebraska. However. H.R. 5682 takes that into account and allows for the rerouting in that State. There is simply no further reason to delay this important project. especially given the numerous benefits it will provide our Nation. This pipeline will be a boon to economic development. Of particular interest to taxpayers. this pipeline doesnt require one Federal dollar to build. Further. the very nature of infrastructure creates jobs. and the Keystone XL is no exception. The U.S. State Department reconfirmed all of this last January. The State estimated that the Keystone XL will produce 42.000 jobs and $2 billion in employee earnings. This project will have a significant positive economic impact. including an estimated $3.1 billion in construction contracts. materials. and support services. Furthermore. the State confirmed that the estimated total property taxes for the project will be over $55 million spread across 27 counties. The State Department called this impact ""substantial for many counties."" The Keystone XL pipeline is the most extensively studied and vetted pipeline project in the history of this country. The project will include 95 special mitigation measures. including 59 recommended by PHMSA. to prevent spills and to make this the safest pipeline ever built. In fact. I would argue that we are facing a manufactured stalemate. one that could be described as ""paralysis by analysis."" The majority of Americans knows this is the right thing to do. so the Congress. through this bill. will lead where the President has refused. This project will create jobs. improve the Nations economy. strengthen our transportation system. and help improve the Nations economic security. I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130122992,I was more than happy to let Mr. COBLE come up. He didnt have to thank me. His hard work is thanks enough. But. again. a fine member of the committee and a Member of Congress. We are going to miss him greatly. So. again. as I want to sum up. Chairman HUNTER. Ranking Member GARAMENDI. great work on this bill. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this. and hopefully we will get a vote in the Senate next week. and we can get this to the Presidents desk and he can sign it for Christmas. So. again. thanks to all. I want to thank the staff for their great work. not only on the subcommittee but on the full committee. As we worked through the past 2 years. the staff has had a lot of good action together. and I want to thank the staff and wish them a Merry Christmas. a happy holiday. and a happy new year. If we dont see you. then we will see you around the first of the year. I am particularly pleased that the bill includes a provision which equalizes the regulatory treatment among similar vessels which operate out of the British and U.S. Virgin Islands. Current law puts certain vessels operating out of the U.S. Virgin Islands at a competitive disadvantage with similar vessels operating out of the British Virgin Islands. H.R. 5769 establishes an equal playing field for these vessels. It allows vessels operating out of the U.S. Virgin Islands which meet safety requirements identical to those in effect for similar vessels operating out of the British Virgin Islands to carry an equal number of passengers. It is clear the provision comes into effect on the date of enactment. The Coast Guard may write standards to implement the provision. but. again. the provision is clear. any such standards must be identical to those imposed on BVI vessels. and during any period prior to the implementation of such standards. vessels operating out of the U.S. Virgin Islands which meet the standards referenced in section 319. uninspected passenger vessels in the United States Virgin Islands. of H.R. 5769 shall be allowed to carry an equal number of passengers as those operating out of the British Virgin Islands.

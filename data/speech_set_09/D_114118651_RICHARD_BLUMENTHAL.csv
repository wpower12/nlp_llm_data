1140021512,Mr. President. I thank Senator CARPER and Senator DURBIN. two of our most distinguished colleagues who have fought ceaselessly for the interests of students and veterans. I am very proud to be here with them today. I do have a very personal interest as the dad of a veteran and also of a currently serving young man whom I hope will be a veteran one day. Nothing is more important than this issue of making sure we keep faith with our veterans and protect them because the phenomena we have described today often create incentives for schools to lure veterans into education deals. and they are often education deals that fail them. that dont make sense for them. that dont give them the education and the qualifications they think they are going to receive. So very often they are failed by these programs. and they fail to complete their courses and leave with mountains of debt but no degree. These kinds of abuses that bring us here today involve some forprofit schools in effect scamming our Nations veterans. We all know that forprofit schools are prohibited from receiving more than 90 percent of their total revenue from Federal student aid. but. as my colleagues have so well stated. the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration education benefits are not counted toward that 90 percent. That loophole causes the forprofits to target those servicemembers and veterans. often with predatory marketing practices that lure them into those deals that make no sense for them. We need to change that law. We need to change the law so that DOD and VA benefits count under the 90percent cap on Federal revenue. That is really our ultimate goal. I thank the President for including such a provision in his budget request for fiscal year 2016. I look forward to working with my colleagues and with the President in moving that legislative effort forward. In the meantime. we need a more accurate picture of this problem because when it comes to forprofit schools and veterans. there are some things we definitely need to know and our veterans need to know. Here is what we do know. We know there are a large number of forprofit schools that would be in violation of the 9010 rule if we made this change today. In fact. a 2013 Department of Education analysis identified 133 forprofit schools that would be in violation. We also know that the current loophole in that 9010 rule creates those incentives for certain institu tions to conduct aggressive. relentless. often predatory recruitment of veterans. What we lack and what we need is comprehensive. complete information on the exact scope of the problem. That part should be easy. The Department of Education already collects the information we are asking them to publish. It is a simple task of publishing how much revenue schools receive from all Federal education programs. including the DOD and the VA. That would bring accuracy and transparency to the debate over the 9010 rule. Disclosure and transparency are part of the battle. Most importantly. this information and these statistics would provide veterans themselves and servicemembers better data and information to make informed choices about higher education. Let me briefly mention another tool that I think is very important because it encourages veterans to make informed higher education choices. and that is the VAs GI bill comparison tool. I am gladand I thank Secretary McDonaldthe VA has launched this vitally important resource for veterans in response to the Presidents Executive order. which established principles of excellence for schools that serve veterans. I also think Secretary McDonald can take steps to improve this tool. specifically by adding a risk index that would highlight unscrupulous bad actors in the industry. As our Nations veterans decide where to spend their taxpayerfunded education benefitstheir money but taxpayer fundedthey deserve to know if the school they are considering is under investigation for deceptive practices. what its record is on this score. what its graduates do. what the value is of education and courses there. They deserve to know if the school they are considering has been placed on heightened cash monitoring status. a specific status from the Department of Education. They deserve to have this information. It is vital not only to them but to their smart use of taxpayer dollars. Let me finish by saying that forprofit schools have been problematic in many ways. The Committee on Health. Education. Labor and Pensions. on which I served during my first 2 years. conducted an investigation. I was very proud to be a part of the effort to reform forprofit schools. Our former colleague Tom Harkin worked very hard on this issue. We should not tar every forprofit school with too broad a brush. We should note improvements that have been made. This problem is discrete. identifiable. critically important. and I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to talk about it and work with them on it.
1140024408,"Madam President. spring in Washington. DC. is one of the most beautiful times of the year. as it is in Connecticut and around the country. We have endured a tough winter in the Northeasta lot of snow and a lot of cold. And now a lot of potholes are all around the country. Spring means potholes. which are endemic not only to the Northeast but to our roads all around America. Potholes are just the latest reminder of infrastructure challenges facing our Nation. That is one reason why this week is. in fact. Infrastructure Week. a time when we should be focusing on rail and roads. the decaying and aging infrastructure that bedevils and hobbles our Nation as we seek to compete globally. And our businesses in Connecticut seek to compete nationally as well as globally. This time of year is also the beginning of the construction season. especially in the colder regions of the country. such as the Northeast and Iowa. Nebraska. and the Midwest. In Connecticut. construction workers are ready to go. ready to take advantage of this chance to address our aging and decaying transportation assets. I know that trade is on our agenda this week. I urge and implore that trade be set aside. that the trade bill be delayednot forever. by any means. As the leader of our caucus has urgedour leader HARRY REID has implored that we focus on infrastructure. We face a deadline. May marks the last month of MAP21. the law governing surface transportation funding. On May 31just 20 days from nowthe authorization governing our highway trust fund will expire. That is right. There is a highway cliff that we are just days away from going over. This Nation will go over that cliff unless we act. and now is the moment. Now is the time. Now is our opportunity. and it is an opportunity that will not excuse us from acting. The bill covers more than just funding. It is crucial to keeping our roadways safe. Now. 2014 was a record year for auto recalls. auto problems. and issues. So part of what needs to be done in addressing the expiration of MAP21 is to make safety a priority. But it cannot be achieved if we dont address the fundamental challenges of our aging infrastructure. Fundamental reforms are needed at the NHTSA and other safety watchdogs to make sure our constituents are safe. So one would think now would be the time to discuss legislation that would fix our streets and stop potholes from imperiling our drivers and put construction workers back on the job. providing a lifeline to nearly 2 million Americans who have jobs directly tied to the transportation sector. One would think we would want to cut down on our unemployment. In the construction sector. joblessness remains at a 10percent level. You would think that now is the time to be advancing a multiyear. longterm bill that will provide certainty to States and municipalities so they can finalize planning for longterm projects. You would think that now is the time to take a hard look at our safety oversight agenciesNHTSA. the FRA. the Federal Highway Administrationand to make reforms and increase the tools that they have in fines and penalties they can exact to protect all who rely on our transportation network. Unfortunately. the approach of this Congress is going to be. as engineers say. patch and pray. Patch the potholes. patch the roads. patch the railroadseven when the tracks are cracked. even when ballasts are failing. Patch the bridges. Patch and pray. We are about to become a nation of patch and pray when it comes to decaying. deficient roads. bridges. railroads. and all the vital nuts and bolts. literally. that transport our Nation. How ironic it is at this momentwhen it is spring. when the construction industry is about to rely on the opportunities it has to put people back to work. and when many of us in this Chamber and others at school commencements will be talking about the big ideas. the big challenges. the big dreams and hopes that our graduates have for the futurethat we are thinking small. We are thinking about patchingpatching our highway transit fund for months. maybe until the end of the year. A nation that patches and prays cannot be exceptional. cannot be a great nation when it comes to shortchanging investments in the vital facilities. in the nuts and bolts. in the roads and bridges that make it a national competitor. This kind of shortterm extension of a highway and transit system fails to match the challenges that our Nation faces. We spend less and invest less as a percentage of our gross domestic product than many other industrialized nations. Europe and China spend far more as a percentage of their gross domestic product than we do. So I call on the leadership. my good friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle. to make infrastructure our priority for this week. as it should be for this decade. Within this decade. according to some projections. one in four of our bridges will be 65 years or older. making them even more prone to decay and disrepair. The consequences are real and costly. Bridges collapse. such as the 50year old Skagit River Bridge in Washington. The bridge collapsed sending cars into the river below. That wasnt a remote bridge. It was over Interstate 5. a major artery on the west coast. Of course. we all remember the 2007 bridge collapse in Minneapolis. We remember the Mianus River Bridge collapse in Connecticut. the Bridgeport derailment due to decaying and cracking tracks that were improperly repaired. We remember where lives were lost because of a derailment and the failure to invest in train communication and signaling that could have prevented that tragedy. We remember the railroad grade crossings where insufficient investment in modern technology causes deaths all around the countryhundreds of them every yearnot to mention billions of dollars due to these collisions. derailments. crashes on the roads. costing lives and imperiling our Nations future. A shortterm patch robs our States and municipalities of the certainty they need to contract what is essential to construction at the lowest possible cost in the most efficient way. The certainty and reliability in funding are essential to our municipalities. knowing what their resources will be not just this year but into the future and driving the bargaining with contractors and subcontractors. It is not just because of our rebuilding needs that we need this investment. There are also many other significant related issues that we must address to keep our roads and bridges safe and reliable. We need to ensure that trucks on the road arent too big. that truck drivers have enough rest. that our railroads are properly overseen. that constant train control is implemented. that testing for physical and emotional problems is done regularly and reliably. And the long list of NTSB regulations needs to be finally addressed and implemented. We are in a time when we are talking to young men and women as they graduate from school about those big ideas and about their futures and dreams. when we invoke what is best and brightest about America. our foresight. our strength. our courage to take risks. to invest in ourselves and our future. It is the same spirit that led to the building of the Erie Canal. the transcontinental railroad. and the interstate highway system. Those initiatives were not partisan initiatives. The greatest generation came back from World War II and built the interstate highways under the leadership of President Dwight Eisenhower. He was committed to making America one Nation in its roads. tying us and binding us together as a Nation through that investment. He had the courageas we should todayto say that what is great about America is what we give back. what we are willing to investnot only for today. but for tomorrow. And we are in danger today in this Chamber. in this Nation. of being one of the first generations that left a lesser America for our children. Think of ita lesser America at a time when the words ""exceptional"" and ""exceptionalism"" trip off the tongues of many of our colleagues here in the Chamber. We need to match that rhetoric with real action. So today. let us resolve that we will debate and act on a longterm investment program to make sure that our roads and bridges. our railroads and airports. and the ports that could make our Nation the envy of the world are matching our rhetoric and our goals. that they truly make us competitive for businesses in Connecticut and around the Nation. competitive on the global scene. where competition has never been tougher and where our infrastructure needs to be better. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140035516,Mr. President. tomorrow we will vote on a very important amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. the Military Justice Improvement Act. introduced by my colleague and friend. the junior Senator from the State of New York. I have worked with her and have been privileged to help craft this very important legislative measure. not because sexual assault is a uniquely military problemin fact. just the contrary. Sexual assault afflicts our campuses and our workplaces. The battle against sexual assault is hardly limited to the military. But we have the opportunity to take a step that will set a model and send a message to other places where sexual assault is a problem and where underreporting. because of lack of trust and confidence in the prosecutorial system or the administrative apparatus. is a major reason that sexual assault continues. Without confidence. trust. effective results. and protection of privacy and physical safety. survivors will simply not come forward. If they do not come forward. there will be no discipline or prosecution. That is the fundamental reason why I believe the amendment we will address tomorrow is so important. I have held roundtables on campus sexual assault all around the State of Connecticutmore than 12 or 13 of themand have worked with a bipartisan group of Senators. including not only Senator GILLIBRAND. who is the major sponsor of this amendment. but also Senator MCCASKILL. who has been an extraordinary leader in this area having been a prosecutor herself. and Senator HELLER as well as others on both sides of the aisle. to devise a solution to campus sexual assaultnot just a single panacea but a set of measures that addresses one of the major obstacles to effective action against campus sexual assault. which is the underreporting of this heinous. horrific crime. It is a crime wherever it occurs. whether in the military or on campus. That is why we have to combat and conquer it. just as we do an enemy who preys on our men or women in uniform or on campuses or elsewhere. We went through this debate last year. We reached a solution last year. which we hoped would. in fact. be a solution. But the simple. plain fact is that this insidious. pernicious epidemic of sexual assault in the military continues unabated or at least unreduced by the amount that we should regard as minimum for judging this supposed solution a success. The fact is that the Department of Defenses own research shows that 52 unwanted sexual contacts occur every day on average across the military. That is the same rate it was 5 years ago in 2010. The fact is that in fiscal year 2014. the Department of Defense estimates 62 percent of servicewomen experienced retaliation for coming forward. the same percentage as 2012. Servicemembers who report assault are 12 times more likely to experience retaliation for reporting their cases than seeing the assailant convicted of a crime. Retaliation is more likely than effective discipline or punishment against the perpetrator. The amendment we have offered. the Military Justice Improvement Act. seeks to address this issue through explicit codification of punishment for any personany persondeciding to retaliate against anyone who reports this crime of sexual assault. Explicit punishment for retaliation will not only send a message. but it will deter what is in civilian terms one of the most severe crimes. known as obstruction of justice. The reason why retaliation or obstruction of justice is so insidious is it prevents the justice system from reaching a just result. It not only deters victims and survivors from coming forward regardless of the crime. it also permits perpetrators and criminals to go free and feel they can again commit the crime of sexual assault or other crimes. But in the case of sexual assault. it is particularly pernicious because we know also from statistics that this crime is recommitted. There is recidivism at a higher rate than many others. A large proportion of sexual assaults is committed by a very tiny fraction of members of the military. What happens. in effect. on campuses or in the military is there are serial rapists. serial perpetrators of sexual assault. If they feel they can do it without consequences. they will continue to commit this crime. We have learned from many survivors that the anxiety to come forward stems not only from the fear of retaliation but from the bias and inherent conflict of interest entrenched in the chain of command. The fact is that the Department of Defense estimates that 60 percent of cases involve a supervisor or a unit leader. Think of that number60 percent of cases involving alleged sexual assault are committed by the supervisor or the unit leader in the U.S. military.
1140047463,Madam President. even in the greatest deliberative body in this Nation and likely the world. there are moments of profound sadness and regret. and this moment is one for me. I am deeply dismayed that the Republican leadership is engaging in an effortan effort doomed to fail in just a couple of hoursto defund probably the most trusted provider of health care for women in the United States of America. It is misguided because there are so many significant issues that should be front and center for this body: making sure that we invest in our roads and bridges. making sure that we improve our education system. making sure that we keep faith with our veterans. So many of them are going nowhere because of this partisan paralysis and gridlock. Dismayingly to the American people. that has prevented real action. I regret that we are. in effect. distracted from those goals and those missions that the American people expect us to fulfill. Once again. many of my colleagues across the aisle have aligned themselves with the most extreme of the antichoice movement to undermine access to critical health care services for womenfor millions of women in this country and thousands in Connecticut who depend on Planned Parenthood for basic health care screenings. cancer diagnosis. family planning. and contraception services. which distinguish it as one of the most trusted health care providers in the United States. It is the Republican leadershipnot just a few Senators but the Republican leadershipthat has set up this vote to defund Planned Parenthood. So instead of the Senate moving forward to provide additional health care services to women. it has engaged in this onslaught and assault on womens health care. taking a step back with legislation that is reallylet me say bluntlya political charade. a stunt. a bill or legislative measure that will go nowhere and is as much a sham for the supporters as it is for opponents. The fact is Planned Parenthood provides health care services to women across this country. Only 3 percent of its activity relates to abortion. So 97 percent of what it does is to provide screenings. diagnosis. and family planning. If this measure goes through. millions of women will be undiagnosed with cervical and breast cancer. millions of women will be denied access to contraception and family planning. and millions of young women will be denied the kind of education they need to prevent pregnancy. It is in preventing pregnancy that so often Planned Parenthood is engaged. and to make it safe. legal. and rare. Eliminating $528 million from the largest womens health care provider in the country would create a public health crisis. Pure and simple. a public health crisis would be the inevitable consequence of this measure to defund Planned Parenthood. Of the 2.7 million women Planned Parenthood serves every year. 78 percent are lowincome women who depend on Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screening. testing for sexually transmitted infections. hepatitis B vaccines. family planning counseling. education on how to recognize and leave abusive relationships. domestic violence. referrals to other medical specialists. and many other essential services that would be unaffordable and inaccessible without Planned Parenthood. Over half of Planned Parenthoods clinics serve women in medically underserved areas or in health provider shortage areas. So 13 of Connecticuts 17 womens health centers serve women in rural or medically underserved parts of my State. Defunding Planned Parenthood would mean 64.000 of my constituents could lose access to quality health services. Because there is no network of health care providers with the capacity to serve this population if Planned Parenthood is denied funding. millions of womenparticularly Medicaid recipientswould lose access to quality health services. and the result would be a public health crisis. That is the stark reality of these numbers and statistics. Dry and abstract as they are. they stand for reallife consequencesreal women whose lives will be inevitably transformed for the worse if this measure were to pass. Beyond the din of this place that so often consumes usthe confusion and the noisethere are real people whose lives will be affected by these kinds of measures and whose lives are affected even by the effort to defund Planned Parenthood because of the uncertainty and doubt that it creates. These real people are women such as Elizabeth A.. who said: When I didnt have health insurance 3 years ago. I went to Planned Parenthood where I had access to safe. affordable. reproductive health care. I still go there for my health needs! I was able to get STD testing and birth control when I couldnt afford it anywhere else. Rachel S. of Naugatuck. CT: Birth control helped my husband and me put off having a family until we were financially ready to care for a child. The effects of pregnancy. both physically and financially. mean that free or lowcost birth control is an important factor in a successful future for both the woman and her family. And Nicole B. of West Haven. CT: I come to Planned Parenthood because it is a safe place to get birth control and exams. Everyone is helpful and nonjudgmental. The city needs a place like this and many women benefit from Planned Parenthood services. These stories are from real people whose lives we in the Senate are supposed to care about. I care about them because I know so many women whose lives have been affected by Planned Parenthood. I know so many of the staff and dedicated professionals who work at Planned Parenthood clinics. One spoke to me on Saturday afternoonone of the low points last week during the controversy that has enveloped Planned Parenthoodabout how she was inspired and revived by simply passing by a room where one of the counselors was talking to a group of young people. both men and women. about the education that was important to them as far as preventing unwanted pregnancy and how seeing Planned Parenthood at work in that settingthe real work of providing health care and educationinspired her to keep going despite those difficulties. The fact is that over and over my constituents. the people of Connecticut. have told me they choose Planned Parenthood because of the professionalism. dedication. and nonjudgmental approach to their patients. Many view Planned Parenthood as a safe space to come when they need advice. when they need medical examinations. If Republicans succeed in defunding it. women will be without their most trusted health care provider. So many of them are relying on it because it is trustworthy. professional. and dedicated to themfirst and foremost to them. Today I stand with Planned Parenthood and the thousands and thousands of women in Connecticut and around the country who benefited from their services. I will vehemently oppose these efforts to allow a secretive and dishonest group to discredit and to dismay so many. They have manipulated the facts. put employees and volunteers in danger. and have eliminated the organizations ability to provide essential services. But the important point is that we resist this effort today to defund an organization that has provided so many services to so many people in need and has enabled this Nation to avert a public health crisis that will ensue if we follow this misguided effort. and that we follow our better instincts and make sure that we keep the faith with women who need health care in this Nation. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1140056374,Mr. President. reserving the right to object. I respect deeply and in fact support the arguments made by my colleague from Florida. There are goals here to be served. and I strongly support them as well. Accountability has been lacking for too long in the Department of Veterans Affairs. That is a simple fact on which we can all agree. In fact. we took a major step in the right direction with the passage of the access and accountability act during the last session with bipartisan support. I would support this measure if a number of simple changes were made to it to comply with the Constitution. This measure lacks some of the basic constitutional guarantees that again and again the Supreme Court of the United States has said are absolutely mandatory. This bill. unfortunately. fails to provide sufficient notice in advance of any firing or disciplinary action. a statement of cause. a right to be heard. and an opportunity for basic administrative constitutional guarantees. I commit to work with my colleague from Florida on seeking to improve this bill. In fact. I have proposed a measure that is now pending in the Committee on Veterans Affairs. S. 1856. which will improve the management of the VA in many of the same ways. but it avoids these constitutional pitfalls. As a former attorney general. I care deeply about enforcement. which is to say effective enforcement. A disciplinary action now under appeal in the Federal circuit will decide the constitutionality of exactly these procedures. In the meantime. we ought to avoid creating unnecessary litigation and challenge to a law that should be enforced effectively. This one. unfortunately. cannot be. I believe strongly there are measures and ways to achieve greater accountability. It isnt a luxury or convenience. it is a necessity that the VA is held accountable. The more effective way to hold the VA accountable is to pass a measure that is fully constitutional and. in addition. provides more effective protection for whistleblowers. They are the ones who come forward speaking truth to power. They are the ones with critical facts necessary for accountability. This measure. unfortunately. fails to afford sufficient protection for those whistleblowers. Therefore. I object.
1140067576,"Mr. President. we talk in this Chamber every day about the threat of terrorism and many associated terrorist threats with airplanes and explosives. but we have seen in recent horrifying events in Paris and in San Bernardino how much tragic carnage can be wrought by a small number of people using firearms designed for war. They are using assault weapons that have the purpose to kill and maim human beingsno other purpose. For me and for the American people. common sense says a person too dangerous to be permitted on a plane is too dangerous to be permitted a gun. No fly. no gun. No check. no gun. That ought to be the rule. It is a commonsense rule. When I talk to people in Connecticut and they say to me ""Why didnt the Senate approve that rule?"" there is no commonsense explanation. The reason given by colleagues on the other side that there is some due process violation is nonsense. I hesitate to say it is that frivolous. but it is because. No. 1. there is a right to challenge the designation on the nofly list through the Department of Homeland Security. which has to provide reasons and an opportunity to challenge it. Also. under Senator FEINSTEINs bill. there is an additional safeguard to constitutional rights because it can be challenged through the Department of Justice. which is required to establish an administrative process and then an appeala right of appeal to the Federal courts. Anybody denied permission to buy a gun has a right of appeal. So the rule nofly. no gun is based on common sense and legal. constitutional rights. No right. in fact. is absolute. Whether it is the First Amendment or any other right. there is the guarantee in the Constitution that there will be reasonable restrictions. when necessary. to protect the public interests. and here is a case of the public interests clearly deserving this protection. If there are problems with any individual being on the list. challenge it. but clearly having to wait 72 hours for that check and for the denial of permission to go forward is unreasonable. I urge that we move forward with this commonsense protection for the public. I am hardpressed to think of a more clear and staggering example of the gun lobbys influence than the defeat of this bill. Plainly. the vote last week showed that the gun lobby unfortunately still has a staggering stranglehold on this process. When it comes to law enforcement. they are on our side. I urge our colleagues to heed this reasonable request: No fly. no gun. If you are on that nofly list. if you are too dangerous to fly and to board a plane. the Constitution says this reasonable restriction should be adopted."
1140080915,"They have shown by their actions they are willing to not only talk the talk but actually walk the walk. I participated with Mayor Ganim over the weekend in a public press conference. noting the truly extraordinary and excellent work by their drug task force to stop. apprehend. arrest. and prosecute a major drug ring in the city of Bridgeport. I have talked to Mayor OLeary about efforts in Waterbury and throughout his regiona very responsible and effective action he took as police chief of Waterburybut we know we are not going to arrest our way out of this crisis. Law enforcement needs more effective support and resources. There is no way around the need for supporting and enhancing the operations of our local. State. and Federal law enforcement officialsin fact. increasing the partnership and cooperation among them. as was so dramatically shown by the successful law enforcement in the city of Bridgeport against this drug ring last week. All have a role and all of their cooperation is necessary. All of us have a responsibility to support their work. but the bill before us also recognizes that we are not going to arrest or jail our way out of this crisis. In fact. it provides resources for treatment and services and a more effective means of delivering Narcan. which can literally be a lifesaver. bringing overdose victims back from the brink of death. What I have heard in roundtables I have conducted around the State of Connecticut is the need for those additional steps. not focusing on any one of them but a multifaceted effort. as this bill reflects. In the roundtables I have conducted. I have heard from law enforcement professionals. first responders. doctors. addiction specialists. elected officials. and many others. including recovering addicts and their families. Their stories are riveting and heartbreaking about the effects of addiction. beginning with powerful prescription painkillers for routine surgery. broken ankles or wrists. and wisdom teeth that have been removed. There was overprescription of 20 pills. 30 pills. when 2 pills or 3 pills would have been sufficient. and those pills are the gateway to more serious addiction or they find their way onto the street where they fuel the addiction of others and lead to addiction to heroin. which often is cheaper than the prescription pills. Those stories I have heard from around our State. stories from people struggling with addiction or who have lost a loved one to this disease. add to the public record that exists. That record includes a story that appeared within the past week or so in the New London Day. It talks about two childhood friends. Nat and Joe. Both of them struggled with heroin addiction. but they are now in recovery. Between them. they have lost several friends. a former girlfriend. and a stepbrother to overdoses. and each has a sibling who has also become an addict. Nat is now 27 and the father of two. He said: I started taking pills when I was 19 or 20 and was stressed out when I was going through a custody battle over my son. Somebody said to try one. and then I was taking them a couple of times a week and then every day I was buying off the street. It was out of control. It got so that I couldnt work without drugs. The same happened to Nats friend Joe with Percocet. He described how he took a few pills. liked the feeling. and rapidly began to take drugs with other friends. including OxyContin and heroin. Another article in the Waterbury Republican American told the story of Thomas Obst. who was prescribed OxyContin for an eye injury. When he later suffered from withdrawal symptoms. he turned to heroin to keep himself from suffering. He explained: You never know what a street drug is mixed with. but its less expensive . . . someone mentioned heroin. I thought I could control it. Thomas eventually overdosed. but his life was saved by a brave State Trooper named Josh Sawyer. who was able to administer naloxone. This drug can be a lifesaver if it is available to policeas it was in this instanceand first responders and firefighters. Unfortunately. its price has skyrocketed. and it is increasingly in short supply. These stories from Connecticut are hardly unique. Our colleagues know they are happening in their communities. They know overdose deaths are skyrocketing. that addiction is increasing. and that the toll taken on their States and our communities is absolutely horrendous. During our roundtable in Bridgeport last Friday. a manager of the Bridgeport Recovery Community Center explained the obstacles that people afflicted with addiction face in trying to obtain treatment this way: Insurers will dictate what they will and will not pay for. You have to continually prove that this person is allowed to stay. You must make daily phone calls to plead your case. When treatment is made available. there should be no wrong door. there should be no harassing need to demonstrate the problem and the need for treatment. We need more availability of insurance and increasing recognition that addiction is not a stigma. it is an affliction. a disease. every bit as much so as any other disease. And supplies of the drugs that can help treat that addictionSUBOXONE. for examplehave to be made available. The legislation before us would provide more treatment. more beds. but it is only a down payment. only a beginning. There is truly a need for recognition that we face a public health hurricane and that this crisis. a spreading epidemic. will only become worse if we fail to provide more assistance. This bill strengthens State programs like Connecticuts that are already in place. including State prescription drug monitoring programs as well as training for law enforcement and emergency responders in the use of Narcan. It provides important recovery support services for those struggling with addiction. and it would strengthen existing Federal programs. such as the DEAs drug takeback program. The bill also provides more support for substance abuse treatment services for incarcerated individuals. We know a lot of people in prison today are there because of their addiction. If they are to emerge successfully from incarceration. they need that support and assistance to break the grip of addiction. As important as this bill is. I agree with many of my colleaguesand they have spoken on the floorthat it is far less effective than it could be without the $600 million supplemental appropriations that I have advocated and fought to pass. I am disappointed the amendment of Senator SHAHEEN. which I spearheaded and cosponsored. was not included in this measure. and I look forward to continuing to fight for the resources necessary to make this fight real. I want to thank all of my colleagues. including Senator WHITEHOUSE and others. for incorporating a bipartisan provision I wrote with Senator COATS called the Expanding Access to Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs Act. This provision will allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants to access the information they need. Specifically. they would be able to access State prescription drug monitoring programs to consult a patients prescription opioid history and thereby determine if a patient has a history of addiction or receiving multiple prescriptions from multiple sources. I know from my decade and a half of work in this area how doctor shopping and other abuses can in fact exacerbate this problem of addiction and prescription drug abuse. Although nurse practitioners and physician assistants wrote over 7 million opioid prescriptions in 2013. few States permit them to consult and submit prescribing data to these important State databases. Allowing these providers to access more information about patient history enables them to address potential addiction beforeand I stress ""before""-it becomes a serious problem. I hope this body will adopt a number of other amendments that I have proposed. including the one Senator MARKEY and I have spearheaded. amendment No. 3382. prescriber education. Prescriber education is crucial. In a roundtable I held at the Yale medical school. a number of the does told me that nowonly recentlyare there sufficient education and training and specific courses devoted to pain management and prescription discipline. Many doctors now lack that education. and our amendment would require that training as a condition for continuedMr. President. I ask unanimous consent for a few more minutes."
1140088003,"Mr. President. we have a great opportunity in the Senate to recognize and reconfirm an extraordinarily distinguished and dedicated public servant who happens to be from West Hartford. CT. Jessica Rosenworcel of the Federal Communications Commission. I understand there was an agreement as part of the approval of Commissioner ORielly and that Michael ORielly. in fact. was reconfirmed as part of a very unusual request that there be that agreement. The President renominated Ms. Rosenworcel for a new 5year term in 2015. and she was easily and unanimously confirmed by the Commerce Committee. I think we ought to keep that agreement in the Senate. that anyone a party to that agreement when the Democratic leader. Senator REID. agreed to reconfirm Republican FCC Commissioner Michael ORiellythat we ought to move forward. But apart from the politics and the internal agreements that may have been reachedand they deserve to be honoredCommissioner Rosenworcel is supremely well qualified. and she is needed on the Commission. which is sorely in need of her expertise and experience in specific areas. Let me give just a few examples. No. 1. as an example of her leadership. she led the effort to provide for writing rules that will enable enforcement of the 9111 locating standards for all 9/11 services across the country. The GPS location services require those rules. She has written standards and will enable those standards to become the guiding light for all 9111 services. That is important in cases of emergency. It is important in cases of physical and emotional trauma or crashesan accident. It is important in cases of opioid or heroin overdoses. which are becoming increasingly prevalent across the country. In fact. in Connecticut and. my guess. Oklahoma and all across the country. there is an epidemic of opioid and heroin addiction tragically taking a toll in deaths and financial costs. When there are overdoses. the administration of Narcan or naloxone within a limited period of time may be the difference between life and death and. in fact. can bring people back from the brink of death. Those types of location standards will help emergency responders go to the places they are needed. The standards applied to the 9111 services that enable the first responders to go to those places are a result of the work that Commissioner Rosenworcel has done on the FCC. That is only one example of the kind of work she has done. She has been outspoken on the cruel struggle faced by students left out of the broadband revolution. as countless are in areas that have no Internet access at home and face obstacles. literally. to complete homework they are given at school and to apply for scholarships they need financially. Today. roughly 7 in 10 teachers assign homework that requires access to broadband. but the data from the FCC suggests that almost 1 in 3 households lacks subscriptions to broadband services. They simply do not subscribe to those services at any speed with any server due to lack of affordability and. frankly. lack of interest. Ms. Rosenworcel has made this ""homework gap""-a term. by the way. that she coinedone of her top priorities and has pushed all of us to think creatively to provide all students with the connectivity they need for a fair chance to succeed. That is really the American dreama fair chance to succeed. closing the gap that results from this lack of access to the Internet. which in turn creates a homework gap and a scholarship gap and generally deprives those students of a fair chance. As Commissioner. Ms. Rosenworcel has visited schools across the country in Alaska. Arkansas. Colorado. and many more and witnessed how the Internet can support greater learning opportunities and also how limited broadband capacity prevents students from developing the skills essential for them to compete in the global. digital economy. Drawing from these experiences and her experience in the Senate working on this program. she called for an ERate 2.0 to ensure that the ERate Program is reinvigorated to meet the future connectivity needs for libraries and schools through stronger broadband capacity standards and robust funding. That robust funding is an investment this Nation needs to make. She is continuing the legacy of Senator Rockefeller to fight for strong public safety. not only on the FCC 9/11 rules. which keep communities safe and provide emergency responders the ability they need to go to places where there are overdoses or other health emergencies. but she has also worked on a bipartisan policy. a spectrum policy leading the FCC to raise recordbreaking amounts in the last years wireless spectrum auction and ensuring that there is more than enough to fully fund FirstNet. the nationwide interoperability network for public safety officials to communicate during emergencies. She has taken her own timeand she has a young familyon multiple occasions when she is back home in Connecticut to join me in helping to educate wireless customers and consumers on what they can do to avoid crammingthose are the charges on phone bills that consumers never consent to and never know about in many instancesand where they can go to seek refunds when they are victims of these kinds of cramming scams. She has been a champion of consumer interest on cramming refunds. on preventing cramming. and on helping to reach wise and prudent settlements with the carriers. She has joined me to call on telephone companies to offer consumers new tools to block robocalls. What I findand it is a relevant point during the campaign season in which we find ourselvesis that voters. consumers. residents. people from all walks of life in both parties. and a lot with no party at all. deeply resent the robocalling we see so often. Those robocalls come from commercial interests and sometimes from political interests. I approve banning robocalls. Whether or not we agree to ban them. consumers ought to have the ability to block them if they choose to. That is the cause she has championed with me. I deeply respect her commitment to consumer interests. She is widely acknowledged for her keen judgment and insight on all these issues. advancing smart telecommunications policy for the public benefit. She is a graduate of Wesleyan University and New York University Law School. Her career has been about telecommunications law. which included time as senior communications counsel for the Senate Commerce Committee under the leadership of both Senator Rockefeller and Senator Inouye. In her time on the Commission. she has been a champion of consumers. students. emergency responders. of everyday working men and women who deserve the best system and protection of their interests when it comes to telecommunications. There was an agreement that ought to be respected. but as important or even more important than an agreement. she deserves and the country needs for her to serve as a Commissioner. I urge my colleagues to reconfirm her swiftly and overwhelmingly so that she can continue to do this vital and important work she has been doing. Thank you. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1140103684,"Mr. President. I strongly agree with colleagues who have supported effective. real measures to confront the spreading toll that Zika is taking around the world and. I assume. will take an even greater number and magnitude in this country. But we need effective solutions that will provide funding for research. eradication of mosquitoes. and education of the public without harmful restrictions that prevent women from seeking family planning services that. in fact. help to prevent the spread of Zika. Nowhere is the threat of Zika greater than in Puerto Rico. That island has been particularly hardhit. In fact. the spreading financial crisis is combining with the spreading epidemic of Zika to create a true humanitarian crisis. That crisis will only be aggravated and deepened by a failure to deal effectively with the financial default that faces the island in just a few days from now. On July 1. $2 billion of loans will come due. and Puerto Rico simply lacks the resources to pay those debts. It is insolvent. so far as those debts are concerned. If the Bankruptcy Code applied. it could seek relief from its creditors and prevent the race to the courthouse and the enormous litigation costs and other expenses that will ensue. We have an opportunity to act on behalf of the people of the United States who have a powerfully important stake in the people of Puerto Rico and the welfare of that island. It is Americans who live there3.5 million American citizens. who have fought in our wars. given of their culture and heritage to all of us. and have helped make America the greatest. strongest country in the history of the world. They are American citizens who are part of the fabric of this Nation. and the people of Puerto Rico will be the ones who pay the price of a failure on our part to act effectively. The simple fact is that Puerto Rico cannot afford to pay all of its creditors and continue to provide a basic level of services for its people. That fact is undisputed. The question is simply whether this situation is addressed in an orderly and productive way or permitted to enter the sea of chaosfinancially and in humanitarian termsthat will ensue without action on our part. Already we have seen the beginnings of this crisis. The islands only 24/7 stroke center has closed because too many Puerto Rican neurologists have left for the mainland. The Puerto Rican Department of Education has not paid hundreds of firms that provide education and transportation services. Hospitals are barely keeping the lights on. Schools cannot pay bus drivers. My colleague from Florida. Senator NELSON. told the story yesterday of the neonatal dialysis center that is providing services only to customers who can pay cash up front. Imagine. in the United StatesPuerto Rico is part of the United Stateschildren in need of lifesaving services are being turned away and denied basic health care. There is no need to guess as to what will happen on July 1. Creditors have told usin fact. they have told us very explicitly in court papers already filed last week. They wrote: ""It has long been settled law that Constitutional Debt is constitutionally required to be paid first in times of scarcity. ahead of even what government deems essential services."" They will claim to be paid in advance and in priority over essential services. That is the stark. harsh truth of litigation. and a judgment in their favor will have lasting and irreparable effects on the people of Puerto Rico. If the creditors win. the people of Puerto Rico lose. and they lose tremendously and irreparably. The Senate has a choice. Instead of allowing a chaotic process that costs tremendously in scarce resources and benefits financially the lawyers and some of the creditors more than anyone. we can pass legislation before us today. It is not the legislation I would have preferred. In fact. this deal is not one that I find attractive. There are defects and weaknesses in its provisions relating to minimum wage and overtime and pensions and the structure of the board. among others. But the question is. What is the alternative? With PROMESA. the parties will have a workable judicial mechanism with a stay on litigation. ensuring that chaos is avoided and the current mess is resolved. If we devise a system that only the creditors like and works only for them. it will benefit a small group of wealthy investors that could threaten to block Puerto Ricos economic recovery. In fact. the longest lasting and most alarming effect will be the uncertainty that results from our failure to act. which almost clearly and unavoidably will cause a deep recession in that island. It will. in effect. impede investment in the island and quash economic recovery. Representative NYDIA VELAZQUEZ put it best. She has never stopped fighting for her homeland of Puerto Rico. Before PROMESA passed the House she said: Some would have you believe that if we only yell louder. there will be a third option. But let me tell you. I have screamed so loud that I no longer have a voice. Like the vast majority of her House colleagues. she voted for PROMESA because it is the best option available now that both sides can support. No amount of wishing or yelling will change that fact. PROMESA has the support of experts across the political spectrum and editorial boards across the country. It has won support from Puerto Ricos Governor and its sole representative in the U.S. House. It has won support from business leaders in Puerto Rico and in the United States. And. crucially. the Treasury Department says it is an essential stepa first stepto avoid humanitarian catastrophe. We can come back next month. next year. or sooner to try to make it better. But there is no better bill available this week. before July 1. and the impending humanitarian crisis will most affect and most enduringly hurt the people of Puerto Rico. The choice is hope or disaster for the Americans who live in Puerto Rico. PROMESA could be better. but at the end of the day. we cannot permit the perfect to be the enemy of the good. I will continue to work for a better bill. seeking to offer amendments that improve it. and fighting afterward for still more improvements in this measure. Today I urge my colleagues to join in supporting PROMESA. Mr. President. I yield the floor."

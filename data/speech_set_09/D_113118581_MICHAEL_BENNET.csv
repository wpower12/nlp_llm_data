1130033272,Mr. President. I wish to thank the Senator from Minnesota for her remarks and say how much I appreciate her work on this legislation. on the Judiciary Committee and beyond. The chairman is here today. I wish to thank him for his leadership both on the committee and on the floor. One way or another. something important is going to happen here this weekwhich should happen more regularly than it does. but it does not. in the 4 years I have been here. that is. a bill that actually is the result of thoughtful bipartisanin some cases I even describe it as nonpartisanwork that has been done first by the socalled Gang of 8 that I was pleased to be part of. then in the Judiciary Committee itself. and now on the floor of the Senate. Before I talk about immigration. I want to mention we are still struggling out in Colorado this summer with these terrible wildfires. We have appreciated the Federal cooperation we have received. It is a reminder to me. when I stand on this floor. how important it is for us to get past this partisan gridlock we have and into a position where we are actually making shared decisions that will allow us. among other things. to do the investments we need to do to make sure our forests have the fire mitigation that will prevent them from catching and burning the way they are this summer in Colorado. Today we have the opportunity to try to work together on immigration. Opponents have come out and said this bill is going to cost us money. this bill is going to make the deficit worse. It is exactly the opposite. The Congressional Budget Office has said if we pass this bill. we will see nearly $1 trillion of deficit reduction over 20 years. This Congressional Budget Office tells us it will increase our gross domestic product by 5.4 percent over that same period of time. So this bill is a deficit reduction bill. People around here who talk about deficit reductionand I am one of themfinally have a chance to do it in a thoughtful and measured way. in a useful and constructive way. rather than through a series of mindless acrosstheboard cuts which we have seen as a consequence of the sequester. Even in Washington. DC. $1 trillion is real money. That is one reason we ought to pass this bill. Another reason we ought to pass this bill is it creates a visa system that is actually aligned to the economic needs of the United States of America. Forty percent of Fortune 500 companies have been founded by immigrants. Nearly 1 in 10 business owners in Colorado are immigrants and generate $1.2 billion for our States economy. Agriculture is a $40 billion industry in Colorado. and tourism is Colorados second largest industry. We have a growing hightech sector in Colorado. and 23.6 percent of STEM graduates from our State research universities are immigrants. We want them to earn those degrees if they are doing it in the United States and then stay here in the United States. build businesses in this country. invest in our future with us in this country. Today. because we have a broken immigration system. we are saying to those graduates. Go back to China and compete with us. go back to India and compete with us. we have no use for your talents here in this country. This bill fixes that. This bill has very important border security measures and measures to prevent future illegal immigration. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. who is on the floor. for his remarkable work with Senator HOEVEN to get us to this point. The agreement on border security. which maintains a real and attainable pathway to citizenship which was a bottom line for the Gang of 8 Senators who were working on this bill. was the result of several Senators who were willing and determined to find a way to get this done. So I thank Senator CORKER. I thank Senator HOEVEN. and I thank Senator MCCAIN and the other Republican Members of the Gang of 8 for getting us here. This is how the Senate should worka process that leads to principled compromise. On the border security amendment. some opponents of fixing our broken immigration system continue to say our bill doesnt do enough to secure the border. No reasonable person could look at this legislation and arrive at that conclusion: nearly $50 billion in additional spending at the border. 700 miles of fencing at the border. we double the number of border agents on the southern border of the United States. we go from roughly 22.000 to 44.000 border agents. Those numbers are directionally right. We double them. More money and Federal resources are devoted to securing our border than on all other law enforcement that the Federal Government undertakes. and now we are doubling it. You might be critical and say. Well. you shouldnt spend that money. although. as I mentioned earlier. this bill results in deficit reduction of almost $1 trillion over 20 years. I could see how somebody might stand up and be critical about that. I cant see how somebody could seriously maintain this bill does not secure our border. We call for an array of new technologies and resources at our border sectors to ensure 100percent surveillance and rapid interdiction of threats and potential illegal crossings. EVerify is required to be used by every employer in the United States. so we dont end up the way we did the last timewith a broken system. where small businesses either became the INS or were given fake documents and people came here where there were jobsillegally. not legally. This internal enforcement mechanism will allow us to make sure small businesses know who they are hiring. and we are turning away people who are here unlawfully and shouldnt work here in the United States of America. This is the greatest country in the world. But 40 percent of the people who are here who are undocumented came lawfully to the United States. overstayed their visas. and it is the consequence of our having a system to check people on the way in but never checks them on the way out or whether they left at all. This bill fixes that problem with a complete entryexit system. with improved biographic and biometric tracking of those who come into and leave our borders. It is about time for us to begin to apply 21st century technology to this broken immigration system we have. There are many economic reasons why we should support this bipartisan legislation. We know it will help businesses. we know it will boost our economy. we know we are securing our borders. If people dont believe me on this. I hope they will listen to Senator JOHN MCCAIN and Senator JEFF FLAKE. who are the two Republican border SenatorsSenators from a border Statewho took me and others down there to see what the border actually looked like. who support this legislation. who have to go home to Arizona and be able to defend this legislation by saying it secures the borders of the United States of America. They know what they are talking about. We also cant lose sight of what this bill means for families who are suffering under the current system. Here is one story from a bright young woman in Boulder. CO. who I had the fortunate pleasure to meet. Ana Karina Casas Ibarra. I first met Ana at a bagel shop in Boulder where my staff and I stopped in for a bite to eat. She waited on us and recognized me. When my staff overheard her explaining the dynamics of the 112th Congress. they suggested she apply for an internship in my office. She was an awesome intern. We had the opportunity to learn more about her story. Fourteen years ago. her mother brought her and her two younger brothers to the United States to escape an abusive marriage. Her mom had consistently juggled two or three jobs to support them. Although Ana was a good student. an old Colorado law denied her inState tuition. She had to work to pay for community college a few semesters at a time. Her brothers. who saw her opportunity denied. lost their motivation. One brother who speaks better English than Spanish was deported. and the other brother who has an American citizen wife and a baby is facing possible deportation right now. She just published her story in the Denver Post. She wrote: Too many families share similar horror stories of separation. There are 11 million people who have entered this country illegally. and the time is now to provide them with a path to citizenship. It is time for immigration reform. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a copy of the Denver Post oped.
1130033341,Mr. President. I wanted to come to the floor tonight to talk briefly about where we are in immigration reform. We are moving along this week. We have come out of several weeks of committee work. where there were a number of Republican amendments that were adopted as part of the process and a number of Democratic amendments adopted as part of the process. As somebody who was involved in the negotiating group that led to the bill reaching the Judiciary Committee. I actually think it was improved by both Republicans and Democrats. It has been an unusual bipartisan effort. and it is the kind of effort the American people. certainly the people of Colorado. think is long overdue. They do not understand why we seem to be engaged in these fights that dont have anything to do with them instead of working to get together constructively to meet the challenges this country faces. I think when it comes to this very difficult issue of immigrationand it is difficult. and there are strong feelings about itit has been remarkable for that reason. that we have been able to see what I would describe not even as a bipartisan process but a nonpartisan process. with people actually coming together to resolve this issue. As a result. the objections to it. the substantive objections to it are falling away. There was an objection that somehow the bill was being rushed through. Well. no. it went through the regular order. which is very rare for this place. It shouldnt be rare. but it is rare. It got a full hearing in the Judiciary Committee. and there has been a full hearing on the Senate floor. There was an argument somehow it was going to create horrible deficits. and it turns out the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said. actually. in the first 10 years it is going to improve our deficit situation by $190 billion and over the next 10 years by another $700 billionalmost $1 trillion over the course of the next 20 years. So. then. there was another argument. which was there is no border security as part of this legislation. In the Group of 8 we listened hard to what the border Senators JOHN MCCAIN and JEFF FLAKE. two Republicans from Arizona. had to say about what they believed they needed at the border. We went and visited the border with JOHN MCCAIN and JEFF FLAKE to see what they believed they needed on the Arizona border. But there were other Senators who werent satisfied by what we put in that bill. and so there was an effort that was then led by Senator CORKER from Tennessee and Senator HOEVEN to amend the bill. and we supported it. I supported that amendment. In fact. that amendment got 68 votes the other nightor something like that. We were missing a couple of Senators. We would have had 68 or 69 if everybody had been here. That is progress because that has built support for the billRepublicans and Democrats coming together around the border security issue. I think it is very hard for anybody to make a real argument this is not a significant attempt to strengthen the border in this country. We were already spending more money on border enforcement than we do on any other Federal law enforcement combined as it was. We had gone to about 22.000 Border Patrol agents already as it was. Now we are doubling that numberdoublingas an attempt to respond to a very reasonable concern the American people have that the border should be as secure as possible. So that is now part of this legislation. So those are three things people have argued: The process was too fast. the bill was going to negatively affect the deficit. and our border is still insecure. Those were the arguments that were made. Now we dont hear those arguments so much anymore. Now we hear scare stories about health care. We are hearing scare stories about how this will affect our economy even though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said we are going to see five additional points of gross domestic product growthGDP growthin the second 10 years of this bill passing. as a result of bringing people out of the shadows. It is not as if the 11 million people who are here and who are undocumented are not working. They are working. Many of them are working in this country. Many of them are working in the agriculture sector in my State and in this country. Many are working in other industries as well all across the United States. But they are working in an unlawful way. They are working in a cash economy. They are working in a situation where they are easily exploited. Because of that. they drag down the wages of everybody in America. Workers in my State who are here and who are legallegalare having to compete in a marketplace where there are people who can pay less because they know there are people who have to take less because they do not have lawful recourse. All the protections we put in this bill. all the protections to make sure. and rightfully so. an American is offered a job first. to ensure. and rightfully so. we are not bringing in a whole bunch of new people when there are Americans looking for workall of those protections pale in comparison to the protection of bringing 11 million people out of the shadows and out of a cash economy and into a place where they are paid a lawful wage and they are paying their taxes to the U.S. Government. If all someone cared about. if the only thing someone cared about when they got up in the morning and went to bed at night was rising wages for Americans. solving this issue finally for the 11 million would be the most important thing you could do. And we do that in this bill. The opponents of this bill are not seriously suggesting they are going to go to the expense of sending 11 million people back to where they came from. They are not seriously suggesting. in answer to this issue. that nothing in the CBO report is true. that none of it makes sense. that this is about ObamaCare when what we are really trying to do for once in this place is solve a set of challenging issues in a bipartisan way. Mr. President. even more than that. for a decade or more. because of our broken immigration system. the policy of this country has been to turn back talented peopleeven people educated at our universities. even people educated to be engineers and mathematicians. When they have graduated from college here. at our expense. in many cases. we have not said to them: Stay here and build your business. Compete here and help us grow this economy. Start a businessas half of the Fortune 100 or 500 companies have been started by immigrants. No. We have said: Go home. Go home to India and compete with us from there. Go home to China and hire other people over there. If we pass this bill. we will say once again that this nation of immigrants is open for business. that we are open to the most creative and talented people in the world. that we want them to drive our economy in the United States just as they have generation after generation going back to our Founders. It is a great testament to who we are and to the nature of our country that people want to come here. and under the right circumstances we should have them here. The CBO reportand I dont even care about the CBO reportmakes it very clearmakes it very clearwhat businesspeople in my State already know: It makes it clear to the agricultural industry in my State. the hightech industry in my State. the ski resorts in my State that the objections of people of goodwill on this bill have been met through compromise and through principled agreement. This is a good piece of legislation. We shouldnt. in this ninth or eleventh hour or whatever it isthe ninth inningallow ourselves to get distracted by the politics seeking to divide us in this Chamber or in this country. And I dont believe we will. So I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill. With that. I yield the floor.
1130033731,"Mr. President. there is no one else on the floor. I thought I would take the opportunity to talk again a little bit about our immigration bill. This has been such a gratifying process to me because it has been bipartisan from the start. In fact. I have been telling people that it is not even that it has been bipartisan. it has been nonpartisan. The work on the Gang of 8. which led to work in the Judiciary Committee. which led to work on the floor is the way this place ought to operate on a whole host of issues. from energythe Presiding Officer cares a lot about thatto infrastructure. to the budget issues I was just talking about with the Senator from Texas. It is important for people to know that this is a bipartisan bill because I think people are fed up with the partisanship in this town. and they do not believe it reflects the way they live their lives. There is a reason for that. It does not. This place is decoupled from the lives of ordinary American people. and this is an effortamong others. hopefullyto recouple those priorities. I have been interested in the objections to the immigration bill since the beginning. First there was the objection that it was actually going to drive up our deficit. Not surprisingly. we learned from the Congressional Budget Office that this bill actually would create the most significant deficit reduction of any piece of legislation we considered here. certainly that we passed here-$197 billion in the first 10 years. $700 billion in the second 10 years. Even in Washington. $1 trillion is still a lot of money. That is what we heard. both because people now not paying taxes would be paying taxes and also because of the economic growth that would be generated if we could restore the rule of law to our immigration system and to this economy. That was an objection. That objection was answerednot by me but by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The second objection was that the legislation was not going to get a fair airing. that it was going to be rushed through in the dead of night. I dont like doing work that way. There were eight ""no"" votes on the fiscal cliff deal at the end of the year. and I was one of those ""no"" votes. one of three Democrats who voted no not largely but partly because it had not had any process and it was in the middle of the night. This bill. by contrast. had 7 months of negotiations among four Democrats and four Republicans. It had 3 weeks to go through the Judiciary Committee. a markup that had 160some amendments. many of which were accepted. Fortyone Republican amendments were accepted to this bill. It came to the floor for the debate we have had over the last few weeks. I realize the amendment process is jammed up. and I am sorry about that because I think people ought to be ableincluding the Presiding Officerto offer the wise amendments they have and the notsowise amendments they have. at least in my opinion. But there certainly has been an open process for this bill. Sometimes I have heard people say. well. it is just like health care all over again. I was here during the health care bill. and I can say this process looks nothing like that process. There is a third objection from some who say there is no border security in this bill. First of all. that wasnt even true of the Gang of 8 bill. We had substantial border security. and as my lead. I was taking what JOHN MCCAIN and JEFF FLAKEboth Senators from Arizonasaid was important. They are two Senators who have a border State. and they have been working hard to resolve these issues in our group. We made a substantial investment in that bill for border security and technology. Even fencing was included in that bill. I think it is a reasonable expectationnot of Republicans but of the American peoplethat our border should be secure. Certainly the people in Colorado believe our border should be secure. So when Senators came and said: We would like to vote for this bill. but we would like to do more on border security. not only was I open to that. I supported that. The bill before us has incredibly substantial border security. There are 700 more miles of fencing. We doubled the number of Border Patrol agents on the border. One of the Senators said to me that we are at a point now where there is a Border Patrol agent every 1.000 feet on the southern border. One might ask whether that is a wise use of resources. but it was important for some people to have that before they would sign on to this bill. So I dont think any reasonable person looking at this could say border security has not been addressed. So what are the objections to moving forward? We have heard people say: Well. it is the path to citizenship or we dont like that part of the bill. That was a core principle for the four Democrats and four Republicans who started this negotiation. and it has been a core principle for a lot of people who voted for this bill. A very important reason to pass this legislation is to resolve the situation for the 11 million people who are here illegally. The pathway to citizenship is the right way to do it. This is not amnesty. This has to be earned. People have to pay a fine. People have to learn English for the first time in our history. People have to pay their taxes. It takes 10 years to get a green card. then 3 years after that. They have to pass background checks all along the way so we know who the people are we want to stay in this country and who the people are we want to leave this country. I see the Senator from Louisiana is here. so I will wrap up. To my friends who think some lawful status that doesnt include a pathway to citizenship is useful to this country. I ask them to look at countries all around the world that have created a subclass of peoplenot even citizens. just a subclass of peoplewho have no attachment to their culture. no feeling they are ever going to participate in their civic or political institutions or meaningfully in their economy. no chance to believe their children or the children after them are actually going to make those contributions as well. and ask: Does that look like the United States of America to you? That is not what the Founders had in mind. We hear a lot of cheap talk about the Founders around here these days. That is not what the Founders had in mind when they wrote into the Constitution that it was our responsibility as a body to deal with immigration. So I hope people will consider that objection. take a look at the Senate bill. and will. hopefully. support it. With that. I know the Senator from Louisiana was scheduled to speak. so I will yield the floor."
1130033744,Mr. President. I am here today on the immigration bill. but I wish to thank the Senator from Vermont for bringing our attention to this very serious issue. It is a little bit of a variation on a theme today about trying to reconnect the priorities of the American peoplefrankly. whether they are Republicans or Democrats or anybody elseand this place. which has become totally disconnected. I wish to say through the Chair to the Senator from Vermont how on point he is. The people I represent care about the fact that they are living in an economy that even when it growsI was talking about this a little bit earlierit is not producing sufficient jobs and it is not driving up income. That is what they are concerned about. The student debt crisis the Senator speaks about. where it tripled over the last 10 years. is a huge part of this story. It is a significant part. because if a familys income is going down but the cost of higher education is skyrocketingby the way. at the same time the cost of health care is skyrocketingit makes it very hard to get ahead. People are desperately worried. as I said earlier. that we are going to be the first generation of Americans to leave less opportunity. not more. to our kids and grandkids. But there is another issue as well. which is today. in the 21st century in this country. if a person is born and living in poverty. their chances of getting a college degree or the equivalent of a college degree are 9 in 1009 in 100. For the folks in the Chamber. for the pages who are here today. we have 100 chairs. 100 desks in the Senate. If these desks represented poor children living in this country instead of Senators. those four desks in the front row and four at that end right there. and another one. those are the only folks who would be getting a college degree. Ninetyone other people in this Chamber would be constrained to the margin of this economy and a margin of our democracy from the outset. Matters are getting worse. not better. We led the world in the production of college graduates when George Bushthis is not a partisan observation. it is a temporal onewhen George Bush. the son. became President. We led the world. Let me tell the young people who are here today. 13 years later. we are 16th in the world in the production of college graduates. Because of our inability to come together and figure out how to deal comprehensively over time in a thoughtful way with the fact that we dont want to stick our kids with this debt we have acquiredwhich we need to do. we are just hacking away at domestic discretionary spending for higher education. for K 12 education. for agriculture. for infrastructure. Some of these budgets we have consideredwe have not passed them here. they passed them over in the Housewould invest only 4 percent of our revenue. 4 percent of the revenue we collect. in the future of this country. Ninetysix percent on something else is not going to get the job done. On an issue such as this. where our students are saying: How do you at least not make matters worse. we ought to be able to come together in a bipartisan way and solve this problem. I thank the Senator from Vermont for coming to the floor to focus our attention on something the American people actually care about.
1130034540,"Mr. President. I wish to start by thanking the able Senator from Arizona for his statement. for his leadership. and for his incredible work on this bill. I wish to thank all of my colleagues who have been in this socalled Gang of 8. both Democrats and Republicans. including CHUCK SCHUMER and DICK DURBIN and BoB MENENDEZ on the Democratic side. But today I especially want to thank the Republican Members of this group. led by JOHN MCCAIN. and including LINDSEY GRAHAM. JEFF FLAKE. and MARCO RUBIO. for their extraordinary leadership. For reasons everybody in this Chamber understands. their willingness to be at the table and to stay at the table was an act of leadership unlike any other I have seen in this Chamber in the 4 years I have served here. We would never be here today voting to fix our broken immigration system were it not for them. So on behalf of the people I represent in Colorado I thank them. For me this all started in Colorado. because everywhere I went I heard people talk about how the broken immigration system was affecting them. I would hear the peach growers in Palisades say one thing and the cattle ranchers on the eastern plains say something else. The immigrant rights community. many of whom represented children in my old school district. our hightech community. our ski resortseverybody was feeling the pain of a broken immigration system that Washington was refusing to fix and they had actually given up hope that Washington would fix it. They didnt know each other cared about this issue. so we pulled them together over about a 2year period. We had hundreds of meetings and traveled thousands of miles in the State to create something called the Colorado Compact. a statement of six principles about what Colorado expected immigration reform to look like. Now that we have come to the end of this processwe have come to the end of the Gang of 8. finishing the Judiciary Committee proceedings. the work on the floorI can say this bill is entirely consistentit is not identical. but it is entirely consistent with those principles. The first of those principles of the Colorado Compact is immigration is a Federal responsibility. This is not something that should be done State by State by State in this country. The Founders themselves recognized this because they put the regulation of immigration in the Constitution and charged the U.S. Congress as our obligation to deal with it. That was the first principle. The second principle was ensuring our national security. This bill meets that test as well. It is the strongest border security bill ever passed in the Senate. It doubles the number of Border Patrol agents on the southern border. We build 700 miles of fencing. It adds new technologies. We spend nearly $50 billion on border security. I believe we should have a secure border. In Washington this becomes a trade. For me. it is not a trade. We should have a secure border. and we should have a pathway to citizenship. and this bill accomplishes both. The people in Colorado who wrote this Colorado Compact called for more effective enforcement of our immigration law. and this bill will give them that. It includes a fully operational. biographic. and biometric entryexit system. more effective measures to detect fraud and abuse of our visa system. and an employment verification system to be used by all employers. This is all in this bill. That has not been in prior efforts that either passed or failed in the Congress. but it is in this bill. and it is a critical part to making sure we dont end up here again. The Colorado Compact said we should have a bill that strengthens our economy. This bill meets that test with a visa system much better aligned for our 21st century economya meritbased system. We have hightech and INVEST visas. visas for agriculture that will give our farmers and ranchers a fighting chance to hold on to their farms and to their ranches. and give the people who are working in that industry muchneeded relief. There are great benefits for our tourism and ski industry as well. And. on top of everything else. the Congressional Budget Office tells us this bill doesnt increase our deficit but reduces it over the first 10 years by $197 billion and over the next 10 years by $700 billion. Colorado said we want a bill that is focused on families and keeping families together. This bill does that by clearing the green card backlog and ensuring family members are able to reunite more quickly. There is better protection for children in detention and the immigration court system. Finally. we call for a commonsense approach to the 11 million. and this bill does that with a tough but fair path to citizenship for the 11 million. As so many people in this Chamber. my life story is a story of immigration because I am the son of an immigrant. My mom was born in Poland in 1938 while Nazi tanks massed at the border. She and her parents miraculously survived one of the worst human events in our history: The Holocaust. After going to Sweden and Mexico City. they were able to come to New York City in 1950. My mom was almost 12 years old. She is the only one in the family who can speak any English at all. On my first birthdaythis is 1965. so 15 years after they came to the countrymy grandparents sent me a birthday card. This is the card they wrote. Here is what they said. in English. by the way. They said this in English: The ancient Greeks gave the world the high ideals of democracy. in search of which your dear mother and we came to the hospitable shores of beautiful America in 1950. We have been happy here ever since. beyond our greatest dreams and expectations. with democracy. freedom. and love. and humanitys greatest treasure. We hope that when you grow up. you will help to develop in other parts of the world a greater understanding of these American values. They had only been in this country for 15 years. They didnt speak English when they got here. They had survived the most horrific event of the 20th century. and this was the place that gave them hope and. more than that. it allowed them to rebuild their lives in the only country in the world where they thought they could. This bill reaffirms we are a Nation that respects the rule of law and reaffirms our history that we are a Nation of immigrants. and it will keep that hope alive for millions of people. both here and abroad. for years to come. I urge a ""yes"" vote on this bill. With that. I yield the floor."
1130044882,Mr. President. today I wish to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the Cadet Chapel at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In the half century since its founding. the Cadet Chapel has become a National Historic Landmark and the most popular manmade attraction in Colorado. Each year more than 750.000 visitors explore this iconic and unique building. Today. the Cadet Chapel is a multifaith house of worship specifically designed to provide multiple distinct worship areas under a single roof. meeting the spiritual needs of the Academys cadets. The chapels aluminum. glass and steel structure features 17 spires that soar 150 feet toward the Colorado sky. Annually. over 4.000 cadets are provided 850 religious worship and educational opportunities to practice their personal faith. The chapel also provides religious rites and observances such as baptisms and dedications. weddings. funerals and memorial services. Most worship services are open to the general public and thousands of visitors each year attend worship. The Cadet Chapel fosters outstanding civic involvement by partnering with the local community to host four annual free concerts with over 2000 attendees. The U.S. Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel is truly unique. Its iconic architectural structure serves as a symbol of the Academy and is recognized worldwide. Most important. the Cadet Chapel enables the free exercise of religion for cadets in this unique campus setting and aids the Chaplain Corps at the Air Force Academy to inspire men and women to become leaders of character through spiritual formation. In the 50 years since the Cadet Chapel was dedicated our Nation has sent Air Force Academy graduates to serve in the skies and jungles of Vietnam and the deserts of Iraq. Those that once bowed their head beneath the spires of the Chapel served our country in the former Yugoslavia and in the mountains of Afghanistan. and they continue to serve the cause of freedom around the globe today. We thank them for their service. and we congratulate the Air Force on the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the Air Force Academys Cadet Chapel.*
1130054174,"Madam President. most of us here in the Senate have read at least something about our Nations founding. Although it is striking. what is almost always overlooked is the Founders use of the language of ""the republic."" Asked by a citizen on the street which was being created behind closed doors in Philadelphia. ""a Republic or a monarchy."" Benjamin Franklin famously said: ""A republic. if you can keep it."" As with most foundational decisions. the Founders made this choice deliberately. The idea of democracy frightened Hamilton. Adams. and others. because they equated it with mobs in the street. They worried that mob rule would overcome rights bestowed not by their government but by their Creator. They studied the classics and their models were the Greek and Roman republics. They set out to do something never done before. to create a republic of the scope and scale never before attempted. and one that could expand as the country grew. Today we are the worlds oldest and greatest democracy. During the last century. America has expanded the constitutional rights of women and people of color well beyond landowning White men. originally privileged. In our time. we have come to understand that democracies are about the rights of citizens. but a republic. the Founders understood. is about the duties of citizens. the obligations a citizen has to a society whose constitution guarantees his or her rights. Basic duties are to pay taxes levied by a representative government. to defend our country when called upon. and to obey the law. Our Founders had something even greater in mind. qualities that would make a republic endure. Like republics from ancient Athens forward. they believed in popular sovereignty. based on citizen participation in government. They believed in the commonwealth. all those things we hold and value in common. such as our defense and our shared infrastructure. and the welfare of the next generation of Americans. They believed in putting the common interest above personal or narrow interests. a sense of the national interest. How else could committed slaveowners and abolitionists form a country and a government? They believed in resistance to corruption. those who would turn the national interest to personal gain. We were founded as a republic and we have become more democratic across time. We are democratic and republican. Interestingly enough. what came to be the semblance of the first political party in America called itself the Democratic Republicans. It was founded in 1791. Sounds pretty weird today. I know. but it simply meant those who believed in democratic equality and freedom. working to uphold the ideals of the Republic. One of our bedrock American principles is that we must protect our rights through performance of our duties. That is not some abstract political theory. This is a definition of who we are and how we must govern ourselves. We have rights and responsibilities as citizens and as Senators. We have the right to free speech but the responsibility not to shout ""fire"" in a crowded theater. We have the right to assemble but the responsibility to do so peacefully. In this body we have the right to filibuster but the responsibility to govern on behalf of the American people. But the fewer the Americans who exercise the most fundamental right. I would say duty. of voting. the more political influence extreme groups in our society have. This is where we find ourselves at the dawn of the 21st century. with a Senate that at times is dominated by a small faction that does not represent the mainstream of American political thought. and a House that is gerrymandered into dysfunction. This institutional paralysis has created a vacuum into which a million special interests happily roam. Actually. I should call them narrow. not special. interests. From ancient Athens onward. narrow interests have been the enemy of every republic. That has never been truer than it is today. Keeping the Republic created by our Founders should concern every generation of Americans. including our own. The sovereign power belongs to all the people. not just a vocal few. It is our responsibility. it is our duty. as elected officials when that ideal is tested. to work together to restore a sense of the commonwealth and the common good that enabled us to prevail in world wars and to overcome depressions. This is our cause. but we are stuck. We are stuck because we are fighting over yesterdays battles instead of seeking to anticipate. as our Founders did. how we will manage change. To one degree or another. all Senators and possibly all Americans are conservative. If conservative means to protect our Nations principles and ideals. I am a conservative. If conservative means to preserve a culture of tolerance. justice. and equality. I am a conservative. If conservative means to respect the unique cultural heritage of America. I am a conservative. If conservative means to protect our natural heritage. I am very much a conservative. But while we protect and preserve the best of what makes us who we are. we must adapt to change. Scarcely one of us in the Senate has ever sought office without advocating some kind of change: change of officeholder. change of party. change of policy. That is good. because the future is arriving faster and faster and we have gotten no better at anticipating it. Even with the seemingly endless crawls of the words ""breaking news"" at the bottom of our screens. no one predicted the Arab spring before it sprung. That is the most closely watched region in the world. There are great historic tides that demand that we change and adapt to them in order to preserve and protect and conserve our central values. We do not live in a stagnant world. Indeed. we are living in the midst of great revolution that makes the 21st century as different from the 20th as the 18th century was from the 17th. We are living through what may be the peak years of change on the scale of the Industrial Revolution. But even though we may come here oriented to change. the institutions of government. Congress included. are oriented to the past. Our committee structure and our regulatory agencies imagine an economy that existed deep in the last century. We are designed to support incumbent interests. not the innovators that will drive job growth and wage growth in the 21st century. This is a fatal flaw. if we are ever going to tackle the growing income inequality that our Nation faces. an inequality that has been unmatched since 1928. We are regulating the telegraph when the world is wireless. Just one example: Almost a year ago I visited Apple out in Silicon Valley to learn something about their work in education. A little over 4 years ago. when I was superintendent of Denver Public Schools. I did not spend one second thinking about how to apply a tablet to the education of our kids. because there was no such thing as a tableta little over 4 years ago. Today the tablet. combined with platforms such as the iTunes platform. presents an unbelievable opportunity for our children and children all over the world to learn and to teach each other. It was amazing to see. In any case. Apple presented a slide showing that 75 percent of their last 12 months of revenue was derived from products they did not sell 5 years before75 percent of their revenue came from things they did not sell 5 years before. We have not updated our Tax Code since 1986. I was in college in 1986. What are the chances that our Tax Code is helping drive job and wage growth in 2013. 27 years later. more than a quarter of a century later? In this Congress and in this government. we are desperately out of sync with the world as it is. It is. in fact. an irony that we must change and adapt to preserve the principles that we treasure. But we must. Today. many flying the tea party banner resist all change. Indeed. they want to go back. often to a past that never existed. or to a time that has no relation to our time. Too often. their politics embrace old interests that will not drive us forward to an economy that is creating jobs and raising wages. Our founding principles should not change. I agree with that. But our practices and methods must change to become relevant. These two parties. or three with the tea party. have to escape their orthodoxies for this to be possible. Efforts to maintain the status quo or to return to some mythical past are doomed to fail. That is simply because time and the tides of human affairs will not stand still. We do not control history and cannot dictate to it. Change is the one constant. How we attempt to shape it to our purposes. by creative. imaginative public policies will determine whether we can preserve the best of our past. our principles. our heritage. and our values. Those who seek to protect our Nation against change by sitting on the beach before a massive incoming tide with shovel in hand will be swept away as surely as King Canute. As I mentioned earlier. anyone who believes their orthodoxy or their ideological orientation prepared them for the Arab spring or made us safer is deluded. Our job must be to create a shared understanding of the facts when we work in a town that is arranged to obscure them. Despite the desires of nostalgia. we are not going back to the laissez faire world of Herbert Hoover. Social safety nets are here to stay to protect children. the elderly. the poor. the disabled. and to protect our ability to call ourselves a civilized nation. But even they will have to be changed if they are going to survive for the next generation of Americans. The revolution of globalization and information has transformed the worlds economy and cultures and societies all across the globe. including here in the United States. These revolutions. like the Industrial Revolution before them. cannot be stopped. It is up to us to decide whether we can accept this new reality and position our country to lead. as it has since our founding. or whether we shrink into an imaginary conception of what the world once was and what the United States once was. With all of this change and pace of globalization comes fear of the future and a sense of loss of what once was. That is human nature. I do not exempt myself from that. At a time of uncertainty. it has become fashionable in some political circles to capitalize on it politically. This kind of demagoguery is not unknown in American history. Anytime Americans become fearful or worried. there have always been those who saw personal advantage in fanning those flames. But they do not join an honor roll of history. an assembly of our greatest leaders. Media attention. which is easy and cheap. is not a measure of leadership. Division does not require moral authority. If we are at another of historys turning points. as many believe. as I believe. one road leads to the worst of our past. The other leads to a new definition of our freedoms. We treasure the freedoms incorporated in the First Amendment to our Constitution. We remember at the height of the Great Depression that Franklin Roosevelt declared four new freedoms: Freedom of speech and worship and freedom from want and fear. Today. in the middle of what one might characterize as a political depression. lets consider some new freedoms for the 21st century: Freedom from foreign oil. freedom from false patriotism. freedom from the politics of division. freedom to create a constructive future. and. yes. freedom from unconstitutional government surveillance. We have duties to perform far greater than merely funding the government. Just ask any poor child or her teacher in a typical American school. The good news is that fear has never and will not now dictate the fate of our Republic. Historys dustbin is filled with failed demagogues. And we are not going back. But we need to hurry. The world is not waiting for us. Americans want us to move forward into the 21st century with the imagination. creativity. adaptability. and values that have made this country so great from its founding. The stakes are simply too high in our time to allow our institutions to be crippled by politicians who color far outside the lines of conventional American political thought and who react with angry and mock surprise when their policy objectives are not achieved. It is time to close this sorry chapter in the history of the Congress. reopen our government. preserve the full faith and credit of the United States. and work together as Senators from the various States on the peoples business. I suspect that is why most of us wanted to serve to begin with. Madam President. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum."
1130073424,"Mr. President. I thank my friend from Oklahoma for yielding. I wish to speak about the farm bill which. thanks to months and months and actually years of tireless work by Chairwoman STABENOW. Ranking Member COCHRAN. and other conferees on the bill. Democrats and Republicans in both Houses of Congressthanks to all of this work. we are going to be able to pass this bill this afternoon. There are 16 million people working in agriculture in our country. These workers and our rural communities are demanding the certainty which comes with a longterm bill. I am pleased to say we are passing not a 2month extension. not a 10minute extension. not an ""I hope we get it done tomorrow before we leave town"" extension but a genuine 5year farm bill. which is going to give us a lot of certainty. This bill eliminates direct payments made to farmers regardless of market conditions or what they planted and prioritizes what is working for producers. namely. crop insurance. I have spoken on the floor before about Colorados battle against historic drought conditions. Some of our farmers lost half their corn yields in 2012. It is hard to imagine any business losing half its production in 1 year. but that is what has happened to many Colorado corn producers. Mr. President. 2013 was a little better for corn in our State. but it is hard to celebrate when producers still face significant losses fighting against this dry soil. The Crop Insurance Program is what is keeping these farmers and rural economies in business during these tough times. That is why it is a priority. That is why we should have passed it 1 year ago. 2 years ago. but today we finally have the chance to do it. Beyond crop insurance. another key highlight of this bill is its conservation title. I spoke last week on the floor about the revamped easement programs. and the important linkage between conservation practices and crop insurance which has been preserved in this conference agreement. But beyond those highlights. the bill places a new emphasis on water conservation. which is so important to the West. Programs such as EQIP and the Regional Conservation Partnerships Program are going to be critical as the West faces record drought conditions brought on by climate change. New conservation tools. coupled with crop insurance to help hedge risk. will help our producers as we move into a new normal of a drier American West. The conservation title programs help producers. but they also help the fish in our rivers and the wildlife on our lands. Here is a great illustration of why sportsmen groups support this bill. This is a photo taken of my friend John Gale hunting pheasants in Yuma County. CO. The Conservation Reserve Program. CRPa program reauthorized through this farm billprovides important habitat for pheasants and other upland birds all across the country. The land surrounding this photo is all CRP land. The program protects habitat but also helps hold highly erodible soils in placesuch as the soil in Baca County. CO. where over 250.000 acres are enrolled in CRP. As the Presiding Officer may know. Baca County in many ways was the epicenter of the area devastated by the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Thanks to CRP. Baca County has weathered recent droughts a lot better than their forefathers did. Healthy grasslands. open landscapes. and abundant wildlife are a fundamental part of the West. to be a part of the West. and we need to preserve those grasslands. those open spaces. and our species. That is what the conservation title of the farm bill does. A lot of people dont know about it. but it is a very important part of the farm bill. As a result. this farm bill is supported by over 250 conservation and environmental organizationsgroups such as Ducks Unlimited. Pheasants Forever. National Wildlife Federation. Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. and the National Rifle Association. among others. This legislation not only ensures we have healthy croplands and grasslands but also prioritizes the health of our forestsan issue of huge importance to western States as we deal with our massive wildfires. Here we can see the Waldo Canyon fire from 2012. I chair the agriculture subcommittee on forestry. and we held a hearing on wildfires not too long ago. We looked at the terrible fires which have raged across the West. the budgetary nightmare they have caused. and Washingtons inability to understand what we are actually facing out there. My clearest takeaway from this hearing was that when it comes to our forests. an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If we prioritize the fuel mitigation work on the front end. we will save on fire suppression and recovery costs on the back end. If we dont. we will break our budget and not preserve our forests. The Congressional Budget Office has found that for every $1 we invest in forest health. we save $5 in costs associated with wildfire. This farm bill conference report makes these investments and gives the Forest Service new tools to treat areas in need of restoration and mitigation. This bill makes commonsense reforms. reduces the deficit. and will bring certainty and continued prosperity to rural America. It passed the House last week with broad bipartisan support. I strongly urge a ""yes"" vote when we vote on the farm bill conference report later today. With all the uncertainty our farmers and ranchers are facing in these tough times. in these drought times. it is the least we can do. I yield the floor."
1130126515,"Madam President. I wish to take a moment today to speak about my friend MARK UDALL. who is soon going to be finishing his term. MARKs sister Doty describes him as an OK politician but an extraordinary public servant. I think it is fair to say that MARK could never reduce his role as a representative of the people of Colorado to just politics. It is not in his DNA. It is with a very heavy heart that I see him leave the Senate. because he is my friend. But it is especially sad at a time when MARKs kind of leadership and constructive engagement is exactly what this place needs. ""UDALL"" is a name that is synonymous with the West. and MARK and the collective service of the Udall family have come to represent the very best of our western way of life. They have embodied that pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit dating back to the days when Americans were building entirely new lives on the frontier. They have a historic love for the beauty and majesty of the West. They have spent lifetimes protecting it. Mo and Stu Udall. MARKs uncle and father. both served our country during World War II. Stu was elected to serve the Second District of Arizona. When President Kennedy asked Stu to serve as the Secretary of Interior. Mo won Stus seat in Congress. Unlike his son MARK. Mo never ran for the Senate. He explained why. He said: I told the Arizona Press Club with [Barry] Goldwater present that there were three reasons I was not running for the Senate: 1. I love the House. 2. My wife and family are against it. And 3. I have taken a poll and you are going to beat the hell out of me. Although. he did run for President. The New Republic reported on that: The Arizona Congressman. Morris Udall liked to tell a story about a response he got at a barber shop in Maine: He looked in at the door and. meaning to introduce himself. said ""Mo Udall. running for president."" ""Yeah."" the barber said. ""we were just laughing about it this morning."" It is not hard to know where MARK acquired his selfdeprecating approach to the world. just as it not hard to know where he inherited his commitment to civil rights. to conservation. and to good government. MARK has said it was during this time that his political views were formed. He himself went on to seek office. In 2008. when MARK was elected to represent Colorado in the Senate. his cousin TOMStus sonwas elected to serve the State of New Mexico and is one of our colleagues today. MARK UDALLs connection to the West and to public service comes from both sides of his family. Mo Udall. a man of many talents. met Patricia Emory. MARKs mother. while playing baseball in Colorado. Patricia or ""Sam"" Udall was a sharpshooter. pilot. Peace Corps volunteer at the age of 56. She was a native Coloradan and the person MARK credits most for his passion for the outdoors. for backpacking and climbing. Today in the 21st century we face a profound set of challenges and a dramatic test of our democratic institution. Can what MARK UDALL often calls this glorious experiment in selfgovernment continue to thrive into the next century and beyond? MARK has carried the tradition of his family by serving as a moral forwardpointing compass. Throughout his career he has defended personal freedom and liberty. and he has built a legacy of conservation and preservation. As a member of the Colorado General Assembly representing Longmont and parts of Boulder County. MARK toughened the laws against poaching big game as trophy animals. As a Member of the House of Representatives. he worked across the aisle to establish the Rocky Flats Wildlife Refuge. cleaning up the former nuclear site and preserving 4.000 acres of wild land near Denver. He established the James Peak Wilderness Area. protecting 14.000 acres of some of our most scenic land in Gilpin and Grand Counties. He passed the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act to designate nearly 250.000 acres within the park as wilderness. including Longs Peak. which is actually a l4er that I have climbed. MARK UDALL has climbed all of them in Colorado. every single l4er we have. because they are included in the tallest 100 mountains that we have. each one of which has been summited by MARK UDALL. These are lands that will be protected long after any of our political careers are over and long after they remember who it was who protected those lands to begin with. But if anybody cares to check. they are going to know that it was MARK UDALL. MARK has been vocal. active. and effective in his fight against climate change and in his promotion of renewable energy. He was the statewide cochair of the successful 2004 campaign to pass Colorados amendment 37. This measure required Colorados power companies to generate most of their electricity from renewable sources. Colorado was the first State in the Union to take the issue to the voters. Amendment 37 passed. MARK UDALL was the driving force behind that effort. After his victory in the State. MARK took this issue to the House of Representatives. The House has twice passed the national renewable electricity standard championed by MARK. During his time in the Senate. he has continued to push for a national policy. and his doggedness in standing up for Colorados wind energy production saved thousands of goodpaying jobs across the State and ensured that we will continue to lead the Nation in developing our clean energy economy. The same is true for our ski areas. which have expanded recreation activities and summertime job opportunities thanks to a law MARK passed in this Senate. Colorados aerospace industry is thriving in part thanks to MARK UDALL. His work on space policy also dates back to his time in the House of Representatives as ranking member on the Space Subcommittee. MARK helped revitalize aeronautics and aviation research and development at NASA and ensure that the Hubble space telescope received service and funding. In the Senate. MARK helped lead the Colorado delegation opposition to a proposal that would have canceled the Orion Program. costing the State 1.000 jobs. The administration backed off. Last week. with a shuttle and rocketboth built by companies based in ColoradoNASA launched a successful test flight of the Orion vehicle. We will again carry astronauts into space. traveling deeper than ever before and eventually maybe even visit Mars. As everybody in this Chamber knows. MARK has been a staunch defender of the rights and freedoms we cherish as westerners. As a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. MARK fought every single day he was here to protect the security of the American people and the Bill of Rights. He has taken on NSA and CIA when they violated our constitutional values. In 2011 he worked on a classified level to pressure intelligence officials to dismantle a massive email collection program that affected American privacy. Administration officials were unable to provide evidence that the program was effective. It was shut down. It only became public information when the New York Times reported on it in July of Well before Edward Snowden made headlines in 2013. MARK warned of the NSAs overreach. In 2012. on this Senate floor. he warned the American people that they would be shocked to learn about what the NSA was doing in secret. He introduced landmark. bipartisan surveillance reform legislation with Senators RON WYDEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL. and RAND PAUL. It became the basis for the USA FREEDOM Act. which received 58 votes just a few weeks ago. There was a time. before the relentless use of the filibuster. when a majority of votes in the Senate would have been enough to ensure passage of that bill. Earlier this week the Intelligence Committee released the executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committees study of the CIAs detention and interrogation program. Nobody in this place fought harder than MARK UDALL to shed light on these tactics. His goal from day one has been holding the CIA accountable. shedding light on this dark chapter of our history. and ensuring that the neither the CIA nor any other agency or future administration would make the grievous mistakes that were made here. He accomplished his goals with respect to the process without leaking classified information but by applying pressure both politically and privately until the report was finally released. He has been effective because he has stood on consistent principle on every issue we have faced. He voted against the PATRIOT Act. He opposed the war in Iraq. He helped lead the fight to end dont ask. dont tell. MARK truly is the very best of what it means to be a public servant: independent. responsible. tough. focused on the future. and possessing an abiding cando spirit. His calm presence. his unassuming nature. and his ability to see pure good in those around him are exactly what we so desperately need in our process today. Simply put. MARK UDALL has fought for Colorado families in the most constructive way possibleby pushing thoughtful commonsense solutionsbut has never ever fought to achieve a partisan political fleece. When Colorado was struck with a series of natural disasters. from wildfires to floods. MARK was at his very best. standing up for our State and our families to lead the efforts to ensure that our communities had the support they needed to recover and better prepare for the threats we faced next. He has strengthened the way we respond to the growing threat of wildfire by emphasizing preservation efforts that will save lives. property. and tax dollars. We would expect nothing else from a man who has dedicated himself and his career to standing up for Colorado families. the middle class. and the values of the American West. As a Senator. a Representative. a State legislator. director of the Colorado Outward Bound school. MARK has been a model public servant. He has lived up to and exceeded the high standards his family has set for more than a century. Throughout all of his work. MARK has always fought against the dysfunction that persists in Washington. It is true. however. that MARK cannot take full credit for the work. His wife and partner Maggie Fox shares his commitment to leaving more opportunity for the next generation. She has worked as a teacher and community organizer on the Navajo and Hopi reservations of Arizona. New Mexico. and for the Colorado. North Carolina. and Northwest Outward Bound schools. She has become a leading voice in many efforts to protect our land. our air. and our water. Their partnership is a genuine one. It has made MARKS work possible. MARKS staff has been among the finest. most professional. and most effective in the Senate. It has been a pleasure for me and for my staff to work alongside them on behalf of the people of Colorado. Over the past few years I have learned that really there are two broad categories of people in Washington: There are those who embrace and add to the dysfunction because it serves their ideological convictions or gives them an opportunity to star on the cable news or both. Then there are the people who are actually trying to save the place. They are looking for areas of compromise to break the gridlock and to move us forward. MARK is one of the good ones. and I have no doubt he will continue to make profound contributions to Colorado and to our Nation in a variety of ways. but we are diminished by his loss. Every one of us. for the sake of this institution. would do well to live up to the example MARK UDALL has set. I yield the floor."

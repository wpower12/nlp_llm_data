1140012735,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for their work on this. It has been a bipartisan effort. It has been a long time since we have seen a rail bill. and its about time. We need to do something to improve our rail system. This bill authorizes $7.2 billion for passenger rail over the next 4 fiscal years and will help improve Amtraks service and longterm stability. It has a wide range of support from all the stakeholders. I have two Amtrak stations in my region. and both of them are in communities that are devastated by the economic downturn. and unfortunately. our small businesses have been slower to recover from the recession because they have less access to capital and information. Section 208 of this bill directs Amtrak to submit a report to Congress within 1 year on the options to enhance economic development around the Amtrak stations. This provision requires Amtrak to issue a request for proposals seeking persons or entities to carry out these proposals. My amendment encourages the process to be inclusive of socially and economically disadvantaged businesses while keeping the intent to strengthen multimodal connections. capturing developmentrelated streams. meaning multiple revenue sources and better leveraging station assets. We need to encourage our socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses a chance to provide their input and feedback on station development proposals in and around Amtrak communities. A disadvantaged business is one that is at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or groups. According to the Minority Business Development Agency. only 2 percent of all minorityowned firms are considered high revenue. meaning businesses with annual receipts of over $1 million. These enterprises account for 68 percent of total receipts and 61 percent of all jobs produced by all minority enterprises. As these businesses grow and innovate. so does the rest of our economy. Our society and economy is made stronger from diversity. and socially and economically disadvantaged businesses should have information to compete and to be included in all the business development with public and private entities. The Department of Transportation has done very well in recognizing the role that disadvantaged small businesses play in the community. We must ensure that this also remains true of Amtrak. We need to see that these disadvantaged areas develop in sync with the money that is being spent. We just want to make sure that the information is there so they can compete on a fair basis. My bill and this amendment is a chance to invest in our intercity passenger rail service and spur innovation. growth. and investment in the surrounding communities. I encourage the adoption of my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140027412,Thank you. Mr. JONES. I just want to point out. again. that this is bipartisan. Mr. JONES is a Republican. I am a Democrat. We both see the corrosive influence of money here in Washington. and we want to do something about it. A lot of our colleagues agree with us wholeheartedly but are actually afraid to say it. They are afraid to get up here because they know. if they do. they are going to be targeted by this special interest money. by superPAC money. by dark money. The sad thing is that you dont know that it is coming. You could be running a good. solid. healthy campaign arguing the issues and. all of a sudden. see a $2 million television ad against you. and they would be going after you for very personal misleading ads. which could destroy you and your family. for no reason other than you dont want to see so much money in campaign spending. Let me look at some of the specific risks and problems that we see today because of the way campaigns are financed. First of all. campaign financing makes elected officials less effective in their jobs because of the time you have to spend raising money. Here in Congress. it is not unusual to see a Member of Congress spend 2. 4. 6 hours a day on the phone. begging people for money. That lessens your effectiveness. You cant spend the time you should be spending on studying legislation. in talking to colleagues. in finding ways to compromise on issues. The second item is negative campaign ads turn off voters and suppress votes. Boy. we saw in this last election a turnout of 40 percent. 35 percent. and 30 percent in some districts. and a lot of that has to do with the negativity that people see on TV. They dont know what to believe. They think they are both bums. and they just close their noses and vote for the least worse or they dont vote at all. That is the second. The effect of campaign financing makes for wasteful government spending. This is an issue that. I think. folks like my predecessor here tonight was talking about. The Tea Party folks should be interested in this issue because the way campaigns are financed causes wasteful government spending. Boy. I will tell you that I sympathize with the Tea Party objectives. Government seems big. It seems wasteful. It seems loaded. It seems ineffective. There is wasteful spending. There are projects that shouldnt be funded. A lot of that has to do with the way campaigns are financed. The next one is a big one. This is important. It is kind of what I mentioned before. It is the threat of negative campaign ads causes elected officials to avoid important and controversial issues: Now. I do not care if you are a Republican or a Democrat. If you are a Republican. you have risk in your primary elections. If you are a Democrat. it is of big money coming in and trying to trash you personally in election campaigns. If you are a Democrat. you have more risk coming in in general elections. So it doesnt matter what party you are in. It doesnt matter whether you are conservative or liberal. The way campaigns are financed is causing our government to be wasteful. and it is causing it to be ineffective. I think that needs to be improved. There is another problem that I mentioned earlier. Foreign money is coming into these campaigns now. Do you want to see foreigners. do you want to see folks from Russia or from China or from any country besides the United States having an influence on our elections? The amount of money coming into elections continues to grows election by election. We had $6.2 million in 2010 versus $3 billion in 2012. I think I have gotten a million or a billion mixed up there. Sorry about that. Elected officials respond more to wealthy donors than they do to nonwealthy donors. It is simply a matter of access. Someone gives you money. and they are more likely to have access. and that means that you are more likely to be sympathetic to their legislative goals. Judicial races are getting more expensive and tainted as well. Do you want to have a judge in a case that you may be bringing to court to have gotten his seat or her seat because of the way the campaign finance trashed his opponent? I do not think so. In general. people have become very cynical about government because of the negative advertising. and people lose faith in our government. To have the greatest country in the world and the things that this country has accomplishedthe innovation. the science. the freedoms that we have established throughout the worldand then have people cynical about our government because of the campaign financing is more than a tragedy. Campaign spending is a zerosum game. Let me tell you what I mean by that. Consider that you are in a meeting. You have got a 1 hour. and you have got 12 people. so everyone has 5 minutes to speak. Now. what if somebody takes 10 minutes? Then somebody else is going to lose out. Campaignspeak is like that too because people in this country are only willing to listen to a certain amount of campaign rhetoric. and then after that point. they turn off their minds. They dont want to hear any more. The folks with the biggest money get out there. They fill the airwaves. and they fill your mailboxes. and they have people knock on your doors. Pretty soon. you dont want to hear any more. so the guy with the lesser money is losing freedom of speech. So I think it is a freedom of speech issue. Those are some of the issues I have. With PACs and Super PACs and dark moneythis is an interesting onecampaigns are no longer going to be controlled by the candidates. You could have a situation in which Super PACs and PACs have five times more money than the candidate himself or herself. in which case they are controlling all of the levers in the campaign. So those are some of the issues that. I think. are caused by the excessive spending in our campaigns. I again yield to the gentleman from North Carolina to take up the case here.
1140027414,I thank the gentleman. I dont know of anyone who has more integrity in this institution than you do. so I am honored that you would come down here and talk with me tonight about this important issue. Now. the American people. as far as I can tell. are clearly in favor of reducing campaign money. campaign spending. I have some Gallup Poll numbers here that were taken by The Huffington Post from November 7 through November 9. 2014. which was during the last election or right after the last election. The first question: Would you support or oppose amending the Constitution to give Congress more power to create restrictions on campaign spending? In favor of that was 53 percent. opposed was 23 percent. and not sure was 22 percent. So it was a very strong majority in favor of a constitutional amendment like I am going to discuss in a little while. The second question: Do you think limiting contributions to political campaigns helps to prevent corruption in politics. or does it have no impact on corruption? The question is will corruption be curtailed by limiting campaign spending. The answer that it helps prevent corruption: 52 percent. no impact on corruption: 28 percent. and not sure: 20 percent. Again. people feel strongly about this issue. The last question that I will read is: Which of the following statements do you agree with more: Elections are generally won by the candidate who raises the most money? The answer is 59 percent of Americans believe that. 18 percent dont believe that. and 23 percent are unsure. So I think this is a strong issue that we should be talking about. How do we move forward? Unfortunately. the Supreme Court appears to have a strong bias toward more money in politics. and it has consistently issued rulings to that effect. The Supreme Court even sought out. they even asked for. the infamous Citizens United case to be brought forward to them. Then. ultimately. they ruled that corporations have the same rightsfree speechas individual citizens do. as individual people do. The meaning of that decision is that corporations can use their treasuries to finance campaigns. I cant think of anything more corrosive or destructive to our democracy than that. The system was already bad before the Citizens United decision. but this thing made it much worse. Unfortunately. the Citizens United decision is just one of a series of decisions that allows more and more money into politics. and I truly believe that this is a threat to our cherished democratic and republican institutions. This trend is not confined to the Supreme Court. Earlier this year. the Republicancontrolled Senate. in concurrence with the Republicancontrolled House of Representatives. passed legislation that increased the total individuals could contribute to political parties by a factor of 10going from $35.000 to over $300.000. What can we do about it? The good news is that there are really a number of very good ideas that have been proposed. and I think it is important for us to go over some of those ideas. My friend WALTER JONES has mentioned JOHN SARBANES idea. and I will go into that in a little bit of detail. But there are others. and I think it is important that the American people be aware of some of these proposals out there and what they might offer and to let them decide. let the American people decide. Do they want to see a legislative approach like JOHN SARBANES great approach?-I support itor a constitutional amendment like mine and others that I will bring up as we go forward tonight? These proposals all have merit. They are all worth studying and thinking about. and I would be happy to support any of the ones that I am going to talk about this evening and to consider other ones that may not have been brought forward yet. The proposals. again. fall into two categorieslegislative proposals and constitutional amendments. Legislative proposals are a little bit easier to enact. but they are subject to Supreme Court and lower court overturning. So you can work hard. and you can get it passed and then have the Supreme Court or some other court overturn it. The constitutional amendment has a very high bar. It is very difficult to get a constitutional amendment passed. and it should be. You dont want people just willynilly passing an amendment to change the Constitution. It requires a twothirds vote in the House of Representatives. a twothirds vote in the Senate. and threequarters of the State legislatures throughout the country to pass that amendment for it to become part of the Constitution. but once it becomes part of the Constitution. the courts cant touch it. They can interpret it. but they cant overturn it. There is legislation that I would like to talk about. but some of my colleagues who were going to be here tonight couldnt be because of a change in schedule. I think one of the important approaches. mostly championed by CHRIS VAN HOLLEN from Maryland. is the disclosure and transparency approach. which is that people who donate ought to be disclosed quickly and broadly so that people know where money is coming from. That is a very important idea. Also. Government By the People. JOHN SARBANES approach. which I will talk about in a little while. and there is also legislation that would create public finance. and I think that is a very good approach. too. There are two constitutional amendments. one by DONNA EDWARDS. a colleague of mine from Maryland. that overturns Citizens United. and there is one by TED DEUTCH. a colleague of mine from Florida. TED DEUTCH from Florida would basically allow Congress to enact laws on campaign financing that could not be overturned by the Supreme Court. I think that is a good approach. I support that. In theory. it has got a beauty to it. Then there is my approach. which basically would eliminate PACs and do other things. I would like to talk in some detail about my resolution now. and we will get the board up to talk about it. This is called H.J. Res. 31. and again. it is a proposed constitutional amendment. As you can see. it has four parts. The first part. I think. is probably the most important. and it says basically that money that comes in to political election campaigns to support or oppose a candidate for office can only come from individual citizens and only go to the campaign controlled by the candidate or the principal campaign controlled by the candidate or from a system of public election financing. So what does that mean? That means that when money comes in. it can only come from individual citizens. It cant come from corporations. it cant come from any other sources. It just comes from individual citizens. and it can only go to the campaign controlled by the candidate. That means that it cant go to political action committees. PACs. it cant go to superPACs. it cant be dark money. The only money that can influence elections directly or indirectly to support or oppose a candidate has to come from individual citizens. It has to go only to the candidate. to the campaign controlled by the candidate. That is a very strong requirement. It is probably the strongest requirement out there right now. but I think it is important. By the way. the first requirement applies to elections for individual candidates at all levels of government. from the President on down to the Congress. the Senate. State governments. city governments. and so on. The second measure is similar to the first. This requirement. money to support or oppose a State ballot initiative to change a State constitution or for other purposes can only come from individuals who are able to vote for the measure or from a system of public election financing. I think that is important because you have ballot initiatives in my home State of California. for example. and you see millions of dollars coming in from out of State. Why would somebody from out of State have an opportunity to influence a State ballot initiative in California? I think it is wrong. and I think that this would take care of that problem. The third requirement is that Congress. the States. and the local jurisdictions must establish limits that an individual can contribute to any one election campaign. including limits on the amount a candidate may contribute to his or her own campaign. Now. for that particular requirement. we already have that in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. The limit at this point in time is $2.700 per election. So every time your voters can go to the booth for you. people can contribute. individuals can contribute $2.700. so the primary election and the general election. In the House of Representatives elections are every 2 years. so you can collect an amount of $5.400 over the election cycle for your campaign. Now. if you collect $5.400 before the primary and you lose the primary. then you are going to have to give back the money that was donated for the general election. So that would be you would have to give $2.700 back to the donors that gave that to you. Also. it is important that it requires governments to limit the amount a candidate can spend on their own campaign. Some of our candidates are extremely wealthy. They have millions or hundreds of millions or more. They can buy their seat in Congress easily. and this would limit that. I think. again. this is very. very important. The last is probably one of the more controversial of the four. but it says that the total of contributions to a candidates campaign from individuals who are not able to vote for the candidate cannot be greater than the total of contributions from individuals who can vote for the candidate. Now. geographically what that would mean is that money coming from outside of your congressional district. or from your State if you are a Senator. cant exceed money that comes from inside your district if you are a congressional candidate or State if you are a Senator. It wouldnt affect the Presidential race as much because everybody in the United States is in the Presidents district. but it would also affect local districts as well. With that. that wraps up the discussion of my proposed constitutional amendment. I want to talk a little bit about JOHN SARBANES bill. and I think it is a fine bill. It is not a constitutional amendment. What it does is it gives you a tax credit for money that you can contribute to a campaign. So if you can contribute $50 to a campaign. then you get a tax credit of $50. which means money back on your income tax return. the same amount that you contribute. you get back. But also it matches that contribution by 6 to 1. So you will end up giving the candidate quite a bit more than you are actually contributing. It is a good measure. It is a good proposal. It would sort of even out the effect of PACs. I find myself supporting that. Again. my colleague. TED DEUTCH. has a couple of constitutional amendments in the 114th Congress. One of them is called Democracies for All. H.J. Res. 119. and also H.J. Res. 22 that creates funding limits and creates a distinction between individuals and corporations. but what it really does is allows Congress to limit. to enact laws that will be enforceable and not overturned by the Supreme Court. We have VAN HOLLEN in the 114th Congress. H.R. 430. and what this does is it requires disclosure so that when campaign contributions are made. we can determine who made those contributionsvery important. I think it would make a big difference. Then we have a number of proposals to create public financing. My colleague from Kentucky. JOHN YARMUTH. had one in the 113th Congress. Fair Elections Now Act. In the 114th Congress. which is this Congress. DAVID PRICE has H.R. 424. which establishes a system of public financing. These are all good. I think I would be supportive of any of these kinds of approaches. I think the American public needs to be protected. I think our cherished Democratic and Republican institutions are a threat here. whether it is because candidates are bombarded by negative ads. whether it is because candidates are influenced by big donors. whether it is because more and more money is coming in to these elections every single cycle. There is a lot of reasons why we need to look at campaign financing and select one of these approaches and go with it and change the system that we have to a system that really does respond to the American public. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140035260,Mr. Speaker. this afternoon. I am going to talk about campaign finance reform. First of all. though. I want to say that the United States of America is the greatest country in the world. You can see by our economic dominance. by our cultural dominance. and by our military power. But we face some very big challenges. Unless we are able to tackle those challenges. our dominance may be in peril. Some of those challenges are climate change. global competitiveness. We need to make sure our manufacturing is up to par and can compete with any country on Earth. We have a vanishing middle class. which is very devastating to our country. We have a crumbling infrastructure. We also need to work on our educational system. But I can tell you. it is very difficult to attack any of these problems in a serious way with the current system of campaign financing. So let me go over some of the problems with campaign financing in our current system: First of all. you can see on the list here. campaign financing makes elected officials less effective because of the amount of time that we must spend raising money for the next election. which leaves less time to work on the issues that need to move our country forward. The campaign money fuels negative campaign ads that turn off voters and suppress vote turnout. Campaign financing causes wasteful government spending on programs that big donors want to see out there. The threat of negative campaign addsand this is very corrosivecauses elected officials to avoid taking stands and leadership on important issues. and this reduces the effectiveness of our government institutions. Nowadays. even our judicial races are becoming expensive and tainted by the influence of money. Next. people have become cynical about the government and disillusioned about the United States of America because. in part. of negative advertising. Next. the superPACs and dark money coming into campaigns are no longer controlled by the candidates on the ballot. Lastlyand I think this is very importantexcessive election spending drowns out free speech. If you look at campaign ads. what is happening is that the Big Money comes in. buys all the campaign ad time on TV. and floods our mailboxes with literature. People are only going to listen to so much campaign rhetoric. so they turn it off. The people with the most money are the ones who are listened to. and the ideas of the folks without much money are never heard. They dont ever get very far. I think this is a very critical issue. We see the problems that we have with the current system. but how do we change it? There are some very big challenges that we face in terms of changing the current campaign financing system. First of all. the Supreme Court of the United States of America has shown a very strong bias in the last decade or so toward putting more money in politics. That is right. The Supreme Court has made it so that more money is coming into politics and election campaigns every single year. The Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court ruled that corporations have the same free speech rights as people. allowing corporations to use their treasuries to finance campaigns. I cant think of anything that would be more corrosive to campaigns than to see a plethora of corporate and union money coming in with no controls and controlling the message. In fact. just this year. the Republicans in the House and the Senate passed legislation that increases the total that an individual American citizen can contribute to political parties almost by a factor of 10. going from $35.000 to $300.000. so an individual can donate $300.000 to a political campaign. yet there is significant public support for taking money out of politics. According to a June 2015 New York TimesCBS poll. 84 percent of Americans say money has too much influence in politics. and 85 percent of those surveyed said that the campaign financing system should be either completely rebuilt or fundamentally changed. The growth of money in politics represents a threat to our cherished democratic institutions that were built by our Founding Fathers. This is not what the American people want for our democracy. It is critical to inform the American public about what is happening and what can be done about the problem. There are reform options of two kinds. The first kind is legislative reform actions. and there are three or four types of those. The first and most important is disclosure and transparency. and then there are constitutional amendments. Constitutional amendments are very hard to pass. but they are not subject to be overturned by the Supreme Court. I have a proposed constitutional amendment. H.J. Res. 31. which will do away with PACs and superPACs. I hope the American public will examine those alternatives and decide what they want to see because our system is in desperate need of change.
1140038806,Mr. Chairman. although I had planned to withdraw my amendment. I feel it is important to discuss the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds and the benefits these funds provide to our Nation. Droughts are becoming more severe. which is putting an incredible strain on our water supply in California. and in my district. where we are experiencing a historic drought for the last 4 years. We have to manage our available water in smart and efficient ways. We lose an estimated 7 billion gallons of water a day from leaking pipes. with some cities losing as much as 30 percent of their water. At the same time. these cracks expose the water supply to an increasing number of waterborne diseases and contaminants. This means utilities face considerable challenges as they try to provide both adequate and safe drinking water to families and businesses. Upgrading our infrastructure would save trillions of gallons of water a year and make our water safer to drink. but the best part is that. according to the American Water Works Association. there are already enough shovelready water projects around the United States that would create work for more than 400.000 Americans. including almost 90.000 direct construction jobs. These are jobs that would be welcomed with open arms in our towns and cities across the United States. Our Nations water infrastructure is in desperate need of repair. According to an infrastructure needs survey by the EPA. nearly $335 billion worth of repairs. upgrades. and replacements are needed by water systems in the next 20 years to continue providing safe drinking water and protecting public health. Almost $300 billion is needed to repair and replace wastewater and storm water pipes and treatment plants. Furthermore. the National Association of Clean Water Agencies and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies estimate that utilities will need to spend $448 billion to $944 billion by 2050 just to deal with climate change impacts. Considering the significant water infrastructure needs our country is facing. the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds have never been more important. These funds help finance projects that handle and treat domestic sewage and storm water and deliver drinking water to homes and businesses. These infrastructure investments also create jobs and have a positive impact on the economy well beyond the amount spent. Unfortunately. the bill proposes significantand I want to repeat thatsignificant reductions to drinking water SFRs and over a $400 million cut in the Clean Water Act sewage treatment SFRs. The Nations water infrastructure needs already exceed the available funding. and cutting the revolving funds by this much means that a greater number of deserving community projects will not be able to get done. This approach will only imperil our infrastructure and our healthy communities that it helps foster. Congress should commit to providing the necessary funding to maintain and upgrade our Nations ailing water infrastructure and make sure that the green infrastructure is a critical part of that process. My State of California is doing its best to cope with a severe and ongoing drought. and Congress must do its best to fund and support the needed infrastructure and water quality enhancements that preserve our precious water resources and create a sustainable system. Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California?
1140043219,Mr. Chairman. my amendment is simple and straightforward but addresses a critical issue affecting the economy. the environment. and the health of the delta as well as other regions throughout the State. This amendment adds water hyacinth to the list of invasive species to be considered for a pilot project established by the bill. The water hyacinth is an extremely invasive weed that has taken over the delta. Take a look at the picture. This channel is completely blocked over by the weed. It can double in size every 10 days. It has seeds that remain buried in sediment and remain viable for 20 years. It is difficult to remove mechanically and to manage through pesticides. The result is what you see here in this picture. It clogs waterways. preventing the movement of water through the delta. It negatively affects farmers. recreational opportunities. and disrupts the national ecosystem. These effects have only been worsened by the drought. I represent the Port of Stockton. This is the third largest inland port in the Nation. The hyacinth affects traffic in and out of the port. preventing navigation of the channels at night because of ships that cant navigate between the weeds. the levees. and smaller vessels. This causes unreasonable delays and costs importers approximately $200.000 in additional expenses per year. Last year alone. the port had to remove more than 2 million tons of the plants. Even Stocktons Christmas lighted boat parade had to be canceled for the first time in its 35year history. Eradicating this invasive species will take a holistic approach. involving stakeholders at all levels. I have heard from the marina owners. farmers. environmental organizations. and local communities on how the water hyacinth continues to impact their lives on a daily basis. I was fortunate enough to help secure $1 million in Federal funding to help an existing effort between Federal. State. and local partners focused on managing the water hyacinth infestation. but these efforts are just the beginning. This amendment ensures that we continue building off the current work. I would like to thank my colleagues.
1140095518,just talked in detail about the necessity of building additional infrastructure for water. We need Sites Reservoir in the northern part of the State. We need to rebuild the San Luis Reservoir. and the Los Banos Grandes needs to be built. We need to build the infrastructure. the recycling. and all of the other things. We do not need to take. as this bill does. the Endangered Species Act. the Clean Water Act. and the biological opinions and push them out of the way and just allow the pumps to turn on. That is not a solution. That is a solution for the destruction of the largest estuary on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere. I dont doubt for a moment the sincerity of my colleagues from the San Joaquin Valley and from southern California. They are sincere about the concern. and we share that concern. 300.000 acres of my rice farm didnt get planted this last year because of the drought. We also know the damage that a drought can do. but there is a way of solving this problem. This is not the bill. This bill will set off a war. Obviously. we are already at it here on the floor of the House. Lets put this aside. Lets sit down. as we can do. and develop a solution that keeps in place the environmental laws and allows the flexibility that is present within those laws to be used to the maximum extent and not push the laws and the biological opinions out of the way to the detriment of the largest estuary on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere. It is critical for salmon and other species in the ocean as well as for the agriculture in the delta and the 4 million or 5 million people who depend upon that water from the delta. I ask my colleagues to work with all of us. and I will take the chair of the subcommittee up on his offer. I will take the gentleman up on his offer and sit down with him. and we will work this out. but not in this way. at this moment on this floor. with a bill that really does gut the environmental laws and that guts the environmental species as well as the Clean Water Act.
1140102463,Mr. Speaker. I rise to speak in support of H.R. 4590. a bill to authorize funding for numerous Department of Veterans Affairs construction projects throughout the Nation. Funding for many of these projects was already appropriated in fiscal year 2016 but needs authorization. and this is what the bill does. I want to thank Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member BROWN for their work and commitment to our Nations veterans and for bringing this bill to the floor. The VA is currently challenged by a growing backlog in construction projects and old infrastructure. The VA manages over 6.000 buildings and nearly 34.000 acres of land. Additionally. more than 4.000 critical infrastructure gaps remain. which are estimated to cost between $56 billion and $68 billion to close. A growing backlog in construction projects and infrastructure is leading veterans to have to wait too long to receive the care they need and deserve. This list of construction projects is also one of the reasons I have introduced H.R. 4129. the Jumpstart VA Construction Act. This bill provides for publicprivate partnerships at the VA to expedite construction opportunities at the VA. H.R. 4129 will help maximize partnerships between Federal and nonFederal entities and ensure that we avoid the systemic problems that have plagued the VA in the past. projects like Denver and Orlando. Meanwhile. H.R. 4590 also includes funding for the Livermore realignment project. as was mentioned by the chairman and ranking member. This is a project that is very important to the veterans of the Central Valley of California. including my district. This funding would provide for the construction of a 158.000squarefoot communitybased outpatient clinic in French Camp. California. While vets have been waiting for years. I fought for this project for at least 8 years. The French Camp communitybased outpatient clinic will serve 87.000 veterans across a wide geographic area that includes San Joaquin. Stanislaus. Calaveras. Tuolumne. and Alameda Counties. among others. Californias Central Valley veterans confront many obstacles accessing the care they need from the VA. I want to tell you a little story. In Stockton. California. it is about a 3hour commute to the nearest VA center. which is in Palo Alto. The commute takes long because it is a distance and because there is tremendous traffic. I took the ride along with one of our veterans a couple of years ago. and it took all day to go in for a halfhour appointment. Now. not every elderly gentleman can sit in a car for 3 hours one way and then 3 hours back. This is a real hardship. Not only can they not sit in a car for that long. but they may not even have that kind of transportation. So this is very important. I am sure that all of these projects have that kind of a story. We need more facilities. We need this authorization. Congress approved the Central Valley communitybased outpatient clinic and community center in 2004 as part of the VAs Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services initiatives. In 2010. Congress appropriated $55 million for land acquisition and to fund construction and planning. The project is ready to begin construction. and our Central Valley veterans are eager to see progress on a project that was promised to them in 2004. The French Camp outpatient clinic would offer an array of services: primary care. mental health care. radiology. audiology. physical and occupational therapy. dental. and other specialty services throughout the telehealth system. Veterans have sacrificed so much to protect our freedom and democracy. They deserve access to stateoftheart healthcare facilities closer to home. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4590.
1140105311,"Mr. Chair. Americans overwhelmingly agree that online privacy is a fundamental right. According to the Pew Research Center. a large majority of Americans wants the government to do more to protect their privacy. Consumers want a voice in how their data is shared and sold. Despite this loud cry from the American people that we in Congress do more. this amendment would do less. It would make it harder for consumers to decide how their data is treated. Let me reread the amendment: ""None of the funds made available by this Act can be used to implement. administer. or enforce any of the rules proposed pursuant to section 222 of the Communications Act."" These are privacy protection rules. These are rules that are meant to protect consumers privacy. If this amendment becomes law. consumers will have little or no choice as to how their Internet service providers sell our most personal data. We need strong rules to protect consumers most sensitive information. and we need those rules to be enforced. American consumers need to choose for themselves whether their locations. their search histories. or their purchasing habits. including medical equipment. should be sold. traded. or otherwise used without their permission. I believe that consumers who consistently demand greater privacy protection online would oppose this amendment. which takes away their protections. My Republican colleagues claim that the FCCs proposed rules for privacy protection will confuse consumers. but lets be clear. The data shows that consumers are already confused when it comes to privacy. Just a few weeks ago. Georgetown law professor Paul Ohm testified before the Communications and Technology Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee that privacy in the U.S. has never been uniformly controlled. For example. there are sectorspecific privacy laws for consumers health. credit. and educational information. This is not to mention the 50State patchwork of State privacy laws all across this country. Consumers want to be heard. They want more privacy. We have an obligation to respond to their requests by opposing this amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chair. I reserve the balance of my time."

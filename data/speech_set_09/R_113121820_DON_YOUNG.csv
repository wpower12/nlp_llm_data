1130018815,"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. last year. Jan Scruggs. president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. came to my office and told me about an absurd fundraising problem he had. He told me that in order to build a muchneeded education center at the Vietnam Wall. he had to raise nearly $100 million of private money. Normally. this would not be a big problem. however. in this case. VVMF had to raise all of this $100 million without the ability to recognize their donors because current law did not allow donor recognition. Mr. Speaker. I think we can agree that it is ridiculous to force any organization to fundraise without the ability to recognize donors. How are we supposed to raise any money? Even the National Park Service understands the importance of donor recognition. I personally have seen hundreds of benches in national parks all across this country that have little metal plaques on them thanking people for their generous donations. In spite of current law and this donor recognition handicap. VVMF has raised over 25 percent of the nearly $100 million needed to build this education center. My bill. H.R. 588. will give them the extra pulling power they need to quickly complete their fundraising and finally cross the $100 million finish line. Overall. my bill is very straightforward. It merely provides VVMF the ability to recognize their donors. This recognition will lead to larger donations. a faster fundraising pace. and quick and timely construction of the education center. It will also make the act of giving more personal and more rewarding. Put simply. every donor deserves a ""thank you."" and my bill will finally allow VVMF to give the ""thank you"" their donors so rightly deserve. Also. in order to ensure that appropriate standards for donor recognition were met. I made sure that H.R. 588 dovetailed exactly with existing Parks Service guidelines. This regulatory overlap ensures that any donor recognition will be discreet. unobtrusive. and will not contain any advertising or company logos. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 588 is supported by numerous veterans organizations. including the VFW. the American Gold Star Mothers. the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. among many others. I urge my colleagues to support the quick passage this bill. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130029794,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. over a month ago. the House passed the Vietnam Veterans Donor Acknowledgment Act by a resounding vote of 3982. Unfortunately. a couple of weeks ago. the Senate substantially changed this bipartisan and noncontroversial piece of legislation. Instead of only allowing donor recognition at a soontobebuilt Vietnam Veterans Education Center. the Senate changed the bill to allow donor recognition. across the entire Mall. on all future commemorative works. While I am not fundamentally opposed to this idea. neither the House nor the Senate has done any hearings to consider the implications of this issue. In fact. neither the House nor the Senate has done a markup on this issue to allow Members to add their input. Mr. Speaker. put simply. this is just a poor legislative process. and the American people deserve better. Today. we are here to undo what the Senate has done and to. once again. send the Senate a bipartisan and noncontroversial bill. Todays resolution merely strikes the Senate language that allows donor recognition across The Mall and reinserts my original language from H.R. 588. This language has been through the full committee process and is sound legislative text. However. not all of the Senate additions are bad. In this bill. we will keep one portion of the Senates language. which extends the legislative authority to construct the Vietnam Veterans Education Center from 2014 until 2018. It is unfortunate that we must provide this extension. though. Our Nations Vietnam veterans have waited too long for this education center. It is a shame that a long line of political gamesmanship has delayed its construction. Mr. Speaker. after the Vietnam War. many of our Nations bravest were welcomed home not with joyous cheers or words of thanks. but dirty looks and snide remarks. Let us end these political games. I call upon my colleagues in the House. but especially on my colleagues in the Senate. to quickly pass this resolution so this education center can finally be built. I think we can all agree that this legislation and this center are a long time coming.
1130062213,Madam Chairman. it is amazing as I sit on this floor after 40 years of listening to so much nonsense from the other side when it comes to energy. This increase of production in the United States came from private lands and State lands. not the Federal lands. and those are the facts. And we are still not independent from oil from the Middle East that caused us disruption in our economy. To hear the same litany of words over and over again. we have to save. we cant produce. but we have to have employment. We will have a stimulus package. And. in fact. we will have more government borrowing for the economy and forget real jobs. But I am going to talk about title V in this legislation. The Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act contains a number of measures to promote energy development by and for the benefit of Indians and Alaska Natives. Specifically. title V contains a range of measures requested by a number of Indian tribes and Alaska Native corporations to streamline burdensome Federal regulations and legal procedures that hinder exploration. development. and production of energy on their lands. There are 56 million acres of lands held in trust by the Federal Government for the benefit of Indians. 56 million. In Alaska. there are 44 million acres. a total land mass larger than the State of California. Many of these areas are in untapped energy resources. It is estimated that up to 10 percent or more of our Nations energy is contained in Native lands. The problem is that outdated Federal policies thwart the ability of tribes to use their lands for their benefit. Leases of Indian trust lands require Federal review and approval. which arguably brings little or no value to the tribes involved. If Federal review and approval of energy leases created any economic value. then private landowners and State governments would be clamoring to have their projects reviewed and approved by the Federal Government. too. There are few better measures of how ineffective Federal supervision of Indian affairs has been than the fact that since 2010 nearly $5 billion has been paid by the government to Indians to settle Federal mismanagement of their trust lands. While many Indian tribes and Alaska Native corporations have made great strides in building businesses and strengthening their economies. tribal communities remain at the bottom of nearly every economic and social indicator. The sad fact is in 21stcentury America. severe poverty wears a Native face. Instead of helping tribes make positive strides in energy development. the Obama administration is erecting new hurdles. The EPA canceled a valid permit for the largest tribe to operate a large power plant on its land with its coal. The Department of the Interior has proposed a hydraulic fracturing rule which makes Indian lands less competitive and less attractive to industry. again. taking away from the American Indians. Fortunately. several tribes are seeking to shed the current Federal system altogether and to take over management of their lands and energy resources. It is these tribes which asked for the provisions in title V of the bill today. It is with great pleasure that the standalone bill on which title V is based. H.R. 1548. has been endorsed by the National Congress of American Indians and several individual tribes. It is time to stop treating Indian trust lands as public landsthey are not public lands. they are private landsand increase tribes powers of selfgovernance over their energy resources for the good of their members and for the good of the United States energy security.
1130073238,Mr. Chair. I am interested in title IV in this legislation. which is a good piece of legislation. The provision in title IV of H.R. 3590 has the support of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the President of the United States. This provision is the Polar Bear Conservation and Fairness Act. It is a bipartisan measure that would make a very limited fix to an issue that affects a number of hunters nationwide. Prior to the threatened listing of the worldwide polar bear population on May 15. 2008. there were a number of hunters that took hunting trips to Canada under Canadian law and United States law. These hunters followed all the rules at the time and were prevented from bringing in their polar bear trophy due to the threatened listing triggering an importation ban under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. My legislation. H.R. 3590. will allow the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits to only those qualified hunters with legally taken polar bear trophies prior to the May listing date. This legislation will allow up to 41 hunters to import their trophies from Canada. As a result. roughly $41.000 would be available to the United StatesRussia Polar Bear Conservation Fund to support conservation activities for the shared polar bear population. This is a provision that would bring in revenue for conservation activities that otherwise would not be funded. As a result. I urge Members to support this legislation and keep in fact these are dead polar bears in storage hunted legally under the premise of Canadian law and United States law. This is a good part of this bill. By the way. speaking of this bill. it is a good bill. From the State of Alaska are more parks and more refuges than any other State. The Refuge Department doesnt allow us to hunt on refuges in many areas. The Park Service definitely doesnt allow us to hunt. I am arguing that the park and refuge areas are set aside for the refuge managers themselves and not for the people of America. let alone the people of Alaska. This legislation is the right way to go. Lets think about public lands. not the kings lands. not the administrations lands. but the lands of the people. This bill is a good bill. I urge the passage of this legislation. The Acting CHAIR . The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore assumed the chair.
1130074155,Mr. Chairman. the Alaska Native Allotment Act allowed Alaska Natives to acquire up to 160 acres of Federal land. Approximately 2.800 Alaska Natives served in the military during the Vietnam War. and because of their absence. they did not have an opportunity to apply for their Native allotment. In 1998. Congress passed a law that provided certain Alaska Native Vietnam veterans an opportunity to obtain an allotment. One of my constituents. Mr. William Alstrom. applied for an allotment in accordance with this law. During the war. he served honorably in the Air Force. Mr. Alstrom is a lifelong resident of St. Marys. Alaska. a village of roughly 550 mostly Yupik Eskimo residents located on the Lower Yukon River in southwestern Alaska. His family has a long history in the region. helping to settle the area and operating the first general store. During World War II. Mr. Alstroms father. Fred. was a member of the Alaska Territorial Guard. or the Eskimo Scouts. a military reserve component of the U.S. Army organized in 1942. Following a TB outbreak in 1954. Mr. Alstrom was sent to a boarding school in southeast Alaska with many other children from Alaska villages. As the Vietnam War was escalating. he graduated from one of these boarding schools and promptly enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. serving his country. Soon thereafter. he left his wife and two children stateside and headed to southeast Asia. During the war. the newly minted Sergeant Alstrom served in Thailand. preparing aircraft on their way to strike North Vietnam. On completion of his service. William and his family returned home to St. Marys. where he invested himself in his village and continued to grow and raise his family. Today. William continues to servethis time as mayor of his community and president of his village corporation. In 2002. William applied for the Alaska Native veterans allotment he was entitled to by law. Following an extensive application and vetting process. in 2009. the Bureau of Land Management. BLM. deeded him two 80acre parcels located in the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. With his deed in hand. William transported lumber and other supplies to one of his parcels on his skiff. spent countless hours clearing trees and brush. and finally built a small cabin and fish camp for him and his family to enjoy. Out of the blue a few years later. the Fish and Wildlife Service realized that errors had been made by the Fish and Wildlife Service and BLM personnel. both in the surveying and application approval process. Instead of being located on general refuge lands. the two allotment parcels were located within the congressionally designated Andreafsky Wilderness Area. Conveying allotments in wilderness areas is prohibited by law. Similarly. making improvements to the land. such as constructing a cabin. cutting trees. or clearing bush. is also prohibited. As a result. the BLM canceled the deed to the two parcels. plunging this Alaska Native veteran and the status of his allotment and cabin into a state of limbo. After this decision. William contacted me for assistance. To their credit. the BLM quickly admitted that both they and the Fish and Wildlife Service screwed up. Though. after looking into their options. they also admitted that they couldnt fix their mistakes administratively. In an attempt to resolve the issue. the BLM offered William two parcels of equal size elsewhere in the region. While he agreed to accept one of the replacement parcels. the second proposed parcel excluded his cabin. My amendment today would approve his application for the second original parcel. subsequently saving his cabin and fish camp from demolition. Though two Federal agencies are at fault. my Alaska Native constituent is the one being forced to bear the full cost of their errors. The purpose of my amendment is simply to allow a veteran to retain the 80acre parcel with the cabin on it. at no cost to the taxpayer. An identical version of this amendment was adopted by voice vote when the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held their markup of the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act. of which the House version is included in todays package. As you well know. I am no proponent of the fact that the Federal Government is the landlord of well over 60 percent of my State. Think about this: 60 percent. I generally oppose wilderness areas. I have often had an adversarial relationship with Federal land management agencies. All of that aside. this amendment is not meant to make a statement for or against wilderness designations. but rather to fix a unique issue for a truly deserving Vietnam veteran. At its core. fixing issues like this is what we do well when we are sent to Washington. Mr. Alstrom. like his father before him. served this country with honor and dignity. and he deserves similar treatment from this government in return. I hope you will join me today in fixing this unfortunate mistake and allow this gentleman and his family to move on with their lives by supporting this simple amendment to H.R. 2954. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130085080,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman. The Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act includes a provision that I offered as an amendment on the House floor in February. The amendment to the omnibus Public Access and Lands Improvement Act passed the House by voice vote. and I am pleased it has come before the House again as part of the Senatepassed legislation. During the debate on that measure. I told a story that led to this provision. and how the Federal Government failed one of my constituents. Mr. William Alstrom. endangering his Alaska native veterans allotment and the cabin he and his family built on their own effort on his land the Federal Government conveyed to him and then took back due to a bureaucratic error. At its core. fixing issues like this is one we are all sent here to Washington to accomplish. and the way in which this has been fixed. merely months after I was first made aware of this issue. is an example of how Congress should function as we work together. Today. after the House sends S. 404 to the President. I am pleased that William and his family can put this headache behind them. and William can put his time to better use by continuing to serve St. Marys. Alaska. as mayor and president of his village corporation. May I. again. thank the chairman. the ranking member. the two Senators. and the total Larsen delegation for this legislation. especially recognizing the mudslide. But I hope we all recognize that the Federal Government is not a good manager of land. There are too many times that logic does not prevail and too many times they are being sued by interest groups that understand logic. I am suggesting respectfully. as the chairman has said. we ought to work together. both parties together. on solving land issues that are really created by our own governmentboth sides. I have been under eight Presidents. and I have watched these Presidents all not take into consideration individuals. their rights. their prerogatives. as free Americans. So I. again. thank you for the efforts put forth in this legislation. I commend the chairman and ranking member for the work they put forth. and God bless you.
1130104871,"I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. With all due respect to the gentleman offering this amendment. yes. we are one State. but if you took all of the land from the tip of Maine to the tip of Florida. from the Mississippi River over. that is part of Alaska. That is a big State. not a little State. like Ohio. This Commission has work. And I have to say one thing. it is being referred to as the ""IG report by Mr. Marshall""-totally incompetent. It has been unfounded. His finding was unfounded. In fact. we cant find him. We would like to find out where he is. He no longer exists. What he said about this Commission is totally inaccurate. It has worked. It will work. and we are a rural area. What it has done. one thing when it was created was to move the fuel tanks away from the waters that EPA said they couldnt be close to. These communities could not do that. and the process of the Federal Government and the other agencies. it would have taken too long. So we moved these fuel tanks across. And yes. it was used for clinics. and yes. it has been used for sewer and water. Fortyfour of our villages dont have water yet. dont have sewage. They carry ""honey buckets."" Why they call them ""honey buckets"" I have no idea. But this Commission is to take and provide the proper things for. just as your constituents use every day and take for granted. This Commission has worked. We want to keep the money. and I want to thank the chairman for understanding this. This amendment has been offered time and time again. And as he said. this is a very small amount of money. That is not what I am arguing. It is money well spent. If we dont spend it on this type thing to cut out the middleman. and they keep saying there are other agencies. That is not true. Those agencies do not function. Most of our agencies today do not function because there are too many layers and nothing gets to the constituent. nothing gets to solving the problem. So I am suggesting. and we have done some work on this. I asked for a GAO investigation. I did. to find if this has occurred. It has not been reported back to us yet. It will be. In fact. it will show that the IGs report is false. and that is one of the things I am looking forward to. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. It is time we accept the fact that this system works. as the other commissions do. for those communities that are less fortunate than the communities in which most people live in who are in this body. I come from a rural State. I want to serve my rural State. and I am sure the Commission does also."
1130106817,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I would like to go through history. The former chairman of the Infrastructure Committee on the last large highway bill. SAFETEALU. that was passed. I had a dear friend from Minnesota named Jim Oberstar who served beside me and worked with me to write that piece of legislation. Finally. he became the chairman. What is impressive about that. this gentleman had more knowledge about transportation probably than anyone in this House has ever had. including myself. I will tell you what was the biggest disappointment of his life is he wanted to write a transportation bill. a longterm transportation bill. and fund it. And guess who said no. Our President. Mr. Obama. His Secretary. a dear friend of mine. came down and said there is no way we are going to pass a longterm bill with full funding. He did not support Jim Oberstar. What I wanted to do was to fully fund it. and I was opposed then by the seated President. George W. Bush. In fact. if Mr. Oberstar had the opportunity. with the Senate being in the control of the Presidents party and the House being in the control of the Presidents party. we would not be here today. We would have infrastructure. bar none. We wouldnt be discussing what we are doing today. This measure today is a stopgap measure. But this Congress has to wake up. and the President should have woken up then when he had control to pass legislation for the infrastructure of this country. So. when we get accused on this side of not doing anything and making a stopgap measure. go back through history. This President has failed to recognize the importance. And for those interest groups. they should have been on him at that time in support of Mr. Oberstar. So. Mr. Speaker. I say respectfully. this is a twoway street. We have to understand this is a really important piece of legislation to keep us going. but then we have to solve it permanently. Lets be leaders on infrastructure. which we do not have down on Pennsylvania Avenue right now at this time.
1130107942,"Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan. Chairman CAMP. for his work on this important legislation. H.R. 4719. the America Gives More Act of 2014. is a package of bipartisan bills to improve or make permanent several tax rules governing charitable donations. Especially. I would like to speak to a provision in the bill concerning Alaska Native Corporations. Alaska Native Corporations generally pay Federal corporate tax at the highest marginal rate but are not able to take advantage of many of the corporate tax credits like the other corporations. Under the current Tax Code. the Federal Government provides favorable tax treatment for conservation easements donated by certain corporations owned by farmers and ranchers. Considering that in Alaska. Native corporation lands have high conservation value and lack access to many other corporate tax credits. it makes sense to extend these favorable tax benefits to Alaska Native corporations. I must make it clear this provision does not mandate the creation of conservation easement. but allows Alaska Native landholders to determine themselves which lands will be best suited. I strongly support this provision and underlying bill. Mr. Speaker. it is always interesting. We talk about our good chairmans proposal for tax reform. If I remember correctly. that side of the aisle criticized that tax reform badly. and did not do it when they were in the majority. They passed ObamaCare. they passed capandtrade. they passed the stimulus package. and they passed DoddFrank. They didnt address this issue of being fiscally responsible. That amazes me. Now I hear from that side ""be fiscally responsible."" Well. what we are trying to do here is give an extension for those who want to give instead of going through this Congress. Lets let the private individual be the one that is able to help his neighbor. not through a bureaucracy. I mean. it is amazing to me how this changes. how somebody on that side can say. well. we need reform. we need reform. and it was criticized by that side of the aisle. I want to compliment the chair again for his hard work. and especially my provision. Thank you. Mr. Chairman."

1130000482,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for his leadership on this legislation. His knowledge and years of experience on these issues have been critical to crafting this legislation and bringing it before the House for consideration today. I also want to thank Ranking Member NORTON. Ranking Member RAHALL. and former Chairman MICA for all of their work and support for these reforms. H.R. 219. the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. will save money and help devastated communities rebuild much faster than under current programs. However. in order to help those communities impacted by Sandy. the FEMA Administrator has made it very clear that these reforms must be signed into law by March 1. Many of these reforms were already passed by the House in September as part of H.R. 2903. There is also widespread and bipartisan support for these reforms in the Senate. In addition. this bill has strong support from key stakeholders and experts. representing emergency managers. State and local officials. and tribal communities. We know these reforms work. Chairman SHUSTER laid the groundwork in 2006 when his postKatrina reform act authorized FEMA to conduct a number of recovery pilot programs. The results are very clear. In each case. costs were dramatically reduced. projects were completed faster. and their process was much more efficient. For example. without making permanent the debris removal pilot program the taxpayer could end up paying six times the cost for debris removal. and it will take much longer. The individuals and households pilot program incorporated in this bill would reduce costs by a similar amount and make temporary housing available faster. In hearing after hearing before our committee. experts. FEMA. and the Office of the Inspector General have all testified communities will be rebuilt faster and taxpayers will save hundreds of millions of dollars with this bill. We know the current process is broken. and we finally know how to fix it. but we have to change the law by March or it will be too late to apply those lessons to the Sandy recovery. It has been nearly 8 years since Hurricane Katrina. and there are still projects that are unresolved. We dont want to have the same mistakes happen with Hurricane Sandy. These reforms will help address those programs. streamline the process. allow communities to rebuild faster and smarter. and save money. The provisions of H.R. 219 are proven and commonsense reforms that have bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130023745,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the chairman for the time to express my views on H.R. 3. which will generate numerous benefits to the Nation and its economic growth. This pipeline will create American jobs. enhance our energy independence. and strengthen our national security. I am proud to say that Im a cosponsor of this legislation because it represents a significant opportunity to create jobs and spur economic growth in our country. Furthermore. this bill will help the Nation become more energy independent. According to the Department of Energy. the pipeline will transport 830.000 barrels per day of oil from Canada to the gulf coast. totaling nearly half of our current daily imports from the Middle East. This bill makes these numerous project benefits a reality. What this boils down to is breaking through bureaucratic hurdles and making this project a priority. The southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline has already been approved. and this bill finishes the job. allowing construction of the northern route of the pipeline to move forward. This bill also ensures that the environment and its historic resources are protected. through the 5 years of studies that have already been completed on this project. Indeed. this has been the most studied project in our countrys history. It also ensures that the projects routing through Nebraska. the primary objection with the permit when it was denied in 2012. is the route chosen by the people of that State. Simply put. as President Obama said regarding the southern route. this bill ""cuts through the red tape."" The project is the most extensively studied and vetted pipeline project in the history of this country. Given the nearly 5 years of study and review of the Keystone XL projectwith four State Department environmental impact statements and over 15.000 pages of publicly released documentswe know the ins and outs and all about this pipeline. I believe in an allofthe -above energy strategy. and this legislation is one piece of that puzzle to break Americas dependency on overseas foreign oil. Finally. it is important to remember that this project will be built with private dollars and create thousands of private sector jobs. This project has passed through all three committees with bipartisan support. and I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130040287,Mr. Chairman. it is crucial in this time of limited budgets that we transfer funds from those programs which are either duplicative or ineffective to the highest priority uses for the Department. such as maintaining readiness and taking care of our personnel. With that in mind. I have introduced a limiting amendment to prohibit the Department of Defense from using funds to implement the TransRegional Web Initiative. This program consists of a series of general news Web sites that cater to foreign audiences. The Department requested $19.7 million to continue this effort during fiscal year 2014. An April 2013 GAO report found that the TRWI program lacks meaningful performance metrics and is poorly coordinated with other U.S. Government public diplomacy programs. I want to put this $19.7 million in perspective. With this money. the Army National Guard could have retained 2.000 soldiers of the 4.000 it has been forced to reduce from its end strength due to budget cuts. That is 2.000 guardsmen who could be supporting our active component. responding to natural disasters. or securing our border. Instead. that money is going to Web sites providing entertainment news and lifestyle advice to the Balkans and Middle East. It is important to remember that the United States already spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year in providing quality. independent journalism overseas through the Broadcasting Board of Governors. In fact. every week. more than 203 million listeners. viewers. and Internet users around the world engage with U.S. international broadcasting programs which are completely separate from the duplicative and expensive TRWI program. How can we possibly justify unnecessary and ineffective. duplicative measures by the Department of Defense? How can I tell someone in my district that he was furloughed but that we found the cash to pay for an article about the plight of child actors in Turkey? Our colleagues in the Senate have already acted. The Senate Armed Services Committee found that the costs to operate the Web sites are excessive. that the effectiveness of the Web sites is questionable. and that the performance metrics do not justify the expense. I want to thank Citizens Against Government Waste. Taxpayers for Common Sense. and the Project on Government Oversight for their support on this amendment. Mr. Chairman. in this time of limited Federal resources. we cannot afford to continue wasteful programs like this. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130070091,I thank the gentleman from California. I. as many other Californians at one time. supported the California highspeed rail project. It was initially supposed to be a $33 billion project with equal amounts coming not only from the California taxpayers. in the form of a bond. but also private investors and the Federal Government. Yet this $33 billion project has ballooned up to $100 billion. So what do they do for cost controls? They cut off the very legs that Mr. LAMALFA talked about. the section going to Sacramento. the section going to San Diego. but. still. it is a $68 billion project with a more than $26 billion hole just in the first initial operating segment alone. Tomorrow. as chair of the Subcommittee on Railroads. we will be discussing a review of the challenges facing Californias highspeed rail. I want to reiterate I believe that highspeed rail is our future. I believe that as a growing economy. with more trucks and goods movement on the road. with more goods movement on rail that we have to look at alternative opportunities to move people. Highspeed rail is one of those opportunities. But in Florida. a project that is being done by private investors will have no ongoing subsidy. They need no Federal dollars. Texas will have its own highspeed rail system. again. with private dollars. no ongoing subsidy. Yet here in California. you have a $68 billion project with no private investor. with huge subsidies and overruns. and a project that cannot even get out of the initial gate. So where we are today: California has no money to meet its Federal obligation. On November 14. we had a court decision that came back and said that they cannot spend the $9.95 billion that was approved by voters because they had failed to complete a full business plan. So with no dollars available. the Governor came out this week and said that we are going to use $250 million of the capandtrade dollars. capandtrade dollars that were supposed to be used for environmentally friendly projects. Yet this project is going to be a net polluter. a net polluter for at least the next 30 years. So how he could come up with a legality of using these capandtrade dollars I think is in question. But I think a bigger issue is a timing issue: $180 million is due April 1. The Antideficiency Act says that the State has to have its first set of matches. and that 50/50 match is due April 1. Yet the legislature is not even going to vote on this new budget and this theoretical $250 million in funds until. at the earliest. late June. California budgets usually come in in August. and I think it is a real question on whether liberals and conservatives can agree on whether or not this environmental money will be used on highspeed rail. But specifically on the operating segment. itself. the judge has said not only that they need to come up with the money on this initial construction segment. which stops in Bakersfieldso now we are going to have two sets of rail that stop in Bakersfield. and then you have to get on a bus to get across the Tehachapis. But they dont even have the funding for the initial operating section. which goes all the way to Palmdale. You wont be able to get the speed that they need going around. instead of through. the Tehachapis. and they have a $20 billion funding gap in that first segment. So some real questions: Are they going to meet the timeline of April 1? Is using the capandtrade dollars actually legal? And. third. this huge funding gap. where does that money come from? I think the Federal taxpayers across the Nation need to be asking the question. If you are going to subsidize all of Californias highspeed rail projects. where do the matching dollars come from? If they could use the $9.95 billion. it is still not enough money. So if California cant come up with the Federal match. what are the teeth that the Federal Government has to be able to hold California up to that Federal obligation? We have some real questions that are going to be coming out tomorrow. The FRA has altered its approach. Once they realized that they couldnt do a 50/50 match. they went to a tapered match. That means that the Federal Government is going to come in with their money first. and then. hopefully. someday the State will come up with its matching dollars in a tapered manner. That tapered manner is coming through April 1. That is when that first $180 million is obligated. But I think the real question is. Who is making these decisions? Did this go all the way up to the President? Was the past Department of Transportation Secretary or the new Department of Transportation Secretary involved in this decision? And if California cant come up with this tapered match. will they. once again. adjust this outside of Congress a second time? So we have some real questions on what those legalities are. The next question would be the contingencies. What are the contingencies for the Federal Government to recoup its taxpayer dollars if California defaults on its obligations? We have some real priorities in California. And as the Central Valley continues to suffer with a drought. as our schools continue to lag behind. as our public safety dollars continue to get robbed. is this the best use of our money? And should we be investing in something that. unlike Texas and Florida. has no private investors. has no State match. has a lot of funding questions that need to be answered before we move forward?
1130070101,Well. certainly. we are falling way behind the rest of the world. Other technologies are starting to flourish in other parts of the world. yet here this project will take at least 30 years but. more likely. 50 to 60 based on where they are currently standing on the project. So this is something that will be far outdated technology if it ever gets completed. But the real question is on the funding. Where is the commitment? This President certainly could look for or come up with other money. He could propose other money to fulfill this project. Not even Democrats will support that. That is not a Republican issue. This is an issue across the Nation saying. why would we come up with money. when we are starved across the Nation. to throw at a project in California that is being mismanaged? I think that there are real questions there not only for the administration but private investors that are not willing to sink money into a failing project. They dont know what they are on the hook for. They dont know how long of a commute this will be or what the ridership numbers will ever be. Even by this entire plan. there are too many stops. Whether you talk to the Rail Authority or whether you talk to investors around the world. with that many stops in those locations. you will never get to the 220milesperhour speed. and you will never get to 2 hours and 40 minutes. This thing is full of holes. It makes no sense for voters. and voters should have a sayso on whether or not they are going to commit any initial money or any further money as we move forward. This is about our future. not yours and mine. but our kids. our grandkids. and the type of debt that we saddle them with. At a certain point. I think that not only Californians. but Americans. need to wake up and say whether or not this is a project that deserves an investment. Can we do things smarter? Can we do things like Florida and Texas? I dont think Florida and Texas are going to be alone. I think there will be other States that step up and find ways to do highspeed rail and find ways to make a commonsense solution in their States. But in this State. this project is flawed. It is initially flawed by $20 billion. but certainly by more than $55 billion if we decide to move forward. At a certain point. you have to ask. how much is enough? I would say that now is enough.
1130073813,Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of the bill to ensure again that the House takes the lead in taking action about this big crisis that we are having in Californias Central Valley. This measure puts a number of commonsense ideas on the table to alleviate the severity of todays drought. There is need for a Federal response. because California has a crosscutting network of both State and Federal water projects. With the passage of this bill. I hope the Senate will finally come to the table. If you dont like our idea. come up with one of your own. We have to have storage. We have to have conveyance. We need to plan for the future. There are times when we have wet years. but if we dont store the water. we dont have it for drought years. It is common sense. and it should be bipartisan and it should be bicameral. What I am most proud about on this bill is that you actually have Members from different regions of the State that have come together and said the time is now to finally come together on a solution for what we have and what we are facing today in Californias Central Valley. I am thankful to Mr. VALADAO for not only bringing this bill up. but for also including my provisions which will create some more water storage. including Los Vaqueros and Exchequer and streamlining construction projects. This bill also includes two of my bills: H.R. 2705. seeking to protect native salmon and steelhead on the Stanislaus River. and H.R. 2554. which would allow 100.000 new acrefeet of storage on New Melones reservoir. We can do simple things to conserve more water. These two measures produce more water and alleviate pressure on supplies. and at no cost to the taxpayer. Yesterday the Senate passed the farm bill. which we passed here last week. Without water. in California. having a farm bill doesnt matter a whole lot if you cant plant the crops that feed the rest of the Nation. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. The time is now to have a real water solution. Again. if you dont like this one. then come up with one of your own. Lets have some water storage. Lets actually have a dialogue. but lets not shut down residents of the Central Valley or drinking water across the State.
1130075238,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to acknowledge and honor the life of a true American hero. Robert Newton Lowry. on his 95th birthday. Bob was born on this day. February 25. 1919. 95 years ago. here in Washington. D.C. He considers Modesto. California. his home. For high school. Mr. Lowry attended Manlius School. a military school in upstate New York. He graduated at the top of his class and was named an ROTC honor grad. Bob also received a commission to the United States Army. but. unfortunately. he was too young to accept it at the time. He then was admitted to Princeton University. During his time there. he received the prestigious New York Herald Book Award. He graduated in 1942 with highest honors. summa cum laude and ROTC. These honors earned him another commission. this time to the United States Marine Corps as a second lieutenant. In July 1942. following Officer Candidate School at Quantico. he began artillery training. In February of 1943. Bob sailed out of San Diego Harbor with the 2nd Battalion. 12th Regiment of the Third Marine Division. He joined the fighting in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. first in Guadalcanal. then the original invasions of Bougainville. Guam. and Iwo Jima. During his time in Auckland. New Zealand. Bob met his wife. Lieutenant Commander Mary Dudley. They married in May of 1946. Mary died in April 2005. just 2 weeks before their 60th anniversary. Mary always maintained that. as lieutenant commander. she outranked him both in the military service and in their marriage. They are survived by two children. Robert Dudley Lowry and Ann LowryPerez. as well as four grandchildren: Sam and Joe Lowry. and Michael and Lowry Champion. After the battle of Iwo Jima. Bob returned stateside to Norfolk. Virginia. where he commanded a Marine guard company at the naval station. He was soon appointed commanding officer of the Europa. a 100man Marine detachment sent to Europe to provide security for a seized German luxury liner. Bob was one of the few Marine Corps officers to manage the commissioning of this kind of Navy vessel. Bob was released from Active Duty in January 1946 and retired from the Marines in 1959 with the rank of major. Following his time in the Marines. he enrolled in law school at the University of Virginia in a postwar accelerated program. graduating in 1948. Bob then began a lifetime of specialty law practice. primarily in public utility and transportation. His career started first with the Southern Railway and then progressed to his work at a law firm in Washington. D.C. In 1953. Bob accepted a position with Brobeck. Phleger & Harrison. a renowned law firm in San Francisco. from which he retired in 1989. He has greatly enjoyed the company of the Marine Corps League. the Modesto Detachment. whose members regularly go out of their way to include him. to celebrate his service. as well as they are doing his 95th birthday celebration. Mr. Speaker. please join me in honoring Robert Newton Lowry on his unwavering dedication and contributions to this great Nation.
1130097978,"Mr. Chairman. this is a very simple amendment. Again. it reads: ""None of the funds made available by this Act may be used for highspeed rail in the State of California or for the California HighSpeed Rail Authority."" As chair of the Subcommittee on Railroads. Pipelines. and Hazardous Materials. I am a big supporter of highspeed rail. I have seen some of the greatest highspeed rail in other countries. and here. even in the United States. we are going to see the first highspeed rail in Texas and then in Floridatwo projects that are moving forward with private dollars. Yet. in California. in 2008. we passed Proposition 1A. which was a guarantee to the voters that a $33 billion project would not only be built but would be built on time. with equal parts of funding from the State voters. from the Federal Government. hopefully. and then from the private investors. Today. 5 years later. after $3.8 billion in stimulus funds for shovelready projects were dedicated to this. still not one shovel is in the ground. It is a project that has been held up in court. The $9.95 billion cannot be used. and there are no private investors. So the question is: Why should the Federal Government be putting more money into a project that is nonexistent today? It is a project that. even by its own definition. is $32 billion short. not in the project. but in the initial operating segment. which is guaranteed to the voters to be completed. This is a project that has grown out of control. When they found out that they were in default in April. rather than fixing the problem. they committed to next years budget. utilizing $250 million in capandtrade funding. There is a reason the judges have struck this down to this point. and there is a reason that voters wanted to have this go back before them: it is a project that has no end in sight. Again. no shovels have been put into the ground even though the Federal Government has obligated $3.8 billionmoney that could be used for other priorities. Today. we are in a situation. With a $32 billion shortfall. there is no proposal from the President to fill that gap. and there is no proposal from the Governor to fill that gap. Yet there is the hope that the Federal Government will continue to find new money to throw at something that is nonexistent. This doesnt meet the Prop 1A guarantee. There is no State match. and the cost has more than doubled. Again. the jobs that have continued to be talked about for the last 5 years are nonexistent. Mr. Chairman. I would urge an ""aye"" vote on this amendment. We have got to stop this train wreck. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130117025,Mr. Speaker. as we continue to tackle the pressing need for VA health care reform. the last thing our veterans need is even more uncertainty with the many other benefits that have an equally important impact on their lives. H.R. 5404. the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act. extends several important VA authorities that support the services they rely on every single day. As current military forces overseas draw down. our country must prepare to welcome back thousands of returning soldiers. many of whom are young and aspiring to build a new life for themselves and their loved ones. For the next year. veterans can continue to utilize programs that help them pay off school debt. for health education. and buy affordable homes. helping their transition into civilian life be an easier one. For those veterans who require more daytoday medical care. they can continue to qualify for child care assistance and specially adaptive housing grants. as well as accessing expanded health services. such as those provided by the VAs 70plus mobile vet centers around the country. Transportation services to VA medical facilities will also continue. giving peace of mind to the many disabled or ruralbased vets that too often find themselves restricted by mobility or distance. In rural districts like mine across the country. veterans often travel over 90 miles for an appointment. disrupting their lives and causing physical and financial hardship. Additionally. this bill reinforces our fight against homelessness by expanding rehabilitation. counseling. and housing programs to help these underserved veterans get back on their feet. Since 2009. veteran homelessness has dropped 23 percent. largely due to the success of these services. Whenever I travel back to my district and meet with local veteran constituents and organizations. it is clear that these grant programs are making a real difference. In Californias Central Valley. Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Stockton has received a grant from the VA that is helping preserve 791 households in San Joaquin County from the threat of homelessness. That is 791 families who have a chance to build a stable home life and keep their kids in school. As cochair of the Veterans Jobs Caucus. I place especially high importance on the continuance of our essential reintegration and job training programs. Through their service. these hardworking men and women gain the skills and qualities that are highly valued by employers. We must do all we can to connect them with the resources and training they need to land worthwhile jobs that will bring this financial security and dignity to their lives. In closing. I would just like to thank the ranking member and the chairman as well as all of the committee for their hard work in putting this bill together. This is a great bipartisan bill that will continue to help the lives of those that have given everything for the freedoms of our country.

1130003100,"Mr. Speaker. ""genderbased violence""-a phrase the world has coined to speak internationally about violence. abuse. rape. assault. and disrespect of women. Women like our mothers. grandmothers. sisters. aunts. nieces. friends. and most especially our children. Genderbased violence permeates the world. generally in far away countries. far from the civilized democratic world that we communicate with and befriend. To the women of this Congress and the women of the world. take a moment to imagine trying to survive without a response from the police. without the ability to press charges and being able to actually see your assailant day after day if you are a victim of genderbased violence. Contemplate life without access to medical care to address your physical. mental. and emotional trauma. Imagine having nowhere to hide. This scenario sounds like 100 years ago in a world far from our country. but in reality it is just a twohour flight away from my congressional district of Miami. Florida. It actually describes genderbased violence in Haiti. But through smart policy and the strength and courage of Haitian women. its a reality thats within our power to change. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti brought a striking increase in incidents of genderbased violence. Nearly half of the victims are girls under 18. and many cases involve the use of weapons. gang rape. and death threats for seeking help from authorities. These threats. coupled with the lack of police presence and equipment. hurts the integrity of Haitis legal system and denies women and girls their basic dignity. The National Penitentiary was destroyed in the earthquake. freeing countless violent prisoners who now roam the streets. Through the determination and grace of the Haitian people and smart assistance from the Obama administration and international NGOs. some change is coming to Haiti. Most of the rubble has been removed. more than a million Haitians have moved out of tent camps. jobs have been created. schools have been built. yet core challenges. including genderbased violence. remain severe. Today. I am introducing a resolution calling attention to the plight of Haitian women and children and calling for action on their behalf. With its Strategy to Prevent GenderBased Violence. the Obama administration is on the right track. Congress and the administration must ensure robust funding for these initiatives. including the U.S. Agency of International Developments Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy. to meet the continuing need. For me. this issue is personal. I have seen the tent cities firsthand. I have spoken to the women. I have counseled the victims and witnessed the scars of indignation and pain. I feel the anguish in my bones. but I also feel the hope. Lets work together to ensure that no woman in Haiti. no woman in this hemisphere or in this world. has to bear the indignity of sexual violence."
1130046313,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3092. the Missing Childrens Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2013. This bill will be named after former Congressman E. Clay Shaw. from my State of Florida. who was a defender of childrens rights and who recently passed away. Since its inception in 1984. the Missing Childrens Assistance Act has helped identify and recover millions of missing and exploited children across our Nation. Now that it is due to expire at the end of this month. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reauthorize this critical legislation that protects societys most vulnerable citizensour precious children. We have made progress. We now have the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the AMBER Alert. but we still have so much work to do. There are still too many tragic cases of children being abducted. raped. sexually abused. and murdered. As a parent. a grandparent. an elementary schoolteacher. and a school principal. I was deeply shaken when a beautiful 4yearold girl. who was in the custody of the foster care system. went missing in my own community. She was missing for 2 years before anyone even knew it. She has never been found. Rilya Wilsons disappearance exposed many of the shortcomings of the Department of Children and Families in my home State of Florida. One of the most troubling aspects of Rilyas case was the fact that Rilya had been withdrawn from preschool. No one gave the foster parent permission to withdraw her. If she were still in school. there would have been so many eyes watchingteachers. parents. and her peers. If she were still in school. somebody would have known that she was missing. If this bill were in place. Rilya would have been saved by sensible procedures. H.R. 3092 adds commonsense coordination and oversight provisions that will facilitate the protection of foster youth like Rilya. First. the bill updates the law that provides Federal support for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The center. which heads national efforts to locate and return missing children to their families. helps to stop the kidnapping and sexual exploitation of young people nationwide. They staff 24houraday. 7dayaweek call lines to both recover missing children and report child exploitation. Since its inception in 1984. the center has received 200.062 calls for missing children. or an average of 548 calls per day. and it has responded to over 3.7 million calls overall. Thanks to the centers call hotline. the vast majority of missing children has been recovered quickly. Second. and specific to Rilyas case. H.R. 3092 requires the national center to help law enforcement work with child welfare agencies to respond to missing foster children. Foster children continue to go missing at much higher rates than their peers. and their disappearances tend to go unreported for much longer periods of time. Under H.R. 3092. law enforcement agencies must notify the national center of each report received relating to missing children from foster care. This reauthorization also requires that Federal resources support the training and technical assistance of law enforcement to work effectively with public schools in order to identify and recover missing children. It assists law enforcement in preventing and recovering missing children with disabilities. H.R. 3092 improves the current efforts of the center to identify. locate. and recover victims of child sex trafficking. It also directs the center to raise awareness about prevention and educational services for programs that support homeless youths who are at significant and increasing risk of sexual exploitation. I am delighted to see Democrats and Republicans come together in order to stand up strong for missing and exploited children. I would like to thank Chairman KLINE and his staff for their efforts in working with Ranking Member MILLER and his staff. I would like to thank the nonprofit advocates and the bipartisan Senate staff for developing this legislation to reauthorize the Missing Childrens Assistance Act. For me. this is personal. It is about a little girl named Rilya Wilson. a foster child born to a drug addicted mother. Its about Rilyas legacy and the legacy of so many foster children who suffer. For all of us. this should be a simple and sensible way to honor our children and protect societys most vulnerable citizens. This is a great day in the House of Representatives. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130048951,"Mr. Speaker. this is my own little ""nonfilibuster"" in the House of Representatives. I simply cannot stay quiet when a crowning achievement for the American people is under attack. The term ""ObamaCare"" was coined by Republicans in 2010 to mock the Affordable Care Act. Well. this is one place where I agree with the Republicans. I believe that ObamaCare is the perfect name for the Affordable Care Act because the Affordable Care Act is proof that Obama cares. He cares about Americas families. He cares about mothers. He cares about fathers. He cares about young people. He cares about babies. He cares about seniors. He cares about the future of the American people. Yes. Obama cares. We know that Obama cares because insurance companies can no longer deny 17 million children with preexisting conditions health coverage. We know that Obama cares because 105 million Americans with lifethreatening diseases no longer have to live in fear of maxing out on their lifetime dollar limits on their insurance coverage. We know that Obama cares because more than 3 million young people up to age 26 can now have coverage because insurance companies can no longer remove them from their parents plans. Mr. Speaker. I do not want to say that the people in Congress who oppose ObamaCare do not care. but I need help in understanding this dilemma. Where do they live? Who do they represent? Who could oppose health care for their constituents? The opponents of ObamaCare have not proposed a single serious alternative to provide health care coverage. Their constituents get sick. too. Have these Members of Congress ever been sick? Have they ever had a sick family member without insurance coverage? Have they ever been to a public emergency room? They should be afraid for their neighbors. their friends and family who may someday become jobless. uninsured. and sick. They will lose everything that they own. Who do these people represent? Do they represent robots? Do they feel? Do they bleed? Do they have pain? Members of Congress should be encouraging people to get coverage and expand access to health care. We can stop the crisis of uninsurance that is killing people. draining our tax dollars. and degrading our health system. Instead. too many legislators are spreading myths and halftruths about the only plausible plan that exists right now to end our health care crisis. ObamaCare is not a government takeover. To the contrary. it is an improvement on our private. free marketoriented health care system. You will have choices. You will have access. If you are unemployed with no health care. you will likely get it. If you are employed with health care. you will likely experience no change in your present health care coverage. If you are on Medicare. do not be frightened. You will experience no changes in your Medicare coverage. The Federal Government is simply making it easier and cheaper for people who have no insurance to get insured. The Federal Government will subsidize your health care bills according to your income status. ObamaCare is trying to ensure that no ones livelihood is destroyed by a serious illness. When I was an elementary school principal. I worked to help a homeless family whose children were attending my school. The father was a professional manan opticianwhose lifetime was destroyed when he hit his lifetime cap for health care coverage because of serious medical conditions related to sickle cell anemia. They suffered. They lost everythingtheir home. their dignity. their health. The whole school joined in to help them through this crisis. This family was forced to work incredibly hard to survive. They would not have had to face such a hardship if the Affordable Care Act protections were in place. We know that ObamaCare is about women because pregnancy can no longer be considered a preexisting condition. We know that ObamaCare is about young people because young peoplethe likeliest to be involved in auto crashes or motorcycle crashes or drug usewill be insured. They are not invincible. as they so often believe. As it stands now. someone has to pick up the tab when they make a mistake. They need to be insured. Have you been to a public emergency room lately? Its a nightmare. People everywhere are suffering. waiting endlessly for their turn. So many of these patients are not insured and cannot pay. Not only do they suffer. but the taxpayers and public health system also suffer. The costs are passed on down the line. What a relief it would be for our public hospitals and for the taxpayers if we could ensure that every person in America that was eligible has health insurance. This is about fiscal responsibility. People want to be insured. They want the peace of mind and stability. ObamaCare is about the economic future of this Nation because the Affordable Care Act ensures that Americans pay for all the health care services they use. Preventive care would save so much money and save so many lives. Mr. Speaker. no one said that this would be easy. Progress is never easy. We went through this struggle with Social Security in 1935. Before Social Security. senior citizens suffered and died in poverty. Social Security provoked a tremendous backlash from conservatives. Members of Congress even fought to strip domestic workers and agricultural workers of their benefits in order to keep African Americans out of the system. We had to fight. but we ultimately succeeded in building a Social Security system that keeps tens of millions of Americans out of poverty. We have come a long way. We went through this struggle with Medicare in 1965. Back then. Republicans. including thenCalifornia Governor Ronald Reagan. declared that Medicare was a ""Sovietstyle health model"" and the end of freedom in America. But we ultimately succeeded in building a health care system for the elderly that prevents untold suffering and death. ObamaCare is about 30 million lives. October 1. 2013. Its about marching forward in the proud tradition of Social Security and Medicare. Its about marching toward the goal of a society that truly cherishes human life. Nobody said that it would be easy. We knew it would be difficult. We knew it would be hard. Weve been here before. We fought hardand we won. And were on our way to another crowning achievement in the history of this Nation. simply because Barack Hussein Obama cares. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130049378,"Thank you for sharing this hour with me. Representative GARAMENDI from California. my dear friend. Mr. Speaker. who could be against making every American eligible for health care insurance? I cant even imagine. So Im here today to help set the record straight about ObamaCare. Im here to explain what ObamaCare means to the people in my community and the people around this Nation. And Im here to explain the truththe real truthbehind the health care reforms that are moving ahead on Tuesday. October 1. simply because Obama cares. Mr. Speaker. this health reform is about making it easier and cheaper to get insurance if you dont have it. Its that simple. Our President. Barack Obama. cares and is making health care easier to obtain. He cares and is making health care more affordable. President Barack Obama cares and is making health care more accessible. Now. listen up: if you have Medicare. this does not apply to you. This has absolutely nothing to do with you. It will not affect your coverage. If you have Medicaid. this does not apply to you. If you have a job with health care coverage. this does not apply to you. ObamaCare only applies if you do not currently have insurance. You will finally have the opportunity to gain protection for your body. You will finally find peace of mind. You no longer have to live in fear of being bankrupted by a health emergency. You no longer will have to let your health suffer by avoiding the doctor. You no longer will have to fear for your family going without care. Mr. Speaker. there are very simple steps for getting started if youre insured. Because Obama cares. you can get started with these simple directions. If you have access to the Internet. you can get started right away. Beginning Tuesday. October 1. Healthcare.gov will give you all the information you need to sign up for this program. Once youre there. go to the tab that says ""get insurance."" Mr. Speaker. this will take you to a page that will explain all the insurance marketplaces available to you. You will be able to compare all the plans available to you in your area. Mr. Speaker. the Internet is the best way to sign up. but if youre not comfortable using a computer. ask a friend. or ask a young relative to help you survey the choices. Young people know all about computers. If you need additional help. you can also call 18003182596. People are available around the clock to offer assistance in more than 150 languagesand in Miami. that is very important. They can help you enroll by mail if you prefer. Mr. Speaker. Obama cares so much that there will also be expert advisers called ""navigators"" in your community. You can find them at community health centers. at the mall. in drugstores. and in many places of worship. In some States. traditional insurance agents and brokers will be able to help. But remember this: if someone tries to charge you money for advice on how to sign up. say ""no"" because it is a scam. No one should be charged for assistance in signing up. Mr. Speaker. Americans should take their time in completing the important task of choosing the right health insurance plan. I know sometimes it can take 2 hours to choose the right pair of shoes at the mall or 2 hours at the kitchen table to choose the right cable TV plan. Be patient. Take your time in choosing the right plan to protect your body and your life. You wont regret it. Mr. Speaker. Obama cares because health reform is not only about making insurance simple. but also making it affordable. Let me just give you a couple of examples: A selfemployed person with a spouse and two children and a household income of $33.000 would more than likely not be able to afford insurance at all today. but starting Tuesday. October 1. this person would be able to get insurance for his entire family for an average of $94 per month because of a government subsidy. A single mother with three children and a household income of $40.000 will now be able to insure herself and her children for an average of $163 per month through ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker. its affordable and its essential to be covered. Young people under 26 will be able to stay on their parents plans. For those young people without the opportunity to join their parents plans. its especially important for you to get insurance. If youre young. youre statistically more likely to end up in a car crash or a motorcycle crash or to experiment with drugs or other risky behavior that lands you into trouble. You need insurance as much or more than anyone else. You have to pay to insure that car. you have to pay to insure that motorcycle. so make sure that you pay a very small portion of that first paycheck you earn to insure your precious body. Mr. Speaker. no one said this would be easy. There will be challenges as the Federal Government implements the new insurance markets in 36 States in the weeks ahead. But progress is never easy. Nothing this important and ambitious is easy. There will be needed tweaking and needed corrections. But that was also the case in 1935 when we rolled out Social Security and in 1965 when we rolled out Medicare. Mr. Speaker. we know that Obama cares because insurance companies can no longer deny 17 million children with preexisting conditions their health coverage. We know that Obama cares because 105 million Americans with life- threatening diseases like cancer no longer have to live in fear of maxing out on their lifetime dollar limits on their insurance coverage. We know that Obama cares because more than 3 million young people up to the age of 26 now have coverage because insurance companies can no longer remove them from their parents plans. Yes. Mr. Speaker. we are well on our way to a healthier. more financially secure Nation. We refuse. we utterly refuse. to allow anyone to damage. repeal. or turn back ObamaCare. It is the law of the land and it is here to stay. We will stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. We will speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves. We will do all this and more because President Barack Hussein Obama cares. He cares for the people of this Nation."
1130054249,Mr. Speaker. it has been more than 1.000 days since I arrived in Congress. and Republican leaders have still not allowed a single vote on serious legislation to address our jobs crisis. Instead. this House has voted 46 times to defund or delay health care for people who desperately need it. wasting precious time. Wake up. Republicans. ObamaCare is not only the law of the land. it is not only a safeguard to save the millions of people with preexisting conditions. it is an essential tool to give people the economic security and purchasing power they need to revive our economy. People need ObamaCare. President Obama cares about the American people. and we should. too. Even a Tea Party member of my freshman class of 2010 understood this when he stood and expressed his hopes of being able to receive federally subsidized health coverage immediately upon taking office. He was incensed. He couldnt wait 30 days. but he acts as if he wants his constituents to wait forever. People all over the world are amazed that we do not have universal health care like they do. We are a world power. and they are saying. You dont have universal health care in America? Mr. Speaker. people want health care. people deserve health care. and. Mr. Speaker. people want jobs. No one wants to revive the Great Recession by playing dangerous games with our economy. But do you know what? That is precisely what this House is doing. This is scary. I am nervous. I am stunned by the insensitivity. The whole world economy rests on Americas Treasury bonds. Let me repeat: The whole world economy rests on Americas Treasury bonds. Mr. Speaker. when we play with fire on the debt ceiling. you threaten to burn down the buttress on which Americans 401(k)s. mutual funds. small businesses. and stock portfolios rest. Just consider what happened the last time Republicans simply threatened to breach the debt ceiling in 2011. Government bonds were downgraded. retirement assets plummeted. and homeowners saw big hikes in their monthly payments. That was just for talking about breaching the debt ceiling. Independent analysts have concluded that a debt default would be as bad as the global financial crisis of 2008. After that crisis. American savers lost decades worth of wealth in their homes and 401(k)s. We are still living with massive unemployment from that crisis to this date. While some Members of Congress may like to behave as though we have moved past our unemployment crisis. it is a different story when you look at African Americans13 percent unemployment. the Hispanic community. 9.3 percent unemployment. and the youngest workers. 22 percent unemployment. Across America there are nearly 12 million people officially out of work and tens of millions more who are underemployed or who have simply given up looking. Americas public sector workersour teachers. firefighters. construction workers. public health workers. medical researchers. public defenders. bus drivers. social workers. and policehave already suffered so painfully. first under the sequester. and now under the shutdown. But a default would devastate every worker and every retiree. It would hit every 401(k). every mutual fund. every stock portfolio. every mortgage payment. every student loan. and every business loan. It is impossible to be fiscally conservatively or probusiness and simultaneously try to use this financial weapon of mass destruction against American businesses and American taxpayers. It is time for Congress to pass a clean debt ceiling bill. Mr. Speaker. open the government. Mr. Speaker. raise the debt ceiling. Mr. Speaker. lets begin to address our real crisis: jobs. jobs. jobs.
1130092955,"Thank you. Congressman ENGEL. I would like to thank the leadership of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the original cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation. Congressman ENGEL. Congressman ROYCE. Congresswoman RoSLEHTINEN. Congressman SMITH. Congresswoman BASS. and the support of Leader PELOSI. I stand here today on the House floor demanding that we ""bring back our girls."" I am outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of hundreds of female students in Nigeria by the terrorist group Boko Haram. These girls have now been away from their home for more than a month. I cannot even begin to imagine what this is like for these girls. for their mothers. their fathers. their brothers. their entire village. We must end this nightmare. The abduction of these girls was committed to keep them from getting an education. The girls knew the dangers they might encounter. Their school had previously been closed due to terrorist attacks. but they went to school anyway. They went because they were determined to get an education. determined to build a better life for themselves and for their families. Women and girls have the right to go to school without fear of violence and unjust treatment. I believe that we must do everything in our power. Mr. Speaker. to ensure the safe return of these precious young girls. That is why I introduced H. Res. 573. to send a clear message to Nigeria and to the international community: women around the world have the right to be free and live without fear. Women should not be forced to risk their lives to get an education they want and deserve. H. Res. 573 puts the U.S. House of Representatives firmly on record condemning the atrocious attack and Boko Harams violent attacks on civilian targets in Nigeria. H. Res. 573 seeks to hold those who conduct violent attacks accountable. H. Res. 573 reaffirms our support for the assistance that the President and the administration is providing to help Nigerians find the girls and calls for the development of a comprehensive strategy to counter the threat of radical terrorist groups like Boko Haram. H. Res. 573 calls for the safe return of these girls to an environment that protects children seeking to obtain an education. In these girls. I see our daughters. our sisters. our nieces. I see their hopes and their dreams. These girls are strong. determined. courageous. and understand the value of an education. As a past principal. I understand. and we must support them. We know that girls who are educated make higher wages. lead healthier lives. and have healthier families. Education is truly a girls best chance for a brighter future. not just for herself. but for her family and her nation. I have a large constituency of Nigerians in my district. On Saturday. I participated in a rally to encourage Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to do more to find the girls. My constituents were calling him ""Badluck Jonathan"" in their frustration because he is not doing enough to find these girls. ""Badluck Jonathan is not doing enough"" was the call and the rallying cry at the rally. I walked away from the rally with this shirt that reads. ""Nigeria."" and I walked away with my heart still full of worry. still full of concern. and I am puzzled. Are they hungry? Are they sheltered? Can they shower? Can they take care of their womanly needs? Have they been raped? Have they been beaten? Have they been sold? Are they still even alive? God of our weary years. God of our silent tears. We are reliving the past. The past of the slave trade. The past of the torture and suffering that we endured as slaves. We should never. never relive the indignities of the past."
1130114598,Thank you. Representative HORSFORD. and to all the Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. who are here tonight to contribute to this conversation regarding an issue that is oh so prevalent in our communities and has been there for generations. I just want to say to the President of the United States that I am extremely grateful for his vision in creating an initiative called My Brothers Keeper. My Brothers Keeper hopefully will address some of the issues that our young boys of color face. I want to say that there is so much friction between police and black boys. That friction has been there for generations. almost since slavery. And it is a conversation that black parents have to have with their young boys as soon as they probably get a drivers license. They have to talk to them about dealing with the police. And I want to say. in my hometown of MiamiDade County. I founded a program called the 5000 Role Models of Excellence 22 years ago. We must realize that everyone just doesnt have a parent. they just dont have a responsible parent that can have that conversation with them. So we recruit mentors across this Nation to deal with these young men and try to teach them how to deal with some of the issues that impact especially boys of color but more specifically when it comes to the police black boys. The pamphlet starts out by saying if the police stop you. freeze. dont move. unless you are told to do so. Never run from the police. Always remain calm. Think. cooperate. speak clearly. ask questions if you have to. and it goes on and on. It is sad that we have to do this. We are not trying to break the spirits of young black boys. but we are trying to keep them alive. This is how the pamphlet looks. And it was really orchestrated by our State attorney. our public defender. and the MiamiDade County Association of Chiefs of Police. And they put it together and put it in all of the schools for all of the children and members of the schools police to teach these children how to respond if the police ever stop them. I have a real concern with Michael Browns case. and that concern is with the State attorney. I really have a real concern that the grand jury may not get all of the evidence that they need. My father served on the grand jury for many years. I do know that the State attorney has so much sway over the grand jury. My heart broke even worse than it did when he was killed. when we realized that the State attorney would be the one that would send the case to the grand jury that would oversee the case. He had a history that no one wants to have. His father was a police officer. and he was killed by a Black youth. If that is not enough to recuse yourself from the case in general. to my colleagues. I cannot understand what else could be the case. You remember Trayvon Martin. who came from my district. He was killed. The first thing that happened was the State attorney didnt want to recuse himself. but the Governor removed him. so I am really counting on Governor Nixon tonight to remove the State attorney. to remove the prosecutor from this case because. otherwise. Michael Brown may not get a fair trial. and he deserves justice under the law. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I will continue to pray for his family because this is not a good time in America for young Black boys. They are watching. They are paying attention to this case. People all across the world are watching what is going to happen in Ferguson. I am afraid of what will happen if the verdict or if the police. Wilson. is not even indicted.
1130124351,Mr. Speaker. I thank Congressman WELCH for yielding me time as well as Chairman ISSA and Ranking Member CUMMINGS for their support in bringing this bill to the floor. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4030. a bill to designate the post office at 18640 NW 2nd Avenue in Miami Gardens. Florida. as the Father Richard MarquessBarry Post Office Building. The Reverend Canon Richard Livingston MarquessBarry was born on November 14. 1940. in Miami. Florida. to Bahamian immigrants. Raised by his grandparents. Reverend Barry attended the MiamiDade County Public Schools system while working as a garbage collector every morning before school and as a dishwasher after school. Reverend Barry earned his Bachelor of Arts at St. Augustine College in Raleigh. North Carolina. in 1962. That same year. he married Virla Rolle. his college sweetheart. The couple has been married for 52 years and has one daughter and two grandsons. Reverend Barrys lifelong devotion to the church began in 1965 when he became the only person of color enrolled at the Virginia Theological Seminary. Three years later. he earned a masters in divinity. and in 1989. he was the youngest person to earn a doctor of divinity degree in the 200year history of the Virginia Theological Seminary. He has been a visiting fellow at the University of Munich in Germany as well as at Oxford University in England. In 1977. Reverend Barry took a pay cut in order to lead the Saint Agnes Episcopal Church. the largest and oldest Episcopal congregation for people of color in south Florida. Not only did he transform Saint Agnes and leave it with an endowment upon his retirement. he also worked tirelessly to improve the Overtown community where Saint Agnes is located. As a young priest. Reverend Barry served his community religiously and also dedicated himself to furthering civil rights despite numerous assassination attempts. He led the effort to integrate the St. Lucie County public school system. He also pressured the city of Fort Pierce and St. Lucie County to adopt fair hiring and promotion practices within the police and fire departments and within all other government agencies. He has also been a champion of improving housing options for underprivileged people in our community. Among his many awards. Reverend Barry is currently the holder of two keys to MiamiDade County and of one key to the city of Miami for his many years of devotion and advocacy to the south Florida community. He has been recognized for his work by Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. the NAACP. the Florida State Senate. and President Obama. Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank Reverend Barry for his decades of service to our community. and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to designate the Miami post office the Father Richard MarquessBarry Post Office Building.

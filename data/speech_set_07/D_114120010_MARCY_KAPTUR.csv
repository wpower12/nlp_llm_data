1140009798,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Drinking Water Protection Act. to arm communities against the threats posed by toxic algae. The water emergency across the Toledo region for three days last August highlighted the need for a more robust federal response to harmful algal blooms in our Great Lakes and around the country. Nearly half a million people. businesses. and hospitals were without fresh water from the citys system. First and foremost. Northern Ohiowhich draws its sustenance from Lake Eriehas to guarantee our water is safe to drink. Our communities must be informed and prepared to respond. in the event of another emergency. This bill is an important step in the right direction. It is my hope that it expedites work at the U.S. EPA to publish longoverdue guidelines on safe consumption limits and testing protocols. in addition to treatment methodsinformation the EPA has been working on for more than a decade and a half. This is information that our mayors. our governor. and our citizens are clamoring for. Congress needs to pass this bill. and I hope our counterparts in the Senate will take up the measure quickly. Still. this bill only addresses one facet of the challenge. We must meet the larger challenge of stopping the growth of these blooms at their sourcethe nutrients flooding through our rivers. into Lake Erie. That imperative is not included in this particular bill. but we are working through programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to install conservation projects across our watershed. Congress should overturn the illadvised proposed cuts to the GLRI program and fully fund it. The EPA and Corps of Engineers are also working to better protect our waterways through the Clean Water Act. If we are interested in protecting our Lakes and rivers and the communities that rely on them. Congress should stop opposing this important progress. Until the flow of algaefeeding nutrients into the lake is stopped. the risk of further water emergencies will persist. I urge my colleagues to join me in this broader effort. and that starts by supporting the bill before us today.
1140010118,"Mr. Speaker. I stand here this morning as a member of the Appropriations Committee and its Subcommittee on Homeland Security. Our subcommittee is responsible for setting and overseeing funding for the operations of the Department of Homeland Security. In 2 days. on February 27. astoundingly. funding for the Department of Homeland Security runs out because the Republican majority cant agree on a bill due to their internal disagreements on the immigration provisions which are contained in the same bill because it is in the same Department. Although a clean funding bill. H.R. 861. could quickly be brought to this House floor for a vote to fund the entire Department for the remainder of this fiscal year. Republicans have defaulted to the rightwing extremists in their own party and instead have chosen to hold the security of our Nation hostage in order to contort the legislative process. They would defund the Presidents immigration executive order merely because they want a partisan win more than they want to govern. What a tragedy. To quote an editorial from yesterdays Washington Post: ""The fervor of Republican partisanship. especially in the House. is immune to logic beyond an insistence on victory at any cost."" This is a Republican Party that just a year and a half ago shut our Nations government down for 16 days. stopping critical services and doing significant harm to the U.S. economy. then. too. they seemed more interested in a political win than responsible governance. Recall. their party also had the opportunity last Congress to bring a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill to the floor for a vote but declined to act. They have chosen not to address a concern that an overwhelming number of Americans believe needs to be resolved. There are grave consequences for forcing the Department of Homeland Security into a shutdown. The Republican Congress would cripple the Federal Emergency Management Agencys preparations for future disasters as more than a fifth of personnel are furloughed. The Republican Congress would end the Federal Emergency Management Agencys training activities with local law enforcement for weapons of mass destruction. The Republican Congress would cut off pay to thousands of Department of Homeland Security employees who are personally tasked with protecting our homeland. The Republican Congress would stop research and development work on countermeasures to protect us against devastating biological threats. on nuclear detection equipment. and on cargo and passenger screening technologies. The Republican Congress would shutter the Department of Homeland Securitys Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. meaning there will be no alerts or coordination efforts with local law enforcement agencies if a nuclear event occurs. This is so utterly irresponsible. In an era of amplified global threats. brutal terrorist attacks throughout Europe. and escalating tension throughout the Middle East. to cut off funding for the Department tasked with ensuring our homeland security is safe and secure is truly dangerous. This sort of behavior throws sand into the gears of a great society. of a great country. the oldest Republic on the face of the Earth. The American people surely are looking for reassurance that their government will offer them the security and dependability they expect. We have a responsibility to protect their security. even if it means we no longer can indulge in political brinksmanship. Mr. Speaker. we have a working bipartisan majority here in this House that holds the power to govern this Nation. All it needs is the will. Lets bring the clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill to the floor today. Lets stop playing political games with the safety and security of the American people. We owe it to them to govern and to do the job we were elected to do."
1140022383,I appreciate the chairmans yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to this amendment. I first want to invite the gentleman from Alabama to Ohio to see part of the new energy sector in our country. It is absolutely incredible. and it does involve highlevel research to produce new energy technologies. I support nuclear. and I support fossilbased research. but I also support coal and tidal energy and wind and biofuels and geothermalall of thembecause we need them. New investment in clean energy in our country in 2013 totaled $36.7 billion. The leading company in solar in our country and. frankly. globally is a U.S.-born companyborn in Ohiocalled First Solar. You mentioned nonproductivity. Their stock is sold on Wall Street. They benefited early on in that companys life by photovoltaic research beginning back in the 1970s and 1980s at the U.S. Department of Energy. It is really incredible to see the future being born. and I am hoping Alabama can take advantage of that kind of technology. What concerns me. and one of the reasons I am on my feet at this point. is that they have competition from China. The first and second companies in the world that are being subsidized by the Chinese Government are in tough competition with the U.S.-born company. and we cant ignore the fact that global venture capital and private equity in new investment in clean energy increased from $1.4 billion in 2004 to $4.4 billion in 2013. The question is: Where is that going to be investedin our country or someplace else? So I would just say that we have made tremendous progress in an alloftheabove strategy. Renewable sources now account for 23 percent of all electricity generation globally. That is amazing progress. We are learning how to work in conjunction with the Earth. Who would ever have guessed that ethanol would now consume 10 percent of what you put in your tank? People said you cant even get to 1 percent. Now they are looking to 15 percent. It is unbelievable what is happening in these fields. I appreciate the gentleman wanting to be responsible. I think we are being responsible in providing an alloftheabove bill. including new energy technologies that will help our country in future generations so we no longer have to be dependent on imported energy. which I view as our chief strategic vulnerability. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong opposition to the gentlemans amendment.
1140023119,"Madam Chair. I oppose the gentlemans amendment. given it is a solution in search of a problem. Since their implementation. standards for ceiling fans and ceiling fan light kits have saved American consumersare you ready?-$4.5 billionbillionin energy costs. and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 22 metric tons. Nearly a decade agowhy do we have this system? Because three StatesCalifornia. Maryland. and New Yorkcreated their own unique standards for ceiling fan test procedures and performance. and these varying requirements created difficulties for manufacturers marketing products across all 50 States. In response. the fan manufacturing industry asked the Federal Government for a national standard that would reduce unnecessary complexity. Since that time. the DOE. Department of Energy. has not even proposed a new rule on ceiling fans. so it is premature to react to what might be in a new rule. Even if a new rule is proposed. implementation is years away. The Departments analysis so far has shown that options exist for increasing ceiling fan efficiency that are costeffective for manufacturers and the consumers. Any upgrades will enable consumers to save money by saving energy. also moving our country closer to its lowcarbon future. Given the proposed rule has yet to be released. industry cannot anticipate how much their manufacturing costs might increase. whether their business model would be turned upside down. or whether the rule would result in energy growth. Industry has not substantiated any of their claims. The Department of Energy has conducted extensive consultation with industry stakeholders. including the companies themselves. and any potential indirect effects on airconditioning units. The amendment ensures that consumers will be stuck with less efficient fans and higher energy costs. I cant see why we would want to do that. Lets help this industry. As I have stated. I object to the amendment as proposed and urge a ""no"" vote by my colleagues. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania ."
1140048356,"I would like to turn to a different subject. if I might. in the remaining time. Mr. Speaker. several weeks ago. there was a Special Order that was given on Speaker Jim Wright. and I was unable. because of duties in Ohio. to join my remarks to those of his friends and colleagues here in the Congress. I rise tonight to honor him for the leader and master of the legislative process that Speaker Jim Wright of Fort Worth. Texas. was. He approached life with an eager and courageous mission and a true democratic heart. He loved this House. He just loved it. He just basked in its glory and its power. and he had the keenness of intellect. the balance of knowledge. the intuition. the direction. and the wisdom that comes from the long years of experience that he had at the level of Fort Worth and then the State of Texas and then. obviously. federally. He was a veteran of World War II and had been a pilot and received the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was trulytrulya courageous hero for our country and chose to serve then in elected life. What I will forever remember of him was his dignity and his strength. His personal ability to also forgive those who sought to harm him and move on was an amazing trait. and I think it revealed some of what he was able to bring as a negotiator and a statesman to the work here. He was a passionate fighter for the people of our country. especially those of ordinary means who might not have their voices heard. and when he got into a topic that he loved. he was absolutely unstoppable. He was a gifted orator. He spoke with all of his heart. and he elevated this House and the people who served in it. He loved Congress. He referred to it as a heady place to be. where Members of both political parties should cooperate to make America a world leader and to build and support a strong middle class. His early life growing up during the Great Depression had a permanent imprint on him. and he never forgot the common person. His service in the Army during World War II instilled in him a life of service and a dedication to help those less fortunate. but also a passion for liberty. His legislative achievements were legion. He helped create the Clean Water Act and the Interstate Highway System. and he helped guarantee benefits for returning veterans. I remember what a master he was. I believe he chaired the House Public Works Committee and rose from there. I can still see him making the case. right at this podium here in the House. for a modern transportation bill. clinking dimes in a large glass bowl to say that we have to pay our way forward here. He understood what it took to build and maintain a great nations prosperity. He was a terrific. terrific orator. In foreign affairs. Speaker Wright had a contribution that one could describe as profound. He was a peacemaker. He visited the Middle East and facilitated the meeting that led to the accord between Israel and Egypt in More than a decade later. he led a successful push for a compromise that would end the war between the Sandinista government and the Contras in Nicaragua. Over time. his approach would lead to the end of U.S. military financing and the start of democratically held elections there. How many Americans can say they have ever been involved in something of that magnitude? In his farewell speech before Congress. Speaker Wright said: ""When vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication. harsh personal attacks on one anothers motives. one anothers character. drown out the quiet logic of serious debate on important issues. things that we ought to be involved ourselves in. surely that is unworthy of our institution. unworthy of our American political process. All of us in both parties must resolve to bring this period of mindless cannibalism to an end. There has been enough of it."" Speaker Wright returned to Fort Worth where he donated his official papers to Texas Christian Universitys library and taught a TCU course called Congress and the Presidents for more than 20 years. His intention to keep the class small was simply impossible. as his enrollment grew at an increasing rate every year. Speaker Wright always treated me graciously. Here I was from Ohio. a completely different part of the country. but I appreciate the fact that he assisted my efforts to seek a seat on the Committee on Appropriationsit took me over a decade to arrive theresince no one from our part of Ohio had ever served on it. He saw the exclusion. and he helped me. I am so grateful to him forever for that and what I have been able to do to help the country in that position. He and I shared many experiences and pursuits during our shared years in Congress. but one of my favorite memories is something we had in common. and that was a love of gardening and roses. He was especially fond of a graypurplish variety of rose that he had raised to perfection. He just loved life. Speaker Wright would often quote Horace Greeley in saying: ""Fame is a vapor. popularity an accident. riches take wings. those who cheer today may curse tomorrow. only one thing endurescharacter."" Speaker Wright was certainly a man of great character and great talent and ability and great accomplishment. We shall miss him greatly. May the hearts of his loved ones. his beloved wife. Betty. his four children. 15 grandchildren. 24 greatgrandchildren. and his sister Betty Lee Wright be warmed by the light of his memory and the legacy of liberty he bestowed upon us all and the great affection we shall always have for him in our hearts. May God bless the Wright family. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."
1140054392,"I thank you. Congressman MURPHY. for yielding to me. I want to say how fortunate the country is that the people of Pennsylvania have elected you here to serve the people of our Nation with the strong background that you have and with the obvious depths of knowledge that you have about those who are mentally ill and the compassion you have in a field that is very difficult. where the answers still remain incomplete. I want to be on the floor this evening to say to those who are listening in the Chamber. to those who may be listening outside. your efforts to draft the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. H.R. 2646. is a watershed moment in this Congress. I have served in this Congress a lot longer than the others on the floor this evening. I was here in 1998 when. sadly. we lost two of our Capitol Police officers. Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson. A diagnosed schizophrenic receiving Federal SSI benefits but off his medicines and estranged from his family headed on a rampage all across the country. all the way from the West to here. and delusionally. he set out to quash. I guess. a purple force he had tracked here to the Capitol. He broke into the majority leaders office. All the staff went under the desks. I thought. well. maybe this is the moment that Congress will finally face up to the violent impulses that have fallen right at our knees. I said. but I would wager one of two things will happen: either we will finally cut the mustard and do what is right. or we will have more barricades and armed officers. Well. it was the latter option that actually happened. As we mourn the deaths of nine innocent victims at Umpqua Community College. I commend Congressman MURPHY of Pennsylvania for putting a bill forward that forces us to probe deeply the pattern of these mass shootings. We need to know the perpetrators. We understand the perpetrator in Oregon had served in the U.S. military for a very brief time. He was discharged. And my question to the U.S. military is: Why? Why was he discharged? Did you discharge him to care if you saw a pattern that needed treatment? Or did you close your eyes too? Because that has happened repeatedly in the U.S. military. though I must say that they are doing a little bit better. because some of their own members have now been killed around the country because of individuals who face very severe illnesses in their own lives and have simply never had the kind of doctor to help them come out of the dark shadows of the existence in which they have been living. Many of these individuals have been abandoned by their families. Many times they are expelled from school. As you look around the country and you see the people who commit these heinous. heinous crimes and then many times take their own life. they are completely alone or they are living with one member of their family. abandoned by their other family members and. as the gentleman from Pennsylvania has said. many times ending up homeless. the victims of attacks themselves. or many times. out of whatever is happening in a very ill brain. taking it out on the rest of society. Probing deeply into mental illness requires a discipline that Congressman MURPHY has and an understanding that no Congress yet has had. That myopia is symptomatic of what is happening across our Nation: more security but no significant attention to those who show outofcontrol and violent tendencies. those tragically mentally ill citizens who are driven by their illness to harm others. If someone has a broken back. we have special wards. What happens to the mentally ill in the district that I represent and across this country. some of them end up in the jail. Seventyfive percent of those incarcerated in northern Ohio have dual diagnoses of mental illness and substance abuse. What does that tell us? Our jails have become the depositories for this Nations mentally ill. I am not saying that individuals diagnosed with mental illness are more likely to commit crimes. I agree with Congressman MURPHY that most of them become victims of crimes because they arent thinking straight. and it doesnt have to be this way. The bill that Congressman MURPHY has written and has vetted and has worked with different groups and individuals. and which I support and a host of other Members do on a bipartisan basis. is supported by one of the most important organizations in our country: the National Alliance on Mental Illness. I have the highest respect for them. H.R. 2646 fixes the Nations broken mental health system by refocusing programs. reforming grants. and removing Federal barriers to care. It names an assistant secretary for mental illness at the Department of Health and Human Services. and it encourages more meaningful involvement from family members and caregivers who. frankly. at this point. many times. just give up because they have this force within their homes that they cannot contain. Rather than just paying tribute to those among us who have been lost and those who save them at risk to their own lives. cannot we elevate the solution to efforts that could help to prevent further tragedies? We think about the Capitol shootings. We think about Sandy Hook. We think about Virginia Polytechnic. The U.S. leads the world in mass shootings. There have been 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone. and each one gives us an indicator of the possible sign of untreated mental illness. Each one represents a failure of our society. and dispelling the stigma of mental illness for those who suffer remains a task unfinished. When do the elected Representatives of the American people say. ""Enough. America can do better. America must do better""? Lets create a pathway. by passing H.R. 2646. to immediate treatment for those mentally ill citizens dangerous to others and dangerous to themselves. Congressman MURPHY. I cant thank you enough. I dont recall a bill which has had such broad bipartisan support. You have worked so hard to go around the country. This is not a partisan issue. this is an American issue. I hope America can lead the world in trying to find a better way. The suffering that we see in our districts. in community after community after community. broken families. broken people. this doesnt have to be in our country. In the hearing that you conducted in Cleveland. I learned something really important that I didnt know. and that is that in the way that the reimbursement occurs to hospitals for people seeking care. that research in mental illness is at the bottom of the list because reimbursement doesnt flow the same way. So as we try to find answers to what is going on in the human brain. with the secretion of such chemicals like dopamine and serotonin and these different chemicals that those who are healthy have being secreted at a normal level. those who do not have that system working for them have big problems. but yet. if doctors try to get research dollars to solve and figure out what is going on in the human brain. the reimbursement system we have today simply doesnt work. I didnt know that. So I thank you for coming to Ohio because I am focused on that like a laser beam. and it is a part of the answer. So thank you for allowing me some time tonight on the floor. The people I represent thank you. We want to help you. I hope those listening will find cosponsors from their different parts of the country to help you move this bill forward. We couldnt do anything more important for the country. Thank you."
1140058242,"Mr. Speaker. last week I came to the floor and recommended that the Obama administration appoint a special envoy with a very broad portfolio: dispatched to work on a diplomatic solution to the tragedy that is destroying Syria and unfolding in the Middle East. now having broad impact in greater Europe. I want to point out to those who are listening that the displacement crisis in the Middle East. centered in Syria. has consumed seven nations and propelled the largest refugee crisis Europe has faced since World War II. Already in Syria. over a quarter of a million people have been killedciviliansand that is probably a low number. With over 12 million people displaced. Europe is being besieged by hundreds of thousands. legions. of the dispossessed. Meanwhile. it almost seems surreal that no effective diplomatic negotiation is underway that holds the prospect of leading to peace. I again ask the Obama administration to dispatch a special envoy with a broad portfolio to work full time on a diplomatic solution to the tragedy that is destroying Syria. Then yesterday in The New York Times appeared an editorial by the legendary 39th President of the United States. Jimmy Carter. entitled ""A Plan to End the Syrian Crisis."" I served President Carter during his years in the Presidency. I well remember the incredible moment in 1979 when President Carter stood with Anwar Sadat. the President of Egypt. and the Prime Minister of Israel. Menachem Begin. and they signed that treaty in March of 1979. Who would have ever thought that that moment in history would have been possible? Yet. until today. that treaty holds between Egypt and Israel. and it has made a gigantic difference in the saving of lives in that extremely troubled region. In his editorial to The New York Times. President Carter references that the Carter Centerwhich he founded and to which he has dedicated his life with his wife Rosalyn ever since his service as Presidenthas been deeply involved in Syria since the early 1980s. Who would know more than he? He recommends the only real chance of ending the conflict is to engage the United States. Russia. Iran. Turkey. and Saudi Arabia in preparing a comprehensive peace protocol with Syria. He knows what that requires. He recommends a ceasefire. formation of a unity government. constitutional reforms. and elections. Mr. Speaker. I include for todays RECORD the editorial entitled ""A Plan to End the Syrian Crisis."" I say to my colleagues and to those who are listening: As we watch this tragedy unfold. our Nation is the most powerful nation in the world. Surely. we should have the wisdom and the will to take this latest tragedy. which we had no small part in precipitating. and find a way to bring the parties to the table. What is happening in Syria due to the lack of a diplomatic solution is now impacting Europe in ways that we have not seen since World War II. It is very destabilizing. With what is happening inside Ukraine today due to Russias invasion. with over 1.7 million displaced persons internally. if Russia would happen to turn the tourniquet tighter in eastern Ukraine and cause additional displacement across Europe. imagine what the winter months would bring. I cant urge in strong enough terms that the Obama administration pay heed to President Carters very lucid editorial in yesterdays New York Times. I commend all Members and citizens to read it. [From the New York Times. Oct. 26. 2015]"
1140083459,Mr. Speaker. I want to welcome the Congressman and doctor. DAN BENISHEK. from Michigans First District. which encompasses Marquette and Mackinac Island and Traverse City. to name a few famous towns and island. I welcome him to participate this evening as well as our other colleagues from the Great Lakes. I rise tonight to mark the occasion of World Water Day. As such. I would like to discuss the Great Lakes. an American freshwater treasure. irreplaceable on our globe. Actually. it is the largest source of freshwater in the United States and represents about 20 percent of the worlds freshwater supply. The district that I represent. which is a little south of Michigan. down in Ohio. sits nestled across Lake Eries entire south coast. extending from Cleveland all the way west to Toledo and encompasses all of Ohios ports but for one. There should be a sign. actually. on the Ohio Turnpike nearby that marks our shoreline as the stepoff point. since Lake Erie is the most southern of all the lakes. as the largest body of freshwater on the face of the Earth. I see our dear colleague. the cochair of the Great Lakes Task Force with me. Congressman MIKE KELLY of Erie. Pennsylvania. who has joined us. It is also a great port city. nestled along these Great Lakes. Let me begin by saying. since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Lake Erie itself has been on a path to recovery. It got very sick back in the 20th century. Point sources of pollution. such as inadequate wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure and industrial outfalls have been slowly coming. Since back then and the passage of the Clean Water Act and the establishment of Earth Day. they have been coming into EPA compliance. One needs no further proof in tracking the rebirth of Americas symbol. the bald eagle. than to really track Lake Eries health. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the lakes. and. therefore. it is kind of the canary in the coal mine. What happens there will happen in the other lakes subsequently. The bald eagle had actually become an endangered species by the time of the 1970s. and only two eagles were left on our great lake. Lake Erie. There were no eaglets being born. Due to the Clean Water Acts passage and literally the banning of DDT and the repair of many of the industrial outfalls. which we are still working on. and the combined sewer overflows. what happened. as we moved into the 21st century. was human progress. Today hundreds of baby eaglets are being born across Lake Erie. and they are flying other places around the country. Amazingly. the bald eagle has been taken off the endangered species list. So progress is possible. Humans can really repair the environment if they are dedicated to us. For those of us who live in Lake Eries western basin. which is the far western part of the State. the health of our lake is a living reality and access to freshwater has become the background noise of our daily lives. becoming more pronounced when tragedy strikes. as it did most recently in Flint. Michigan. and Sebring. Ohio. with lead in freshwater. [] 1645 Our region works and plays with a new normal that includes very frequent water quality reports now. updates on beach postingswhether you can swim or notwater utility fee increases. and a general concern about a troubling set of scientific questions that still go unanswered. Unfortunately. this administration has not recognized these concerns and seeks to cut Federal support to Great Lakes States by $148 million for next year. Some would call that an oxymoron. it makes no sense in view of what is happening across our region. but it is happening. This eveningand I am going to yield to my colleagues before I get into these topicsI would like to address the water infrastructure needs of the Great Lakes. harmful algal blooms. which literally shut down the city of Toledos water system a yearandahalf ago. denying fresh water for 3 days to citizens. to businesses. and to institutions in that region because of something called microcystin. which is the toxic part of certain types of algal blooms which we are trying to address. So harmful algal blooms will be one of my topics. Another topic will be the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. which is so important to all of us in helping to improve our Great Lakes. Stopping the Asian carp is another topic. The next topic will be the Great Lakes navigation system itself. an antiquated system that has to be updated for this 21st century. Finally. I will discuss the harbor maintenance fund. These are all major issues across the Great Lakes region. which we would like to place on the RECORD this evening. I would like to ask my colleagues to join me. Congressman BENISHEK. I thank you again so very much for being a leader for the Great Lakes and for coming down this evening. I now yield to the gentleman from Michigan .
1140095413,Madam Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON for his bipartisan approach in preparing this bill. I also thank Chairman HAL ROGERS and Ranking Member NITA LOWEY for their efforts throughout. To our dedicated staffDonna Shahbaz and Taunja Berquam. the Republican and Democratic clerks. as well as the rest of the committee staff: Matt Anderson. Angie Giancarlo. Loraine Heckenberg. and Perry Yatestheir countless long hours. late nights. weekends. and thoughtful insight are so critical to helping America prepare this legislation. This bill funds transformative programs that unlock Americas full economic potential. critical water resource projects. navigation and port operability. and breakthrough science advancements that are necessary for Americas strategic and competitive posture. This bill undergirds our national defense through superior weapons. naval reactor research. and nonproliferation activitiesall priorities that unite rather than divide us. Chairman SIMPSON worked hard to incorporate the interests of Members from both parties. As a result. the bills funding reflects priorities from both sides of the aisle. The chairmans efforts resulted in a bill which. with respect to funding levels. is reasonable. although. the tradeoffs are not ideal. The bill provides an increase of $259 million over the 2016 levels. It allows for stronger investments in the Army Corps of Engineers for critical projects in the Everglades and Great Lakes as well as additional funding to address flooding in areas like Houston. Notably. for the people of northern Ohio. the bill meets the need to comply with State law prior to the open lake disposal of dredged materials. The bill also provides robust funding for many areas at the Department of Energy. It is sad. however. that the majority would jeopardize this good start by adding in illsuited ideological or nongermane riders on the Clean Water Act. guns on Army Corps lands. National Ocean Policy. and the California drought. I should not have to remind our majority colleagues that similar provisions imperiled the passage of this bill in the past. In fiscal year 2016. nearly all of the Democratic Members of the House voted against this bill with far fewer poison pill riders. The administration is on record with veto threats over nearly identical language. As such. I cannot support this bill in its current form. Every year. this important bill sets the path for Americas energy future. and I am happy to note that. more than ever before. Americas course is set toward the true north of energy independence. In 2015. America produced 91 percent of the total energy consumed. This represents the 10th consecutive year of declining net energy imports. This translates into freedom. Significant strides toward Americas energy security should be applauded. but we must not lose our momentum by resting on our laurels. To finally free ourselves from our energy dependence. as well as to drastically cut dangerous carbon emissions. we must strongly support the Department of Energys efforts to embrace the future. I am disappointed by the $248 million cut. therefore. to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. which is leading the charge into the new energy economy against stiff global competition from Europe and Asia. The solar energy account. in particular. yields serious benefits. with the solar industry projected to add 9.5 gigawatts of new energy this yearmore than any other source. I am proud that my own district is active in this energy revolution. with First Solar. founded in Toledo. Ohio. the Nations current leading solar company. Wind energy is also expanding in northern Ohio. where the Great Lakes have the capacity to become the Saudi Arabia of wind. especially Lake Erie. Cleveland is poised to install the first national offshore wind turbines in a freshwater environment. and that is appropriate. given it was Cleveland where the first electric wind turbine was invented a century ago. I would like to reiterate my concerns over the controversial riders that threaten not only the ultimate enactment of this bill but also our most precious resourcewater. These provisions inclusion does a disservice in our work. particularly given the serious water challenges many parts of our country face. While I have concerns with the measure before us. I would like to express my deep appreciation for the chairmans hard work with us on so many issues. The gentleman from Idaho has ensured that the Energy and Water Development. and Related Agencies Subcommittee continues its tradition of bipartisanship. and he has been a gentleman throughout. as always. Madam Chair. I reserve the balance of my time.

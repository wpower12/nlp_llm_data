1130031067,Mr. Chairman. I bring amendment No. 7 to the consideration of the House here as we debate this very important issue. When I think about the issue thats before usI know there are a lot of good Members on both sides of it. for and against. and theres going to be a lot great debate about whether or not this bill should move forward in any fashion or another. Theres one particular portion that I really wanted to discuss today. and it deals with the incentives and the benefits that go to corn producers for the production of corn that goes to ethanol. To me. I dont believe that is something that should be provided to these producers whatsoever. these incentives or benefits. In fact. when the bill was originally crafted many years ago back in 1933. I have to ask: Did the original architects of the farm bill ever imagine that what they were creating at that time would go to benefit the producers of corn that would go to fuel and not food? So my amendment is rather simple. It just eliminates the opportunity for any producer to benefit from producing corn that would go to fuel. Instead. it focuses back on what the original intent of the legislation was. and that was to exclusively be for food production or feed production. So as we debate this bill. folks are going to be on all different sides of all these amendments. I think its really important to get back to the original intent. If youre going to support the bill. get back to the original intent of what was intended back in 1933 and the years since then. But let me just remind the House of why this is so important. Estimates tell us that more than onethird of all our corn in the United States is used for feed livestock. another 13 percent is exported. mostly for feed livestock. but another 40 percent of all corn produced in this Nation is for ethanol. And of all of that. nearly half of all corn in our Nation that is produced. those producers receive those same benefits that those that were intending to create corn for food and feed would benefit from. as well. Mr. Chairman. my amendment is rather simple. I would urge the Houses consideration of this amendment. and I reserve the balance of my time.

1130071046,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for the great work that he has done on this bill. What is so interesting and one of the reasons we find it necessary to come and address these issues is Secretary Sebelius told us in December that 5.000 people a day were getting access to health care that they had not had before. The other side of that story. which was not told. is 74.000 American families a day were getting cancelation notices. They were looking at one another across the dinner table and saying. Guess what. our insurance has been canceled. It has had a devastating effect. And as we try to do oversight and due diligence and continue to push for that oversight and due diligence and carry it out. even this morning at the Energy and Commerce Committee. where we had Mr. COHEN. what we have found is it is very difficult to get information. even when we are sometimes hearing from employees admitting what they told us was wrong. but then we do not get the straight story. So it is very appropriate that we require HHS to release weekly detailed reports about the exchanges. including their enrollment. their functionality. and efforts to address the technical issues at healthcare.gov. It is absolutely appropriate because this is all being done with the taxpayers money. The American taxpayers have paid for every bit of this. It is not the Federal Governments money. It is not President Obamas money. It is not Congress money. It is the taxpayers money. This is a failed rollout and a failed program. This administration was supposed to be the most transparent administration in history. It has not been that. It is well documented that it hasnt been. Indeed. the rollout and the implementation of this law have been even less transparent. The reason. I think. is because there have been so many problems. such as millions of Americans losing access to their health insurance. None of the information being shared by the administration regarding enrollment means much of anything. We talk about people that enrolled. but we dont know how many people have paid and how many people have completed that process. What are the demographics of the individuals that are enrolling? All of this is information that the individual that is paying for thisthe American taxpayerdeserves to know. Who has paid for this insurance? The White House has backed away from using any measure of enrollment as a means to determine success.
1130080376,Mr. Speaker. we are so excited about our talking. we didnt realize that the time had to be split. but so be it. We women stand and abide by the rules of the House. and so we will accept the acknowledgment of the change of time. I will return to directing our attention to Chief Justice Connie Clark in Tennessee. What is so important about her career is that she was first appointed to the State court by a Democrat Governor. again served under a Democrat Governor. and then chief justice under a Republican Governor. Justice Clark is such an incredible inspiration to women in our State. She has proven herself. has really been devoted to the judiciary and the law field. and is so active in our community. a tremendous role model. If we step outside of the venue of politics and law. Amy Grant. who is a singer. songwriter. a native of Nashville. has had such a successful music career. Amy Grant became the first artist in Christian music to ever have a platinum record. and she went on to become a crossover sensation in the music world. Amy Grant has pioneered the Christian music genre. and she has also blazed quite a trail in the music industry. When we look at the world of sports. another Tennesseean. from Clarksville. Tennessee. which is in my district. Wilma Rudolph. many of you will recognize her name. She was a Tennessee State University track star. On September 7. 1960. in Rome. she became the first American woman to win not one or two. but three gold medals in the Olympics. She was a trackandfield champion and was regarded as a civil rights and womens rights pioneer and is warmly remembered and treasured in our State. Pat Summitt. who was the head coach of the Lady Vols at the University of Tennessee and is now the head coach emeritus. she was at the helm of the Lady Vols for 38 seasons. She is the alltime winningest coach in NCAA historythe alltime winningest coach in all of NCAA history. That is men and womens teams. She is forthright. wellrespected. ethical. and a winner in every sense of the word. Sandra Cochran. who is the president and CEO of Cracker Barrel. Incorporated. she became the president and CEO on September 12 of 2011. following her service as Cracker Barrels president and chief operating officer. Cracker Barrel is headquartered in Lebanon. Tennessee. Ms. Cochran was previously CEO at the Nations third largest book retailer. BooksAMillion. She is serving our community and that country well. Ms. Cochran is a chemical engineering graduate from Vanderbilt University and a masters of business administration from Pacific Lutheran University. After graduating from Vanderbilt. she entered the United States Army. where she ultimately served as a captain in the 9th Infantry Division. There are so many other influential women that come from our State. and we are delighted to know that we will have the opportunity to recognize them and their contributions and the contributions of all women who have contributed to the cause of freedom in that Nation. I yield to the gentlelady from New York.
1130081514,Mr. Speaker. there is no shortage of issues here in Washington. and I find it so interesting when people come to our offices and ask: What is going on today? As you will hear. whether it is talking about foreign affairs. the job issues. the budget. the issues that are of such concern to our constituents. there is always something that is on the front burner. and today is one of those days. The Supreme Court will hear yet another legal challenge to one of the many unconstitutional aspects of ObamaCare. and that is the HHS contraception mandate. Of course. this isnt the first time that the Affordable Care Act. the Presidents health care law. has been pulled into the Supreme Court. and it is probably not going to be the last. but today the hearing is on the contraception mandate. No American should have to choose between feeding their family and abiding by their faith. I have to tell you. that is what we see happening right now. It is precisely what this coercive contraception mandate is doing to millions of hardworking people of faith. like the Hahns and the Greens. who simply want to run a business and practice their faith. These family businesses want to take care of their employees and provide them with quality health care coverage. All they ask is to not be forced to pay for the lifeending contraceptives that violate their religious convictions. Now. ObamaCares unreasonable mandate has placed them in a bind: violate the tenets of their faith or be fined. fined by the Federal Government. fined by ObamaCare. fined $100 per employee per day. That is what the fine works out to be. Unbelievably. it would be cheaper to strip their employees of health care coverage altogether and pay a single $2.000 fine per employee per year. That is what you find in the 20.000 pages of regulation. in the 2.700 pages of the Presidents health care law. That is not what these family businesses want to do. They really want to do the right thing and take care of the hardworking men and women who are in their employment. If these family businesses are forced to close or drop health care for their employees. it will be the employees and their families who are made to suffer. This mandate is just another flawed part of a terribly flawed law. and Americans are growing tired of having to cope with it. Fiftynine percent of the country opposes the contraception mandate because they know what the Greens and the Hahns know. This is a country founded on religious liberty. and that freedom of conscience is a cherished American tradition. The American people know that and they value that. they value that liberty and they value that tradition. The Obama administration has already doled out special exemptions to 100 million health care plans from this mandate. and for every reason under the sun except religious liberty. In fact. the HHS mandate only explicitly contains a religious exemption for churches and their affiliates. The Obama administration even expects hospitals and religious nonprofits to abide by the mandate without complaint. as if the very founding principles of these organizations arent outright violated by paying for lifeending contraceptives. Unless it is a religious institution. the Obama administration seems to think no organization. not even a charity. is allowed to exercise the right of conscience. unless it is granted a special waiver from the administration. of course. The administration: What the government gives. the government can delay. and the government can take away. That is their plan. It is my hope the Court will act to uphold the protections inherent in the First Amendment. respect Americas longheld tradition to right of conscience. and let these families operate their businesses in accordance with their religious beliefs and tenets.
1130084329,Madam Speaker. I am so appreciative of the opportunity for us to be able to come to the floor and have this discussion today. I think our constituents are just shocked with what they see happening because of the Presidents health care law. They cant believe it. They had heard the rhetoric from the minority leader that it was going to create 4 million jobs. What they have found out is that it is costing them their jobs. It is costing them wage increases. It is costing them certainty in the job market. I have to tell you. it really is a war on jobs. It is a war on women. and we are seeing that because women63 percent of those affected by the adverse impact of the Presidents health care law are women. Let me give you one example of this. I was in the grocery store recently. I passed a lady with two children in her grocery cart. and we chatted. nodded at each other. The next time around. the next aisle. she said: Are you MARSHA BLACKBURN? I said: Yes. I am. She asked: Can I tell you my story? I said: Absolutely. This is her story: She worked in the office park where this grocery store was located. Her husband is selfemployed. The familys benefit structure. insurance. was through her job. an employer with just over 50 people. Her hours as an office manager and assistant were cut to 29 hours a week. Her time was cut. Every week impacts her. impacts her husband. In one day. she lost her insurance. she lost her wage increases. and she was forced to healthcare.gov. Also. what she had to doshe is a survivor. She said: I went to the mall. and I went to a retailer and got a parttime job. She said: Thank goodness I have great inlaws. They are going to help watch the children. Here is what is so sad: She now is working two jobs. and she is losing time to be with those children as they are playing soccer and baseball. as they are doing Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. as they are trying to get to church to sing in the choir. She has had to rely on her inlaws to handle those. so that she can work a second job to pay for a program that she doesnt want and pay her taxes to a government that refuses to live within its means. I support the SAW Act.
1130097991,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the chairman of the committee for the diligent work that they have done to do their part to get this funding bill. this appropriations bill. to begin to bring the costs down. I think that it truly shows how dedicated many of us on this side of the aisle are to having government get its spending under control. We all know Washington does not have a revenue problem. It has an acute spending and priority problem. We see it every single day. My constituents in Tennessee see it. and they talk about it a lot. Last week. I heard a lot about the outside spending that takes place in this town. and the thing that really offends my constituents is that Congress spends. D.C. spends money that they dont have. All of it is taxpayer money. and it is so inappropriate that the spending continues to grow year by year. and the taxpayer has to pay more. Quite frankly. Mr. Chairman. I think that there is something immoral about citizens and taxpayers struggling to live within their means. so they can pay taxes to a government that refuses to live within its means. That is why. every year. I come to the floor and offer bills for 1. 2. and 5 percent acrosstheboard cuts. and then during appropriations season. I know I kind of wear a path in the carpet here. offering amendments that would cut a penny on the dollar. 1 percent across the board. and that is the nature of this amendment that I offer today. I do it because my constituents know that Washington spends too much money. that we borrow too much money and. therefore. what we are doing is capping and trading our childrens future to the people that own our debt because we couldnt be spending it if we werent borrowing it. Go talk to China. Japan. OPEC. the top holders of our debt. and they own a lot of it right now. They are the ones who will be making the decisionsprobably decisions we wont likeand at some point. they may call that bill due. Now. acrosstheboard spending cuts are not a partisan issue. In 2010. Peter Orszag. who was the Presidents pick for Director of the Office of Management and Budget. turned to the executive departments and agencies and said: I want you just to go in and cut 5 percent across the board. Governor Christie of New Jersey is well known for turning around that State. It was a 9 percent acrosstheboard cut. Governor Cuomo of New York. a 10 percent acrosstheboard cut. Governor Perry of Texas. a 10 percent acrosstheboard cut. States do it because it works. What it does is it engages the rankandfile employees who know where you can make these cuts. so I think it is time for the Federal Government to begin to do this. In our history. we have had six acrosstheboard cuts. They have ranged from 0.22 percent to 1 percent of covered appropriations. At those times. it saved us from $1.1 billion to $8.5 billion. For this bill. we need to be doing the same thing. and yes. we are below the funding levels. to the credit of the appropriators who have worked on this. We are below the 2014 funding levels. That is a good thing. but we need to do a little bit more because we are borrowing way too much. It is time to get our spending under control. I encourage my colleagues to support the 1 percent acrosstheboard spending reduction to this bill. and lets take one more step to bring this spending problem under control and move to a balanced budget. With that. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130107016,"Mr. Chairman. I rise to offer an amendment that would prevent the Federal Government from bailing out public pensioners in cities such as Detroit and Chicago. We have been reading for the past several months that the Obama administration has been in talks with the city of Detroit to transfer $100 million to the city. According to an April 16. 2014. article from the Detroit Free Press. the administration has looked to transfer $100 million from the Hardest Hit Fund to shore up Detroits unfunded pension liability. The Hardest Hit Fund was created by the Obama administration in 2010 with money from the 2008 stimulus package. The money is meant to help States that have been adversely affected by the housing downturn. and that is according. again. to the Detroit Free Press. The article adds that: The $100 million in Federal money was discussed Tuesday night in breakneck negotiations that resulted in a tentative deal to reduce pension cuts for the citys retired general workforce. Mr. Chairman. I refuse to let Federal taxpayers be on the hook for unfunded pension liabilities made by Big Labor organizations. Cities such as Detroit. Chicago. and others where Big Labor has created extremely generous retirement benefits for public service workers are going to have to find their way out of the mess that they have created. Now. it is my understanding that the city of Detroit has reached an agreement with the State of Michigan to shore up Detroits unfunded pension liability for the time being. However. it does not foreclose this as a possibility to occur in the future for Detroit or any other city where Big Labor agreements have caused financial destruction. According to an April 7. 2014. article from chicagobusiness.com. Chicagos unfunded pension liability stands at $19.5 billion. A February 20. 2013. article in Forbes notes that Federal bailouts of State pension funds ""would implicitly encourage States to keep spending and doling out entitlements. as doing so is popular for politicians. even if unsustainable."" The article adds that this is especially true in liberalleaning areas where publicsector labor unions have a lot of control. Mr. Chairman. we must foreclose the administrations bailout of Big Labor as a possibility. I refuse to stand by and watch hardworking taxpayers be on the hook for the irresponsible decisions of liberal. Big Labor groups."
1130107036,Mr. Chairman. my amendment would prohibit funds for the voluntary recall proposed rule at the Consumer Product Safety Commission and would prevent them from moving forward with a rule that would cripple the highly successful voluntary recall program that is currently in place. For nearly 40 years. the CPSC and manufacturers and retailers. big and small. have partnered to ensure that the system of voluntary recalls is effectively reducing the safety risks that are posed to the public. In fact. the CPSC recently highlighted the success of the program. noting that 90 percent of the recalls through the awardwinning Fast Track program are implemented within 20 days. The Fast Track program was created by former CPSC Chairman Ann Brown to greatly reduce the amount of time it takes recalls to be implemented. Instead of working to increase the efficiency of its programs. the CPSCs proposed rule change effectively kills its most successful program. On May 30. Ann Brown. a Democratic former Chairman appointed by President Clinton. sent a letter to the Energy and Commerce Committee expressing deep concerns over the impacts of the Commissions proposed rule. Concerning the substantive provisions of the proposal. former Chairman Brown stated: A Fast Track procedure would be rendered impossible under these circumstances. The success of this Fast Track program is based on the shared commitment of the Commission and the private sector to remove harmful products from the marketplace. The Commission. however. now seeks to transform the voluntary recall process into a legal negotiation equivalent to a settlement agreement. The proposed substantive changes would require companies seeking to implement a recall to hire an attorney to negotiate binding and enforceable terms with the CPSC staff. This places significant burdens on small businesses that use the Fast Track program because the program allows them to work with the Commission staff without having to pay expensive legal fees. The CPSC should not discourage companies from working closely. efficiently. and effectively with the CPSC when potential hazards or defects are identified. As the letter from former CPSC Chairman Brown shows. this is not a political issue. Senators from PennsylvaniaCASEY and TOOMEY. a Democrat and Republican. respectivelysubmitted a letter in January for the docket. raising concerns about the proposed changes. Senator KING sent the Commission a letter in March expressing similar concerns. and I include these letters. Mr. Chairman. from former Chairman Brown and from the Senators into the RECORD. Palm Beach Gardens. FL. May 30. 2014. Hon. FRED S. UPTON. Chairman. Committee on Energy and Commerce. Washington. DC.
1130110206,Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the time and appreciate being here on behalf of my colleagues and to have a discussion that is going to focus on what we are doing with our time. Mr. Speaker. it seems like it never fails. When we are out and about in our districts talking with our constituents. people will approach us. and they want to talk about how concerned they are about the cost of living and what they see happening to the price at the pump and to the price at the grocery store. They want to talk about how concerned they are with how much more education seems to cost them. They are concerned about our national security. They are concerned about the border security. They are concerned about their retirement security. The list goes on and on and on. They will look at us and. Mr. Speaker. without fail. they will say: Tell me exactly what you are doing about this. I want to know what you are doing to address this problem or that problem or any of the issues that all of us hardworking families are out there facing every single dayevery day. What they are looking for is solutions. What we have realized is that many times they dont know exactly how hard we are working here in the House and that the obstruction that is happening is not necessarily here in the House. What is happening is across the dome over on the Senate side. Now. I have got in front of me 300 of the 332 bills that have passed this House300 of the 332 bills that have passed this House. Now. sometimes people will say: Where are those bills sitting? Why havent they gone to the Presidents desk? Well. I always like to tell them. they are on the desk of HARRY REID. It is unfortunate. but it is where those 332 bills are languishing. Now. as we begin to look at being out of D.C. and working in our districts for August. one would think that the majority leader over in the Senate. Mr. REID. would get busy with trying to clean his desk. Most people do that. When they expect to be out of town working for a few weeks. they try to get their desk cleaned off. and they try to get things pushed out to where they need to go. They get things organized. They get things done. But that is not what we are seeing in the Senate. I had one of my constituents come up to me one day and say: Look. I am all for the Larry the Cable Guy approach. I said: Tell me what that is. They said: GitRDone. That is what people are looking for. getting the job done on behalf of hardworking taxpayers. Now. sometimes people will say: Tell me what all is in this list of things that you have done. Let me just go through what we have found in our bills that have been passed. 178 of these 332 bills. 178 of the bills passed with no opposition. none at all. There was agreement. total agreement. on these bills. One would think that the Senate majority leader would say: 178 bills in which there is complete agreement. those bills coming out of the House? Surely we can move those forward in the Senate. Surely. out of 100. we can get 60 to agree on something. But it is amazing. The Senator still has not called for a vote on those. Beyond that. 54 more bills passed under suspension. That means you had to have twothirds of this body agree. So all totaled. that is 232 of the 332 bills that have passed this body with either no opposition or twothirds of the body voting in support of that. I also find it very interesting. and probably some of our Democrat colleagues would like to join us in our Special Order tonight. because 55 of these bills55 of these billswere authored by Democrats. I am certain that they would like to see the majority leader take up their bills and push them through. Mr. Speaker. when you are so far behind in your work. you generally work nights and you work weekends. You roll up your sleeves. you buckle down. and you get the job done. But that is not what we are seeing happen coming from the Senate. What we are continuing to see is a resistance. an absolute resistance. to moving forward and taking up these bills. Now. as we go into our last week next week before our August work period. there are several issues that we would love to see the Senate address. As I said. the issues that are stacked in front of us cover everything that the American people are talking to us about. that our constituents are talking to us about when we go into our town halls. On the issue of energy. we have 16 bills that deal with the issues of energy. 16 different bills that are right here that would address energy issues. Many people have heard us talk about the Keystone pipeline. Do you realize that the bill that would address the Keystone pipeline approval you are going to find right here in this hefty stack of paper? For those who are just really concerned about what they are paying at the pumpand I dont know about you. Mr. Speaker. but I have been watching the price of a gallon of gas when I fill up my car. and in the last few months. I have gone from $3.59 to as high as $4.15 to fill that car upfar too much. For people who are paying too much at the pump. there is legislation in here that would get the cost down. It is Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America that Works. getting that price down at the pump. For individuals that feel like we are paying too much on our electricity ratesand we have all watched these rates go up. You look at that bill every month and you see. compared to last year. you are using fewer kilowatt hours but you are paying more. And you think. how could this be? Well. of course. we all remember the President saying that the prices would necessarily skyrocket under him. and he has made good on that promise. Maybe a lot of promises he hasnt made good on. but. the fact that gas was going to cost us more and electricity was going to cost us more. he is making good on that. Well. here is a bill. the Electricity Security and Affordability Act. All of these are costofliving items that we look at in our monthly budgets. energy being one of those that affects us all. everywhere we drive. when we turn on the lights. when we light the fireplace or turn on the burner of the stove to cook lunch. Bills that address those issues. they are found right in front of us. So there is plenty of work on HARRY REIDs desk. HARRY REID has been unwilling to call the vote. I know that my colleagues join me in saying we would love to see him call the vote on one of these 332 bills. At this time. I would like to yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota
1130115617,Mr. Speaker. I thank Chairman PITTS for his diligence on this effort and on behalf of the American people to allow them the choice and the options that they are seeking in their health care. My colleague is concerned that we are looking at repeals and that we are looking at replacements and we are looking at allowing choice and options for Americans. We are going to continue to do that because what we have found. Mr. Speaker. what we have found is that premiums are rising. In my State. they are going to go up another 18 to 20 percent this year. We have an insurance product in the marketplace that many of our constituents tell us is too expensive to afford. We are seeing narrowed networks. People have an insurance card. but guess what. They dont have access to the queue. They cant see the doctor. We are hearing from our hospitals that they are seeing their emergency rooms crowded. So yes. indeed. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3522. the Employee Health Care Protection Act. It is the right thing to do. If you like your health care plan. under this bill you would be able to keep your health care plan. We would be helping the President to fulfill a promise that he broke. Lets get back on track and lets fulfill that promise. This is what the American people want right now. by the administrations own admission. These arent my numbers. It is the administrations number. Up to 80 percent of the small business health plans would not make the ObamaCare cut because they are not governmentcompliant. The operative word here is they are not governmentcompliant. The government is forcing people into a plan that they dont want. dont like. and cant afford. This is the administration admitting this. They are taking away options and choice in the marketplace. We have heard from small business owners all across our district who are struggling to find ways to provide health insurance to their employees and still manage to stay in business. What they are looking for is a way to provide jobs and increase wages. ObamaCare is making it more and more difficult. We have heard from our constituents about how their insurance premiums and their copayments are escalating and the complaints they have from employees because they dont like the ObamaCare plans. We have heard that they do not understand why they are forced into purchasing governmentcompliant insurance which does not meet their needs.

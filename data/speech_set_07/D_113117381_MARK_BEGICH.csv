1130008276,"Madam President. today I would like to recognize retired LTC Dave Hoffman for his outstanding service to the United States Air Force as a search and rescue helicopter pilot. Mr. Hoffman journeyed to Alaska in the 1970s to fly helicopters in the 71st Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron. ARRS. an Air Force Unit that performed search and rescue for both civilians and military members in remote Alaska. At that time. a United States Air Force air rescue unit was considered top notch if they logged two or more ""saves"" in a year. The 71st ARRS that Dave Hoffman flew for logged over 90 saves in 1978. With temperatures dipping to 30 degrees below zero. the pilots of the 71st were often on their own in the Alaskan wilderness for days. putting their own lives at risk to save the lives of others. After his service in the USAF. Dave joined the Alaska Army National Guard. assisting his unit in countless saves. When the Air Force decided to deactivate the 71st ARRS. legislation was introduced that created the 210th Rescue Squadron. RQS. in the Alaska Air National Guard at Kulis Air National Guard Base in Anchorage. AK. Initially. as a cadre instructor pilot and later as first commander of Detachment 1. Dave Hoffman continued the tradition of greatness. By 1996. the 210th RQS had saved a record 310 lives and held the record for both the highest altitude rescue. 14.400 ft.. and the furthest rescue. 2037 miles. in an HH60G helicopter. In the fall of 1991. then Major Hoffman participated in a rescue effort less than 400 nautical miles from the North Pole where a Canadian C130 crashed. Flying night and day for over 3 days. Dave Hoffmans ability to persevere under the worst conditions resulted in saving 13 lives while managing to return all rescuers and assets unharmed. This mission earned him the Air Medal. In 1993. he was involved in the first military exercise teaming Russian and American forces on Russian soil. Lieutenant Colonel Hoffman flew with such precision during an aerial refueling that Russian General Kalugin was convinced an automated mechanism had performed the feat. When it was proven that Dave Hoffman had. in fact. piloted the helicopter. the Russian general presented him with a medal for ""superior airmanship."" Although Dave Hoffman is one of the best rescue and recovery pilots. his personality outshines his technical ability. After a rough landing. Dave is known to flash his famous smile and say. ""You know. my dashing young lieutenant. if you arent so hard on the equipment itll last longer."" His loyalty to the guard and to the men and women he served with has touched all who know him. Many recall a man who is always calm. sincere. honest. and has a great joy for life. Those who had the pleasure of flying with Dave. affectionately called ""Hoffperson"" and ""King Biscuit."" are not shy about the respect. admiration and love that they have for the man. Whether he was saving lives or sharing in them. he left a lasting glow within the recipients. On this day. I would like to honor Mr. Dave Hoffman and thank him for his service to this country. to Alaska. and to so many who are lucky enough to know him.*"
1130010234,"Mr. President. today I would like to recognize the centennial anniversary of the first successful ascent of the south peak of Mount McKinley. In Alaska. the mountain is popularly known as Denali. which means the ""Great One"" in Denaina language. At 20.320 feet. the south peak is the tallest of its two peaks. and makes Mount McKinley North Americas tallest mountain. Although other climbers attempted the climb or claimed to have summited McKinley before 1913. Walter Harper. Hudson Stuck. Robert Tatum. and Harry Karstens were the first to complete their journey to the top. Among the party. it was Harper. an Athabascan. who was the first to stand on the south summit after a monthlong expedition that started with a mush from Fairbanks by a dog team. The unsung hero of this accomplishment was another Alaska Native. 16yearold John Fredson. who travelled with the group and cared for the sled dogs at base camp while waiting for the climbing team to return. This story of triumph and courage underscores the importance of Alaska Natives in the great age of American exploration. To commemorate the centennial. the Denali 2013 Centennial Climb has been organized. The official partys ascent will commence June 7. 2013. and includes ancestors of the original team: Dana Wright of Fairbanks. the greatgrandnephew of Harper. Dan Hopkins. from Ottawa. Ontario. who is the greatgreatnephew of Stuck. Ken Karstens. from Colorado. and Ray Schuenemann. from Dallas. Texas. both of whom are greatgrandsons of Karstens. Stuck was a missionary for the Episcopal Church and Archdeacon of the Yukon back in 1913. Stuck had hoped to celebrate communion atop the peak. As part of the recreation of the historic ascent. Mark Lattime. the Episcopal Bishop of Alaska and Reverend at St. Matthews Episcopal Church in Fairbanks. will join the climbing party and celebrate communion at the peak. The spirit of adventure is something that we embrace as Alaskans and Americans. Let us take this moment to acknowledge this significant achievement of our predecessors and wish the 2013 party a safe and successful climb.*"
1130010719,Mr. President. I was not planning to come down here. I was at several meetings. As we all have in our offices. I have the screen view of the floor to figure out what action might be occurring or not occurring. I kept looking. The floor was empty. The floor was empty. And I know that earlier this afternoon. the majority leader asked that we get on the budget so it is not an empty zone here. I know people sitting up there behind me are wondering what is happening. What is happening is. the way these procedures work. which are ridiculous. you sit around and burn up time. let the clock just tick. tick. with no action because for some reason some people think this is strategic. It is not. It is what people are fed up with in this country. The leader came down and said: Lets get on with the budget. I come down. it seems every day or so. and see the charts of how many days the budget hasnt passed or how many days we have not had a budget. Here we come and offer to get onto the budget. and the other side objects. It is probably the most frustrating thing for me to see and for my constituents to see in the conference room. They say: What is happening on the floor? And I have to say: Nothing. because they are not allowing us to get to the budget. They complained for the last 21/2 or 3 years. we never get to a budget. Here we have a chance. The budget will have lots of amendments and a lot of debate. Some have said: Lets wait until after Easter. I am not waiting until after Easter. I know it is tough for people because they want to get back and fundraise and all the other stuff they do. but. you know what? They wanted us to get to the budget. and we are ready to get to the budget. Lets get to the budget and have this debate. But here we are. The camera is on me. one person. but the room is empty. It is amazing. The people behind me. quietly sitting up there observing because they are not allowed to say anything. are wondering what is going on. as are many of my constituents. As a former member of the Budget Committee. I can tell you budgets are not easy. This budgetit doesnt matter where you may be on itstarts to cut the budget. starts reducing the deficit. and starts dealing with it. I am happy to debate it. I am not sure where I am going to be at the end of the day on this budget. but I am happy to debate it. Anytime today would be good. But instead. what people want to do. through a parliamentary procedure. is just burn off hours. So people sit around waiting for the time to end. Then we come down and debate. Mr. President. I know you are new. I am kind of new but not as new as you are. and it is probably what you hear back home. as I still do today. the frustration level at how this place operates. Here we are. We had a chance earlier this morningearlier this afternoon to move forward on the budget. and they objected because they didnt want the two times between the CR and the budgetI know this is a little process thing. a little wonkyto simultaneously run. The fact is. we could have done that because obviously they care so much about the budget? They are not down here. Maybe if we get to the budget. they would come down and talk about their objections. as I have. I said publicly that I am going to look at the budget that has come forward. I want to make sure there are enough cuts in there. make sure they are real cuts that last a long time because we have to get this budget under control. this deficit under control. We want to make sure we continue to move this economy forward with the right kind of sustainable budget over the long haul. I am happy to debate it. I am looking forward to it. My poor staff didnt know I was coming down here. and I said I am coming down anyway and walked down the hall and got frustrated because we could be doing this. Here is what is going to happen. I can see it already. Come Thursday. we will be in a mad dash around here. turning around. working double timewhich is finerushing amendments. Instead. we could have a deliberative process right nowright now on the budget. That is what we should be doing. That is what the American people want. That is what Alaskans tell me every day: Debate it and debate the issues. I am anxious. Maybe we will ask again to get consent by the other side to get on with the budget. but they have already objected to that. I am shocked. I think the American people would be shocked. But no one is down here. so it is hard not to be shocked when there is no debate. I wanted to come down here in a little bit of frustration and make my point heard. that we have a chancewe could have had a chance earlier today to start this budget debate. We did not. Now we are just waiting for the clock to tick. It is really somewhat embarrassing. as someone said in the Senate. that I came here to get stuff done. not to sit around waiting for time to run out because people want to use the process to drag on their political desires rather than what we should be doing here: getting on with getting this economy moving. making sure jobs are created. and doing everything we can to get the budget under control and make sure the longterm sustainability of the government continues. I thank the Chair for the indulgence. allowing me a couple of minutes down here to maybe rant and complain about a process that I thought was going to start at 2:30and yet nothing. My guess is that they will not consent. They will burn the time. The American people will get frustrated. Then we will finally get into the debate. it will be rushed instead of having a long. good. positive deliberation. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
1130049141,To my colleague from North Carolina. thank you for the part about explaining the process. Some people think by tomorrow if there is a vote on defunding. suddenly something happens. Thank you for pointing out the issue of the statute. We may not agree on the total picture. but I have presented lots of ideas on how to fix the health care act. I would be anxious to work on that as we pass by tomorrow. I thank the Senator for his comments. I know in the last 48 hours or longer we have been talking about a lot of issues. We have been talking about health care. and I can read all kinds of stories about people who called me. such as the 50yearold male from rural Alaska who was selfemployed. He had lung cancer. Today. because of ACHIA and the ability to get into that highrisk pool. he now is living a good life. healthier. and running his business. I can go through all kinds of stories. but I dont want us to forget the big issue that is facing us Tuesday. that is. the risk of a government shutdown and what that means. We can talk about health care for a long time. We will for generations. and they have done it for generations before I even got here. We need to focus on the big issue that faces us. that is. this shutdown that is potentially in front of us. The inability of Congress to pass a budget. pass annual appropriations bills. address these harmful automatic budget cuts known around here as sequester. because of true political brinksmanship. is honestly shameful and not why I came to Congress. When the budget passed. I didnt vote for it. but it passed. The House has a budget. it passed. Now for some reason we cant get people from the minority to sit down and let us move to a conference committee to figure this out. To me. it is amazing. It is a simple thing. For the time I have been here. 3 years at minimum. we have been hearing there is no budget passed. There is one passed. I didnt vote for the one that passedit had too many taxesbut it did pass. Lets get on with the conference committee and figure it out. The Presiding Officer. my colleague from Montana. and I are on the Appropriations Committee. We passed bills out of the Appropriations Committee and most of them passed in some form of bipartisanshipnot 100 percent but in some form. Bringing those forward would be helpful. It would help us to do the job we were sent to do on an annual basis. that is. to get our budget moving forward. I came to get the job done. I came to Washington to represent Alaska. I didnt come to participate in this backandforth showmanship that has to go on in order for someone to get some highlight on TV or be able to get some byline on TV or whatever it might be. These games that are being played and played on the Senate floor are affecting our national homeland security. Think about it. What is it like for a Federal employee today as they watch these shenanigans that go on. If you are one of the 5.000 dedicated Department of Defense employees in Alaska. you didnt get paid for 6 days already this year because of sequestration. Now you are wondering if you are going to get a paycheck on time or face more furloughs because this institution may not be able to pass a clean continuing resolution. For those who are watching. the continuing resolution says the budget we have is going to continue for a short time while we try to get our appropriations bills to the floor so we can move those forward. It is not complicated. It keeps the government running. and it is the way we move this system forward. but it is not the right approach. We need to have regular order for our appropriations bills and get rid of the sequestration issue once and for all. Dont be confused about the issue. I know people like to complain about the Federal Government. We are the largest service provider in the country. We provide services. We dont make widgets. We produce service. We build roads. We are out there taking care of forest fires when they are happening. We are taking care of our veterans. We are making sure we are protected in the homeland as well as across the world with our national defense. The list goes on and on. We are a service company. As I stand here. I am honestly stunned we are on the verge again. I dont know how many times we have been on the edge. just hanging over the edge of what might happen. Will we close down the government? I am not here to do that. As painful as these days are in going through the process. we need to move forward. We cannot delay military members paychecks. leaving them wondering if they are going to get paid again or if they can pay their bills on time. knowing we will face the same situation again and again in a few months. We need to finish this so we can move on to the annual Department of Defense bill to continue to fund this Federal Government. Many of our military members are also wondering if they will be training. waiting for the missions we call them out to do. Commanders cant plan a training exercise now. such as the Red FlagAlaska. which is a critical training program. not only for our military but our allies. They dont know how much money they will have in the next fiscal year to plan. They cant just decide on a Thursday. Friday. and the next week we are doing a massive military mission. It takes months of planning. but they cant plan if they dont have the resources. Military leaders are not only losing sleep over the rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea. they are losing sleep over not having the funds to pay their workforce and breaking faith with their troops as we ask them to do so much. We are asking the one organization we rely on to be ready 24 hours a day. 7 days a week. 365 days a year. and to stay ready amidst uncertainty and potential shutdowns. We are asking its members to carry on without expecting pay or money to train. It is unrealistic. it is unreasonable. and it is risky for our national security. Our Nations veteransand we have 77.000 veterans in Alaskaare wondering what the shutdown means for the claims they are waiting for. They are wondering if the process will create even lengthier delays in an already unacceptably slow process. I know the Presiding Officer and I have worked to try to streamline this process to get these claims resolved after hundreds of days of delay. Our Nations homeless veterans are wondering if they will be able to get their housing vouchers or lose them in budget cuts or if they will have to sleep on the streets after serving our country because we cant pass a continuing resolution and a budget. In Alaska. let me tell you what that is like in October. moving into November and into December. Sleeping on the streets is not a comfortable situation. Sleeping on the streets. period. is not a comfortable situation. But when you are in those cold situations. it is even worse. We are hurting local economies and stifling potential job growth. We have $202 million of military construction that will be delayed in Alaska because we havent passed an annual Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill. We passed it in appropriations. we are ready. and we want to do it. but this backandforth of 1 week. 1 month. 2 months. continuing resolution again delays the regular order so we can create certaintycertainty with our ability to provide for businesses in this country but also for the business community. construction companies. In Alaska you cannot just start a project in December and say. well. we are going to start doing the foundation work. It is a little cold. The ground is a little frozen. You have to be doing this in the summer. You have to be planning for this in the winter and late spring. For us to delay these projects. all we do is hurt the private sector jobs related to it. the families who depend on this. the veterans. and the military that depend on these important construction projects. When the funding comes too late. the project is delayed. costs go up. It is not complicated. For the Senate. I have learned over time it is almost irrelevant. Some people dont care about it. They dont care what it costs. They dont even want to know. because they know when they hear it. it will be an unbelievable cost that we have to bear because of this delay and these tactics. I get it. We are not going to always agree on everything. but we have to compromise and solve these problems. As an appropriator. that is what we do in appropriations. It is not always easy. Some things I want to have happen. we cant have. It is the same thing on the other side. but at the end of the day we find common ground. Sequestration also has hurt the Coast Guard. In Alaska. the Coast Guard is the lifeblood of our oceans for the fishing industry. oil and gas industry. our recreational industry. our cruise ship industry. I can go through the list. They have lost $200 million from their operating expenses because of sequestration and an inability for some people to come to the table to solve this problem. That means about 30 percent fewer cutters and aircraft doing things such as enforcing fishing laws. We have a reduced presence in the Arctic. They had to cut back on patrols to stop drugs coming from South America into this country. When you think about it. the impact is significant. It spreads throughout this whole country. As the drugs come in and the jobs in the country go out. millions of Americans are watching to see what Congress does. We have created a situation where not only are we unable to budget for this country. but Americans cant budget for their future. They cant even budget for the holiday season. It is unbelievable. We need to complete this work on this shortterm continuing resolution. move right into our annual appropriations bills. address sequestration once and for all. and finish the budget. We owe it to the American people. We owe it to them to ensure they have certainty. and we owe to it our business community to make sure they know. Look at last week in the market. It wasnt a deep slide. but it was a slide. If you read the Wall Street Journal today or last night. there is a commentary and some articles because they werent sure what the House was doing. The House was playing these games back and forth: Lets tie this to it. lets tie that to it. They are playing with an economy that has come back from the depths of a great recession. Is it a perfect economy? No. Is it better? Absolutely. Do we have a fragile moment that we need to continue to build on this? Yes. I am not sure if those folks on the other side care about making sure our economy is strong. In some ways. I think they want it to falter so they can go into an election and say: See those guys. they caused the economy to go bad so vote them out. That is all this seems to be. I was presiding earlier and one of my colleagues on the other side mentioned a story about Alaska. I was appreciative that he recognized Alaska and understood we had some issues in Alaska. Then he mentioned three other Senators and their Statesall the ones. to be frank with you. who are being targeted by groups as the ones most at risk this election cycle. I get it. but that is not what people are here to do. If you want to have that conversation. lets go outside this building. Run those ads. Do everything you need to do. Do whatever you want on the campaign trail. Do whatever you need to do. To play these games and try to pretend you are doing the governments business is very irresponsible. That is not what is going on. What is going on is picking people and trying to pigeon hole them so they can run commercials against them in campaigns. I get that. I think the American people are fed up with it. They are outraged by it. I hear it every time I go back to Alaska. I hear it when I talk to people around the country. We have to do the work we were sent to do. The work here is to get our business done. Setting policy is part of it and passing appropriations bills. We should be doing these on an annual basis. doing a budget. Again. we passed one out of the Senate. I didnt support it because it had too many taxes. but we passed it. The House passed it. Lets get on with doing the work. Every day I know some sit around and they say: Well. we have to do it this way. This is the only way it works. You dont understand. The Senate is complicated. Hey. life is complicated. get on with it. The public expects us to do our job. Quit using process. rules. and gobbledygook to try to get away from your responsibility in the Senate. It is time we sit down and deal with it. There will be some in my party. and there will be some in their party whoguess whatarent going to get what they want. That is the way it works. Compromise. find your balance. and move forward. I would love 100 percent of everything. I will try it every day. but that is not how it ends up all the time. Compromise and try to find a middle ground. that is what we should be doing. As an appropriator. that is what I want to do. This is what I tried to do as a member of the Appropriations Committee. and that is what we should be doing on this floor. I get it. There are a couple on each side. It happens. We saw one who stood out here for 21 hours or whatever the heck it was. I get it. He is passionate. It is important to him to make his point. but I also see what else is going on. Focus on your job. We are Senators. We are not candidates for some other office. We are Senators. We are here to do the job. It is time to get busy and do the job. The American people want it. Alaskans tell us every day they want us to do this. Lets figure this out and get on with the show. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1130053527,I thank my good friend for allowing me to take a few minutes and ask a couple of points. Mr. President. I am here to say that is what this debate is about. a simple question. allowing a vote on the House side. If they do not have the votes. because obviously the Speaker there believes he doesnt have the votes and he doesnt support it being voted on. let it be on the floor. it will fail. and we will go back to the drawing board. But the reality is he knows the votes are there. We would be out of this shutdown. The result would be people would be back to work. services will be provided. and businesses will not be losing the confidence they are losing every day or like the market once again. Since this debate started. the threats of shutdown. of actual shutdown. the stock market over the last 15. 16 days has lost almost 600 points. Most people do not pay a lot of attention to that. But if you have an education account. a 401(k) account. a retirement account. an IRA. or you have a little money set aside. it has a direct impact to your livelihood over the long haul. I encourage the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Speaker BOEHNER. to allow a simple vote. We have. on every bill that has come over here. They have not prevailed. but we allowed a vote. That is the process. But over there they refuse to do it. They keep sending back gimmicks. It is hard for me to understand this logic. They want to pay every single Federal employee. but they are only going to have some of them come back to work. It makes no sense. If you are paying your employees. have them come back and work. I run a small business. my wife runs a small business. I know the Senator from Montana. who just left here. runs a small business. You dont pay your people not to come to work. When you pay them to work. you pay them to work. The Presiding Officer was a Governor. He would not say one day: Oh. by the way. I am going to pay everyone. stay home for a month. No. he would have them come to work when he is paying them unless they have leave or vacation time. This is crazy. It passes unanimously on the House side. Then they say: But we dont want you to work. The taxpayers should be outraged about that. I want to vote on that bill. I want to vote on that furlough bill here. I want to make sure everyone gets paid. and then I went to follow it up with the CR and put everyone back to work. That is what we should be doing here. not these games where they bring over political statements with the items they are bringing over. Do we want to vote against veterans? I have a higher per capita number of veterans in my State than any other State. Veterans are important to our economy. They have served our country. They deserve every benefit. But to play this game of leveragingthe American people see right through this. These guys who keep bringing these little schemes over here are thinking they are one step ahead of the American people. They are absolutely wrong. The American people are two or three steps ahead of us. They see the showandtell that is going on and it doesnt make sense. Again. if you are going to fund all the employeesagain. 435 to 0 they voted to fund all the employees who get paid. but then they only want some of them to go to work. It makes no sense to me at all. I appreciate the time of the Presiding Officer allowing me the opportunity to engage with a couple of my colleagues here. but every time they spoke I wanted to explain and show kind of the farce that is going on over there and what is happening over there with a small group of the tea partyvery small. 30. 40 Members over there. who decided they are going to run the government here. The government is not run by one group. it is run by compromise and negotiation. We have negotiated all the way down to their number. we have put every one of their bills on the floor and voted on them. Now all we ask is one simple vote. a clean CR that sits in the Speakers office. ready to be put on the floor. He even says it will fail. OK. Lets see. Lets see where his votes are. Lets see where it all is. If it fails. we will be right back to where we are today. no difference. What does he fear? He fears the fact it will pass. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
1130059251,Mr. President. In October of 2013. Veterans in the Last Frontier and AlaskaGolden Heart hubs of Honor Flight will be traveling to Washington. DC. to visit their memorials. I would like to welcome these heroes to our Nations capital and take this time to recognize their service to our Nation. I would like to record the individual names of the World War II veterans selected for this trip: Mr. Jacob Knapp. Army. Mr. Stanley Coleman. Navy. Mr. John Collins. Army. Mr. William Field. Navy. Mr. Alvin Hershberger. Army. Mr. Norman Hogg. Army. Mr. Howard Hunt. Army. Mr. Alfred Kehl. Army. Mr. George Miller. Air Force. Mr. Manuel Norat. Army. Mr. Leonard Nugent. Navy. Mr. Dale Parker. Navy. Mr. Fredrick Samsun. Marines and Air Force. Mr. Marshall Solberg. Navy. Mr. Lafton Wells. Navy. Ms. Ellen White. Air Force. Ms. Juliana Wilson. Navy. Mr. Allen Woodward. Navy. Mr. Edward Young Jr.. Air Force. Mr. James Brewster. Navy. Mr. Elvin Brush. Air Force. Mr. Arnold Booth. Army. Mr. Conrad Ryan. Army. Mr. William Miller. Army. Mr. Louis Palmer. Navy. Mr. James Dodge. Marines. Mr. Roy Helms. Army. Mr. Nelson McBirney. Navy and Mr. Wenzel Raith. Navy. These veterans from Alaska join over 90.000 other veterans from across the country. who. since 2005. have traveled to our Nations capital to visit and reflect at memorials built here in their honor. This Honor Flight trip was made possible by generous public donations and contributions from those who wish to honor these heroes. We owe a great deal to our servicemen and veterans who put themselves in harms way for our Nation and for our security. The sacrifices made by these heroes are truly incredible and without their honor. courage. commitment. and sacrifice. we would not enjoy the freedoms we cherish today. Each of these veterans have my thanks for their service. and I very appreciate the staff. volunteers and supporters of the Honor Flight program who make these trips happen. Again. thank you to all Alaska veterans and the volunteers for their dedication. commitment. and service.
1130082884,Madam President. I rise today to remember the Great Alaskan Earthquake. which struck 50 years ago today on Good Friday. March 27. 1964. Over 100 Alaskans died in the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Entire coastal towns were literally wiped off the map. I was very youngonly 2 years oldbut I remember my family telling stories as I was growing up and showing pictures. In those days it was not like we see todaypictures on a computerbecause there was none of that existing. I remember in our family of six we always had slideshow night. We had these little slides my mother would put in this carousel. and off it would go and we would be reminded of all the vacations and things we went on. but we would also see these slides about what happened in the earthquake in 1964. We were lucky. We lived in East Anchorage in half of a small apartment complex. and the only things that broke in our house were these three swinging lights that went back and forth because our house was built on gravel soil and was very strong and sturdy. in many ways. in its development. But when you look back at the houses on Third Avenue that literally disappeared or Fourth Avenue that collapsed downtown. it was a different story. or around Turnagain. the community out in West Anchorage. that literally fell off and sank. Today I am honored to join my colleague Senator MURKOWSKIwho I know was on the floor earlierin cosponsoring a resolution marking the tragic yet important event in our history and thanking those who helped us survive and recover. In those days we had limited access anyway. but when there was an earthquake. especially in a small town or community. the first responders sometimes couldnt get there because of the uniqueness of the situation from the earthquake. But every Alaskan. every first responder. everybody who was available got down to the business of doing everything they could to help people in need. We were coming out of a winterstill cold and yet spring. what we would call a spring winter day. Alaskans know the importance of tsunami preparedness and warnings and making sure we are prepared for what can happen. Today we are proud to host NOAAs National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer. AK. I have been there. and it is the most amazing technology. to see what we can do and what we can see or sense through the sensors and other scientific equipment we have to tell us when a tsunami may be occurring or the magnitude of the tsunami. We monitor on a 24hour basis with scientists. The tsunamis impact was felt. from our earthquake. as far away as Hawaii. California. and Washington. That is why today I join Senator CANTWELL and Senator SCHATZ in introducing the Tsunami Warning and Educational Reauthorization Act for 2014. This bill would improve NOAAs Tsunami Warning Center. bringing supercomputing power to the tsunami modeling. It would ensure that all coastal weather forecast offices are better prepared to issue tsunami warnings. The bill also ensures that coastal communities will be more tsunamiresilient through the National Tsunami Hazardous Mitigation Program. It ensures that communities understand tsunami risks. planning to minimize damages. and are ready to bounce back quickly after the damage occurs. The bill also recognizes the critical role that advancing our understanding and technology through scientific research plays in meeting the tsunami threat. This bill was originally envisioned by the late Senator Inouye. I have been proud to pick up where he was unable to continue on an issue I know is critical in his home State. Fifty years ago Alaska was a young State with a bright but uncertain future. We still had foreign fishing vessels coming in and taking our fish just a few miles off the coast. The transAlaska oil pipeline and the energy it delivers was just a dream. After the damage from the quake and tsunami. there were serious questions from outside whether Alaska could survive. Keep in mind that this was only a few years after becoming a State. But Alaskans already knew the answer. They knew we would rebuild and become stronger. and we have. Alaska is now the Nations Arctic energy storehouse and feeds the Nation with sustainable seafood stocks. I know the Presiding Officer understands the value of fisheries and that they are an incredible element of our food inventory and storage for our country. Alaska is a State that is important in this regard. as is the State of Massachusetts. But we must still be very vigilant against the threat of earthquakes and tsunamis. That is why I introduced this bill. joining again with Senators CANTWELL and SCHATZ in this endeavor. We encourage its swift passage. as it is important to make sure. when it comes to these issues. that no matter where one lives. safety is protected because the devastation is incredible. Let me end on another personal note. When I think of growing up in Alaskasomeone born and raised thereand living in East Anchorage. I can still remember growing up and my dad thinking about where he bought land to build this house. and this apartment building was on incredible soil. But years later. when I became mayor of Anchorage and sat on the city assembly. I remember the great debate on building codes and earthquake capacity and stability and making sure buildings were designed right. I remember the Federal building. which is now city halland I was on the Anchorage Assembly thenand the great debate came up as to whether we were going to renovate or move or something else in regard to the location. But we decided we wanted to stay downtown to keep downtown vibrant. Well. the building was built during a time when it would probably not withstand an earthquake of the magnitude that occurred in the 1964 earthquake. I remember when we vacated the building and they stripped the building down and left the shell. I walked in to take a tour of the building with the developer. He was showing me what he called the shock absorbersthese incredible columns within the building that. if an earthquake hit. not only would they try to absorb it. they would help the building move up or side to side. absorbing the impact of the earthquake and preserving the building. ensuring that the investment and lives would be saved. To me. it was the most amazing thing because in the old daysas I said. when I grew upwe just put the buildings together. slapped them up. and thanked God we had a home to live in during a cold winter. So the technology has advanced significantly so as to ensure safety in an area that is clearly an earthquake zone. It is not uncommon for me to be back home and be at a meeting in a hotel or giving a speech in a ballroom or sitting in a home with someone and having a conversation and an earthquake kind of comes through. It is always amazing to me that if I am there with visitors from out of town. they get a little nervous. But as Alaskans. we know we have improved our building codes. we have improved our warning systems. and we have continued to make sure we can minimize or mitigate the damage from those natural disasters that could occur. Again. this bill reauthorization on tsunamis focuses on that. We saw a whole city or town washed off the mapgonebecause of the power of a tsunami. So today I appreciate and remember the history of Alaska and the uniqueness of being there during times of growth and also times of tragedy. but today being part of legislation which in an odd way comes full circle: As a 2yearold experiencing an earthquake. to where I am today. being able to ensure that not only my State but any coastal State has the capacity to ensure a tsunami warning system is not only the best but the best in the world. I yield the floor.
1130122790,Madam President. I was not intending to come down here. I was getting ready to leave to see my 12yearold son who just got home from school and make sure that he has dinner and do all the things that a parent would do. but I heard a speech earlier todayand I just heard another oneand it is like revisionist history. It is amazing to me to hear them talk about information that they claim is informationand really when you listen carefully. it is really more of the same. I agree with my colleague who was just here that people want something different as the new Congress comes in. I will not be here. as the Presiding Officer knows. but that does not mean I will not be a participant in my community and also making comments when I hear things. But what I heard was they are going to finally get to economic development and improve the economy. The two Members who spoke today whom I heard were here when I came to the Senate in 2009. and a few years later the Presiding Officer came to the Senate. People may have forgotten where this economy was in 2009. The stock market was in dismal shape. I believe it was around 6.500 or 6.800somewhere in that range. Unemployment was at 10 percent. and the pundits and economists all said it was growing. Approximately 700.000 jobs were lost per month. Two of the three largest U.S. automobile companies were basically on their back and about to go bankrupt. New housing starts didnt exist. and prices of homes across the country were crashing. Consumer confidence was at the lowest point I have ever seen in I dont know how many years. The deficit wasannuallyabout $1.4 trillion. I know what happens these daysbecause I have experienced it for the last several yearsis news by the minute. What happens today in this moment of time are these oneliners and I can tell they are very synchronized today. They said that the economy was bad. and is still bad. and the bright spot is around the corner. Actually. you have to look at where we are today. 6 years later. The stock market is at 17.000plus. What does that mean? It means that people who have retirement accounts. such as 401(k)s or 529sputting money aside for their kids educationhave had their value come back. For my home State. which receives a benefit called the permanent fund checkwe invest in the stock market with oil revenues we put aside constitutionally. and it is put in the permanent fund and a check is issued once a year. Guess what? This year the check is double from what it was last year. Why is that? Because it works on a 5year average. Going backwardsI took the year 2009 off. it was a very bad yearwhat happened to the permanent fund check? It doubled this year in Alaska. which meant that people got that money in their pocket and spent it on the economy and helped to grow the economy. Where is unemployment today? It is at 5.8 percent nationallya 50percent drop. GM. Ford. and Chrysler have added 500.000 jobs since mid2009. I know that today was like revisionist history. Amnesia has set into some people over there. They want to recreate the news because the good news is hard to talk about because it is reality. Now. there is still a challenge. The Presiding Officer has talked about this a great deal. and that is that people are still working harder and longer because the incomes have not gone up enough. They have not seen it come down to them yet. but they have seen it in certain elements. Housing prices are up. In the one single largest investment an individual makes in a lifetimetheir housing prices are back up. Gasoline pricesI have no idea if my colleagues fill up their cars with gas. I do. I know what it costs to fill up my tank. and it costs less now. The average price across the country now is about $2.77. In my State. it is about $3.35. But we were up to $5 in the urban areasbut not anymore. I saw the statistic today. and I wrote it down. I think I have this right. The price of oil has gone down and so has the price of gasoline. What does that save consumers every day? It saves consumers $630 million a day in current prices. It means that consumers are benefiting from that. When you look at job growthI believe we are in our 55th straight month of privatesector job growth. Again. we dont have it fully trickling down to the wages yet. but first we have to right the economy. I know the voters have made a decision. Before I came in. the economy was a disaster. Before the Presiding Officer came in. the economy was barely recovering. But I will not sit here and listen to revisionist history. As a matter of fact. the consumer confidence level is the highest this month since 2007. That means consumers are finally feeling it a little bit. There is still more to go. But to pretend that nothing has happened over the last 6 yearsI cant use the words on the floor here because it would be disrespectfulis just not true. It has changed. We still have more work to do. As a matter of fact. the tax extender billthe items they didnt want to support permanently would have brought it to every single family that is still struggling. But I know there are tax provisions they want for the NASCAR owners. the horseracing owners. I get that. Those are their issues. I understand that. But we have to be realistic. Also. the deficit. Think about this. When I came to the Senate in 2009. the annual deficit in this country was $1.4 trillion. Today. it is $480 billion. It has dropped by $1 trillion per year. Now do we want it to be zero? Yes. Do we want to have a surplus so we can start paying off the debt? Absolutely. But we have to get recovery firstget some treatment. which is what we have been doingand then reinvest in the future. That means infrastructure. education. and objectives that matter to everyday Americans and everyday Alaskans. I sit here and listen to these comments. Today it happened a little bit before 12:30 p.m.. before our caucus break. because we usually break at 12:30 p.m. and I was going to go home. I turned onmy mistake. I turned on the station and I heard the commentary and I thought. Jacob is going to have to wait a little bit for dinner and I am going to come to the floor. because it is amazing to me. Exportsbusinesses we create in this country we ship out. up 37 percent over the last several years. I will give an example of a company in Alaska. When I was campaigning. I ran into this company in Fairbanks. They had their manufacturing plant in China. Do my colleagues know where they have it now? It is in Fairbanks. AK. They moved it from China to Fairbanks. I told them they should put a 4by8 sign out there and say. We take jobs from China and bring them home. They are all good jobs. As a matter of fact. they are union jobs. So when people talk about how unions are destroying the countrythey actually brought jobs back that are union jobs. paying good wages. good benefits. and took it from China and brought it to Fairbanks. AK. It is unbelievable what they do. They do business not only in Alaska. but in Hawaii and other places. I listened over and over again today. and I want to make sure peoplealso I should mention housing prices are up. new housing starts are up. which is important for the construction industry. It creates jobs and makes sure we have competition so prices are stabilized over time. Retail sales are strong. I have no idea if my colleague who spoke earlier has ever been in business. He talked about the 179 depreciation. I have actually used it because I have been in small business. I have no idea if he understands how it works. but for small businesses. it is a big deal. It is why Democrats have supported that time and time again. As a matter of fact. we had it in the minimum wage bill we brought to the floor. the 179 extension. which they voted against. they did not supportraising the minimum wage. bringing people out of poverty and. by the way. helping small businesses expand and invest so they can grow more. As someone who used the 179 more than onceas a matter of fact. my wife has small businesses and is now expanding and investing and is using the 179 depreciation. I hear what they are saying. but I dont know if they understand how it is used. When we had the minimum wage bill. coupled with 179. it seemed to make a lot of sense. but they didnt like that. either. So I wanted to come to the floor because I think it is important that we. No. 1. dont take things out of context. They mentioned Senator SCHUMERS speech several times. They should read the whole speech. because I think they selected verbiage. I dont agree 100 percent with his comments. but I agree with the concept. We actually did two things. We worked on health care and we worked on the economy. I see people sometimes when they eat their food. they eat one piece at a timetheir carrots first. and then their potato. and then their steak. We actually did a little bit of everything. We dealt with health care. because it was crushing the economy. but we dealt with the economy overall. We had to take votes on a regular basis that the other side would never do. because we bet on America. And the result is 6 years later. here we are. The economy is better. It is stronger. It needs more work. there is no question about it. We need to get the deficit to zero and get a surplus. and knock the debt down. That was driven up not just by this administration but by past administrations as well. They forgot about the two wars they didnt pay for. The extender bill is not paid for. We didnt hear one word about how that tax extender bill is not going to be paid for. It is going to be another part of the debt. But 4 or 5 months agomy colleagues may remember thiswe were on the floor debating veterans care. and all they said is how are we going to pay for it. Well. the veterans paid. but we had to find a way. But here we are going to give more corporate tax relief without paying for itexcept actually we do pay for it. Everyday Americans will pay for it with their taxes. and the debt. and interest on the debt. So we have to be clear about that. I think about where we were. what we did. and where we are. It is significantly different than 6 years ago. It is better. I agree there is more work to be done to make sure we get more of the revenue stream and opportunities in the hands of individualshardworking Alaskans. hardworking folks from Massachusetts. and hardworking folks across this country. That is our next obligation. But to come to the floor and say the economy is a disaster is irresponsible. It is not correct. The numbers tell us differently. Actually. even the conservative Forbes. Wall Street Journal. and all of these other magazines and newspapers that I read are now talking about how the economy is moving because we have had this consecutive pattern which really tells how the economy is improving. That is important. The last thing I will say from a purely Alaska perspective is not only are exports important to us because we do a lot of business overseaswe have seen exports increase. Our unemployment in Anchorage. for example. the city I am from. is 4.9 percenta pretty good economy. Our fisheries industry. which I know the Presiding Officer and I share78.000 jobs are connected to thata $5 billion. almost $6 billion industry. Our tourism industry is up. with 2 million overall visitors to our State. again. generating income. There is more activity happening around the country than ever before. and my State is seeing it every single day. But to come to the floor and continue to be naysayers and talk about how bad things are is really not responsible. We have done a great job. Can we do better? Absolutely. That is what we strive for every single day. And I hopeand I say this to the Presiding Officer because I will not be here after Januarythat they dont take the position where they are mad at immigration so now they are not going to do these economic development issues. or they are mad at something else and they take it out on some other program. We are going to havethe Presiding Officer will have differences with her colleagues. on immigration. maybe. on health care. on the economy. but we have to find common ground. The economy is a constant issue. and where investments should happen if we really want to have an impact down the road is investing in infrastructure. education. relievingas the Presiding Officer has tried to dorelieving debt from students and families. There is now a $1.4 trillion debt. I think. on families for student loans. It is outrageous. We should be lowering those rates. Also. as tax reform issues come up. which they will next year. I hope the Senate and the House look at objectives such as making a big impact for individual families. lowering the rates for individual families. hardworking families. if we want to put cash in their pockets. if we want to change the dynamics. give them more of their money back. not the top 1 percent or even the top 10 percent. but I am talking about the folks we see every dayI see every dayout there working hard. We need to make sure they can start putting money aside for college education for their kids. putting money aside for retirement. spending more in the economy. because maybe that car that is 15 years old isnt running so well anymore. That is what I hope we do. Individual relief is more important than corporate relief or the top 1 percent. On top of that. when we talk about corporate tax relief. never forget who really is driving the economy. It is the small business owners. including the limited liability corporations. the subchapter S corporations. the sole proprietor individuals. They all get taxed by individual rates. We will hear about corporate rate relief. which is important to be competitive. but that is for the big guys. But the guys we see every daywhen we go to the cleaners. a sole proprietor. go to a restaurant. sole proprietor. maybe it is an LLCthey are not going to see that benefit unless we lower the rates for them. That is what we should be doing if we want to make a difference for them. Because they will use the 179 depreciation. The 179 has a limit. The big boys use it a little bit. but the limit is really designed for small businesses to reinvest. But if their tax rates are still too high. they wont be able to take advantage of that as much as they can. We want them to take advantage. I didnt mean to take time here at the end of the evening. I know lots of times people want to get out. But. honestly. I couldnt sit there and listen to the revisionist history that continues to go on. The elections are over. I know now it is called the Obama economy. That is a new phrase. It is really collectively all of our economy. because we participated in trying to save it. They have objected to it for the last 6 years. so by their objection. they get to be a part of not having the result that maybe they wanted. but the result is the economy is much better. We need to do more work to make sure it gets into the hands of the individual out there. I know that is a priority to the Presiding Officer. But if I continue to hear it. I will continue to come to the floor and speak. because people cant get away with just saying over and over again that they are stating the facts. because the facts are very clear as I just stated. The stock market has gone up. Unemployment has dropped. Housing is up. Housing starts are up. The two largest automobile companies. all three of them now. over a half a million new jobs. Fiftyfive consecutive months of growth. That is all good news and we should be proud of it. The Presiding Officer should be proud of it and the Senate should be proud of it. But there is no room for revisionist history when we talk about the fact of where we were 6 years ago and where we are today. I appreciate the time and yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
1130125831,Madam President. I will be brief. but I want to thank both Senators on the floor. Senators BOXER and VITTER. for working on this issue. It was critical for Alaskas fishermen and really for fishermen across the country. More importantly this will resolve the issue with the Coast Guard bill. which is critical to get done for many other reasons. First. on the discharge issue. as stated earlier. this is an important waiver for our fishermen in Alaska. This will ensure that a regulation that wasnt going to have any positive impact with regards to what they were attempting to do but would have a negative impact in regards to our fishermengiving them a 3year waiver is exceptional because every year we would have a 1year waiver. So a 3year waiver is fantastic. but I agree with Senator BOXER that this should be permanent. I would like to watch from the outside in to see how this develops over the years. The Coast Guard authorization bill was critical to get done. This has many important provisions. As the chair of the committee that dealt with the Coast Guard bill. not only this year but 2 years ago. we have been successful now at least since I have been chair to ensure the bill passed by unanimous consent and not to have big fights over working out the differences. Again. I thank Senator VITTER for his effort. making sure we move forward on this piece of legislation. The issue I want to highlightand then I will closeis that the Coast Guard bill is not only important for our fishermen in Alaska. the 79 feet and under ships. but also many other things. It ensures additional resources for the Arctic and Antarctic and ensures icebreaking capabilities. including extending the service life of the currently idled Polar Sea. It enhances vessel safety information regarding ice and weather conditions and improves the oil spill prevention and response capabilities. It also ensures availability of quality childcare for our Coast Guard personnel. We require Coast Guard personnel to go all over this country. Part of it is their families are obviously with them and making sure they have quality of life aspects that are important for us to continue to recruit and get the best of the best. It also creates educational and portable career opportunities for ActiveDuty Coast Guard spouses and eases the transition for Coast Guard personnel into postservice life. It provides inflation adjustment for funding levels for something very important to us in Alaska. the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Committee. This group of citizens is involved in ensuring that the community at Cook Inletthere is a lot of oil activity and fishing activity and other types of activities that are in that regionand citizens are engaged in their input. It is not just industry. but it is industry and citizens working together. This ensures that their funding continues and is inflation adjusted for the future. That is important. Lastly. a small item. but it allows the Commandant to issue leases on tidelands and submerged lands. That is important because there are parcels of property that the Coast Guard controls that are adjacent to communities. and we need to make sure that there is flexibility for them to do the work they need to do. This piece of legislation was cosponsored by Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senators THUNE. RUBIO. MARIA CANTWELL and many others. This truly is a bipartisan piece of legislation and an example of what we do best when we work together. Imagine a piece of legislation such as this. an authorization legislation for one of our large agencies. the Coast Guard. now the second time happening without a big fight on the floor. without this back and forth between the House and Senate. but actually getting the work done so our Coast Guard personnel know they have a budget that improves upon their quality of life issues and in my case in Alaska. making sure the Arctic is taken care of. We also increased and made sure the Coast Guard ongoing replacement programs are there. with $1.5 billion to continue to increase and improve the Coast Guard programs for our country. which is also very important. Again. I want to thank the body. thank the folks on both sides of the aisle. As chair of the committee. it was my honor to be able to move this forward. but also I want to give a special thanks to all my staff members who worked on this because without the Senate staff who participated in this work. we could not have gotten the work done. I appreciate that. I yield the floor.

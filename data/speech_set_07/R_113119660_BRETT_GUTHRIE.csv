1130033138,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. It seems theres no shortage of red flags regarding ObamaCare. The onesizefitsall health care law is proving to be disastrous for consumers. for employers and health care providers alike. Just last week. as my friend from North Carolina said. the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office warned: Because government officials have missed multiple key deadlines to set up the new health insurance exchanges. there is serious concern that the exchanges will not be ready in October. as scheduled. Employers and families across Kentucky have expressed serious concerns about meeting the requirements of the law and wondering if they will lose their coverage. be forced to choose different providers. or be saddled with enormous new costs. Now these individuals are left with even more uncertainty. When talking with business leaders across my district. I hear a barrage of questions and concerns. Small businesses. the backbone of our economy. are likely the hardest to be hit. Some local insurers say the law could put them out of business. One restaurant owner says it will be a challenge for the whole industry and many will be forced to lay off employees. Others simply say it will be difficult to insure all of their existing employees. A Gallup poll released last week showed that 41 percent of small businesses. the engine of our economic growth. have stopped hiring new employees because of ObamaCare. The same poll also showed that onefifth of those surveyed have reduced their workforce because of the law. Citing the uncertainty. these business leaders dont know what type of insurance programs they might be able to implement or if they will have to alter the shape of their workforce. The uncertainty seems likely to continue given the striking. but not surprising. report from the GAO. The Government Accountability Office warns that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services still has many duties to complete across core exchange functions. including eligibility and enrollment. With enrollment less than 4 months away. these missed deadlines will likely result in even more confusion as Americans are prepared to be placed into the exchanges. Its no wonder that this law is so wildly unpopular and individuals fear being placed in exchanges. But its not just families and businessowners who are left in the dark. Insurance companies dont know what to plan for when the exchanges open. and some are already fleeing the market. Aetna recently announced they will not participate in any statewide exchanges and they will exit the individual insurance market in California entirely. This mood can set a dangerous precedent: insurers not being willing to take the financial risk to meet the demands of ObamaCare and not participating in the exchanges altogether. With competition dwindling and individuals not knowing what they can expect in terms of coverage and cost. we are left with a very scary and unacceptable reality. There are simply too many unknowns in the law that completely overhauls our Nations health care system. This has led to unintended and negative consequences for employers. patients. and providers. This law is not the solution to our Nations health care problems. especially given the lack of information and tools available for implementation. Instead. we need to enact a patientcentered plan that lowers cost and ensures access for all Americans.
1130033140,We hear stories like that all the time when were home. We had one in the Energy and Commerce Committee when we had a gentleman who had a chain of restaurants hes developing in New England. which isnt where Im from. but he was before the committee. His testimony was that he had eight restaurants and planned to open a ninth. and he decided he had to wait because he has no idea what this health care bill is going to cost him when he has to provide health care for his employees. Of the net income of his eight restaurants. he estimatedif he could come up with it because. as we know. you still dont know exactly what the health care bill is going to look like. We know what the bill looks like. but what we dont know is whats really in it because the rules have not come out to say what you have to provide your employees. Its supposed to happen in October and be ready for January 1. So he has decided to just not open a restaurant until this gets implemented so he can then move forward. He said its going to take half of his net income. he has estimated. if whats in the rules comes out. If youve ever been in business. its something you always take home. but if youre growing a business. hoping to open a ninth. 10th. and so on and create a chain. the net income is what you put into the business to grow the business and move forward. Its half of his net income. according to his estimate and as best as he can estimate. because nobody knows the details of whats actually going to be required until. hopefully. we see it before October 1. Its just frustrating for him. Its frustrating for people. Its frustrating for employees. A guy stopped me in a store the other day. He just got a job at a retail store. He said. I was promised 40 hours. and I was just told Im going to be working 29 hours. Thats the new class of people working. particularly in retail. He was retired. and he was kind of looking for extra income. and hes going to be a 29er. Thats a term that we hear quite a bit. So dealing with health care is something we absolutely have to deal with but not dealing with it in the way of this bill. They didnt try to cut costs. and its actually implemented on top of the system even more. which is going to cost more. Employers are really concerned. not about being able to cover their employees. but theyre concerned about. Are they going to be able to afford to stay in business and even have employees? Thats the concern of most of them whom I hear talk about it. Im sure you hear the same. I know our good friend from Texas is now here on the floor. and Id like to give this back to my friend from North Carolina.
1130040984,I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding. I appreciate him letting me be a part of the Doctors Caucus for tonight. I dont want to pretend that I am a doctor. I certainly am not. but I appreciate the opportunity to be here. Mr. Speaker. to talk about the health care bill. Its nice that this has been organized so we can be here tonight to talk about a topic that is critical to the American people. and thats the crushing mandates in ObamaCare. As we know. last week. Mr. Speaker. the House considered two bills to relieve the American people of these mandates: the Authority for Mandate Delay Act would give large employers a reprieve from compliance with ObamaCares employer mandate until 2015. and the Fairness for American Families Act would grant individuals until 2015 to comply with the laws individual mandate. This onesizefitsall health care law is a train wreck. Its been quoted as a train wreck by members of the other party who voted for it in the other body. The administration has clearly realized its employer mandate will hinder businesses in their ability to grow and. just a few weeks ago. announced their decision to delay the implementation of this bill. I appreciate being here tonight because I come from a small business manufacturing background that provides health care at a low cost to our employees. I believe I understand the complexities that an employer faces in providing health insurance for their workers. This law encourages employers to cut workers hours. pare back their numbers of workers. and move workers from existing health insurance plans onto the exchange. Well. Im glad to see the administration is finally paying attention to the disastrous consequences of this law. It is disappointing that they expect families and small business owners to comply with the crushing mandates while they give big businesses a break. Improving access to health care and making it more affordable should be the goal and the outcome. I will continue to fight for full repeal of this law. but in the interim. Im glad the House moved last week to delay the implementation of the crushing mandates. Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding.
1130046312,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3092. and I yield myself such time as I may consume. As a father of three children. I cant imagine the horror if one of my children were missing or were in harms way. Just like any other parent. the thought is unthinkable and is one that I am thankful to have never experienced. My first exposure to the issues facing atrisk populations. such as those served by programs authorized by the underlying law. was as a cadet at West Point. which is just north of New York City. There was a shelter in New York City for runaway children. It was heartbreaking to hear the stories of these children. many of whom were abused or neglected and had no homes to return to. Oftentimes children who have run away from their homes are the most in danger of being killed or exploited. Approximately 80 percent of children reported missing are. in fact. categorized as ""endangered runaways."" These vulnerable kids deserve help. My bill. H.R. 3092. will reauthorize the Missing Childrens Assistance Act at current funding levels. Reauthorizing this critical law will ensure that the coordination of State and local law enforcement efforts to identify. locate. and recover missing. abducted. and sexually exploited children continues. We cannot afford to wait. The world around us. while often kind and beautiful. can also be cruel and ugly. but it is through the work of groups like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that resources are available to assist those in dire need. Chances are that youve seen a hotline come across your TV screen that is looking to collect information about a missing child but youve never thought about the infrastructure behind these efforts. This legislation seeks to reauthorize these critical programs and ensure no gap in access for the children. families. and communities in need. Since its founding in 1984. the center. while partnered with local law enforcement. has helped recover more than 188.000 missing children across the United States. April 9. 2014. marks the 30th anniversary of the Justice Departments awarding the first national clearinghouse grant to the center. Just 2 months after its creation. in June of 1984. President Reagan celebrated the official opening of the center at a White House ceremony. praising this model of publicprivate partnership. which has fulfilled his vision for three decades. I applaud the efforts of Chairman KLINE. Representative WALBERG. and my fellow committee members for understanding the importance of this legislation and in helping to move it forward. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3092 so we can continue to support these vital programs. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130058134,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman for yielding time to speak on an important issue that the Retail Investor Protection Act addresses. Employee Stock Ownership Plans provide good jobs and secure retirements in my home State. the Commonwealth of Kentucky. and across the Nation. In fact. ESOPs had fewer layoffs during the recession than other businesses. I have been joined by two dozen colleagues. from both sides of the aisle. on a bill to prevent the Department of Labor from imposing the fiduciary standard on appraisers of ESOP stock. IRS law today requires that ESOPs get an independent appraisal in order to determine the value of the stock. On the other hand. fiduciaries are. by definition. not independent. Any rule that would define ESOP appraisers as fiduciaries would create a conflict with the IRS regulations. and by creating conflicting duties for appraisers. any Department of Labor rules in this area would substantially increase the cost of ESOPs and. in fact. could regulate them out of existence. DOLs proposal would add costs to all parties and encourage needless litigation time and again. DOL has failed to sufficiently document the problems with ESOPs that they claim they are trying to remedy. This is simply another example of this administration overreaching and creating unnecessary burdens on business leaders for providing a great service to their employees. I am pleased to stand in support of the rule and the underlying bill today because. if enacted. this bill will help protect ESOPs in the near term. By barring DOL from finalizing a rule on fiduciaries until after the SEC has acted. this bill will provide some temporary protection for ESOPs and their appraisers. We must continue to defend business leaders and their employees from professional regulators whose illconsidered and counterproductive proposals are making it more difficult for hardworking Americans to achieve the American Dream. And we have been working with both sides of the aisle. and this party. the Republican Party. on this side of the aisle wants to make sure Americans have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. This bill does that. and. therefore. I support the rule and the underlying bill.
1130093142,I want to thank my friend from California for yielding. I rise today. Mr. Speaker. to talk about this devastating disease that impacts nearly every family in America: Alzheimers disease. According to the Alzheimers Association. Alzheimers is the costliest disease in America. with a direct cost of roughly $200 billionmost of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid. and accounts for 20 percent of Medicare spending. These numbers will only continue to increase. making the discovery of a cure. or a way to delay onset. critical to our health care economy. Across the United States. more than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimers today. In addition. the Alzheimers Association estimates that someone will develop this disease every 67 seconds. Eleven percent of Kentuckys seniors are currently living with Alzheimers. It is the sixthleading cause of death in the United States. But it is not the financial drain that is the most devastating. My family has been personally touched by Alzheimers. My great uncle suffered from the disease. I will never forget as a little boy hearing my grandmother talk to my mother about my uncle getting lost and trying to find his way home from the grocery store. Nobody really understood it. I remember as a young boy being confused about how this uncle I knew could be so confused and lose his way. I also experienced it in my family with my wifes grandfather. I will never forget when my wife and I went to visit him the first time he didnt recognize her. The devastation on her face that someone she loved so much didnt know who she was has still stuck with me today. This disease is emotionally wrenching for families who are impacted. Beyond the direct emotional and physical impact. family members serving as primary caregivers are stretched to their limits. Many spouses and grown children work full timejobs and then come home to care for their family member. Finding a cure or treatment for Alzheimers is of the utmost importance. I was pleased to introduce H.R. 4351 with my colleague. Representative PAUL TONKO of New York. H.R. 4351. the Alzheimers Accountability Act. seeks to ensure that the research and resources needed to find a cure for Alzheimers are properly conveyed to Congress. By receiving a professional judgment budget directly. Congress will be in a better position to see the needs and promise of researchers and use that information to make critical decisions. especially during difficult budgetary situations. Today. H.R. 4351 is bipartisan. My friend PAUL TONKO and myself filed this legislation. We have 80 cosponsors. There is also a Senate companion bill. and it is gaining momentum. Again. I want to thank my colleague for organizing this evening and for allowing me to be part of this effort to shine a light on Alzheimers disease. I would also like to encourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 4351. and help make fighting Alzheimers a top priority.
1130109899,Madam Chair. I rise today in support of H.R. 4984. the Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act. But first. I want to say thanks to my friend from Oregon. Congresswoman BONAMICI. for putting together a coalition of both sides where we can come together to address a problem that faces so many of the people who sent us here to represent them. And to the chairman. we are going to pass three or four bills this week in a bipartisan manner. The President signed a bill that passed this committee this week as well. It shows that he is putting together where we can find common ground to solve problems that really affect the people who sent us here to represent them. We appreciate him for that. But to address this bill: with the rising costs of attaining a college degree. many students need financial assistance to make that dream a reality. This bill will increase financial literacy by reforming the current guidelines to require annual counseling for student borrowers. In doing so. students will be empowered with the knowledge necessary to understand what they are borrowing. which financial options to draw from first. and the implication of their future debt load in repayment scenarios. A June 2014 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that less than 50 percent of survey respondents with student debt have what they consider a high loan literacy. Current Federal law only requires colleges and universities to provide financial counseling to student borrowers at the beginning of their studies. In short. these students get a quick snapshot of their loan obligations after they have already committed to the first years loans. and then again once they have accrued their entire loan burden. Making matters worse. these counseling sessions tend to be broad and not based on information specific to the borrower. Many of todays students do not have a clear picture of what their financial obligation will look like upon graduation. and arent necessarily given any opportunity to make decisions to alter that course. So will this bill make a difference? Well. we have an example. Indiana Universitybeing from Kentucky. I have to admit. Indiana University has begun a process of educating students annually prior to accepting their aid package for the following year. similar to our efforts in this bill. IU found that Federal undergraduate Stafford loan disbursements dropped by $31 million. or 11 percent. from the previous year. That is five times the decline in the national average. And they still were served in college. They just didnt take out too much excess debt. Through this bill. we hope to expand upon what institutions like Indiana University are doing and reform the current guidelines to require annual counseling for student borrowers. and ensure that students are empowered with the information they need to take control of their financial futures. I encourage my colleagues. and I appreciate the bipartisan support. and particularly my friend from Oregon. for working together. and I encourage my colleagues to support this meaningful legislation so we can arm students with the financial knowledge needed and help lower their debt burdens.

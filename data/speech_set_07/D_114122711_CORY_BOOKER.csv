1140003355,Mr. President. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation offered by Senators CORNYN and FRANKEN. the Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act. This critical piece of bipartisan legislation would promote alternatives to incarceration by helping identify and treat Americans suffering from mental illness. For far too long our criminal justice system has been a substitute for a mental health system. That practice is costly. wastes limited resources. and is contrary to evidencebased practices proven to make our communities safer. I thank Senators CORNYN and FRANKEN for their hard work on this important criminal justice reform bill. Today. law enforcement is illequipped and not properly trained to deal with individuals suffering from severe mental disorders whose conditions can cause them to commit crimes. The mentally ill are too often treated as common criminals and are not given access to the critical treatment they need. The Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act would save taxpayers money and effectively use limited resources by ensuring our prisons contain violent offenders as opposed to those who suffer from mental illnesses. When more than four of five inmates with a mental illness are not treated in jail. we waste resources by incarcerating them. This bill would make the public safer and save taxpayers money by ensuring that we continue to support vital programs. such as mental health courts. veterans courts. and crisis intervention teams. The bill would also improve public safety. Persons with complicated psychiatric problems that are thrown in jail can have their mental state deteriorate even further. If incarcerated without treatment. some mental illnesses can lead people to be a danger to the public once released. But with proper treatment. they can lead ordinary. lawabiding lives even absent incarceration. The bill would help to reduce jail overcrowding caused by warehousing people for lowlevel crimes. which often includes the mentally ill. For example. from 2009 to 2013 in New York City. about 400 people were sent to jail on at least 18 occasions each. That amounts to more than 10.000 jail admissions and 300.000 days in jail. In Chicago. from 2007 to 2011. 21 percent of the people sent to jails accounted for 50 percent of jail admissions. Because a significant number of people in jail are mentally ill. reducing recidivism for this population is critical. By supporting state and local efforts to identify and direct them to the appropriate mental health services. this bill would reduce recidivism and. in turn. help reduce jail overcrowding. The bill would also encourage the development of curricula on mental health conditions for police academies and orientations. Finally. the legislation would include new grant accountability measures and emphasize the implantation of evidencebased practices. It is time we address mental illness in our country through treatment. not incarceration. Passing this commonsense bill would reduce recidivism. save taxpayer money. and make our communities safer. That is why I support this bill and I urge its speedy passage.
1140011302,Mr. President. I rise today in partnership with Senator THAD COCHRAN from Mississippi having just submitted a resolution recognizing and celebrating Black History Month here in the United States of America. I wish to take a few moments before that to address an issue that very poignantly has been anguishing my heart for my entire life. From the time I was growing up in the small town of Harrington Park. NJ. through my career in school and college. this has been grieving my heart. It has been grieving my heart since I started working in a predominantly minority citya city I loveNewark. NJ. I bring this up in the context of a previous speech I gave about our broken criminal justice system that makes us singular. among all of humanity on planet Earth. for the amount of our population that we incarcerate. We have 5 percent of the globes population but about 25 percent of all of the globes imprisoned people. This explosion is not consistent with our history. In fact. it is inconsistent with our history. It is incongruent with our values. To be very specific. the explosion of our prison population is because of the war on drugs. The bottom line is that there were fewer people incarcerated in 1980 for any reason than there are today in prison and jails for drug offenses alone. Let me say that again. we have more people incarcerated today. either in prisons or in jails. just for drug crimes than all of the people incarcerated in the year 1980. In fact. due to this drug war our Federal prison population has exploded about 800 percent. In the context of what I am about to talk about in this resolution recognizing AfricanAmerican history. I wish to particularly point to today this grievous reality that our war on drugs has disproportionately affected African Americans. Latinos. minorities. and the poor in general. It is painful for me to have seen in my lifetime. in the town I grew up in or at Stanford or Yale. many of my friends using drugs such as marijuana. many of them buying drugs such as marijuana. and many of them selling drugs such as marijuana. But the reality is the justice system they experienced for breaking the law was very different than the justice system I saw in Newark. NJ. The reality is we dont have a system of equal justice under law. but a system that disproportionately affects minorities in a way that is stunning and an affront to our nations values. Arrest rates for drug use have a disparate impact on people of color. There is no questioning that. This is unacceptable. When it comes to people who break the law in America. there is actually no difference between blacks and whites who have committed drug crimesnone whatsoever. but African Americans. for example. when it comes to marijuana. are arrested at 3.7 times the rate that whites are in this country. While their usages were similar in Newark or Stanford. law enforcement has arrested and incarcerated far more minorities living in urban communities than whites living in suburban communities. Between 2007 and 2009. drug sentences for African American men were longer than those for white men. Drug sentences for black men were 13.1 percent longer for the same crime than those for white men. So not only are more African Americans and Latinos and people of color being targeted and arrested at higher rates than whites for the same crimes. but they are also getting and serving longer sentences. Human Rights Watch put it simply. They found that even though the majority of illegal drug users and dealers nationwide are white. threequarters of all people imprisoned for drug offenses are minorities. This should call out to the conscience of everyone in our country. We believe fundamentally. at the core of our American values. in this ideal of equal justice under the law. The punishing thing about this is that not only are arrest rates higher. not only are they receiving longer sentences. but when we get such a disproportionate amount of people being arrested and incarcerated. the collateral consequences which they see at the end of the system become even more punishing on those communities. We now have cities in America that for certain age demographics. almost 50 percent of African American men have been arrested. and over 40 percent of Latino men have been arrested. And what that means is that once someone has a felony conviction for the nonviolent use of drugs. ones ability to go to college. to get a Pell grant. to get a job. and even to get many business licenses. is undermined. Right now we see this punishing impact destroying many communities. Instead of empowering people to succeed. we are getting people trapped in our criminal justice system. Instead of the solid rock of success. people are being sucked into the quicksand of a broken criminal justice system. For example. the blacks and Latinos in the United States are 29 percent of the population but make up almost 60 percent of the prison population. In New Jersey. blacks and Latinos are 32 percent of the total State population. but blacks and Latinos make up 81 percent of our prison population. An often overlooked group in this discussion on the disproportionate impact on minorities is Native Americans. For instance. in North Dakota. Native Americans make up 5 percent of the total State population but 29 percent of the prison population. These numbers. again. go against the truth of who we are as a country. So at this moment. when we are celebrating our history. when blacks and whites and Christians. Jews. and Muslims come together to advance our Nationindeed. I stand here today because of the collective conviction of this country to live up to its values and ideals that all of us are created equal under God and that all of us should have an equal opportunity to succeed and be seen equally by our government. It is at this moment that I say we can and must do better. In fact. many States. including red States. led by Republicans. are showing that there is a different way. For example. States such as Texas. Georgia. and North Carolina are leading on this issue. Texas is known for its law and order. but it has made tremendous strides in adopting policies that have decreased its prison population and positively affected minorities in the State. In fact. the Governor of Georgia continually talks about the fact that he has been able to lower his black male incarceration rate by about 20 percent over the past 5 years. So as I prepare to join with the great Senator from Mississippi. I just want to say from the bottom of my heart that it is time to reform our legal system to make it truly a justice system. We want it so that everyone under the law faces equal treatment and so that we empower our entire community in America to be successful. not tie them up unnecessarily when even though they have paid the price for their crime. Punishment should not haunt someone for the rest of their existence. I remember these words spoken by the great Langston Hughes. one of our great American poets. an AfricanAmerican man who once said: There is a dream in this land with its back against the wall. to save this dream for one. we must save it for all. This is the dream of America. We can do better. Indeed. many communities are committing themselves to creating a justice system which we can be proud of. We know in the SenateMembers on both sides of the political aisle. whether it is Senator LEE or Senator DURBIN or whether it is Senator CORNYN or Senator WHITEHOUSEthat together we can evidence these values. With that. I recognize and yield for a moment to a friend and an ally. the Senator from Mississippi. THAD COCHRAN.
1140038932,"Mr. President. I support the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. an important step on the road to protecting the right to vote for all Americans. It responds to a recent Supreme Court ruling that rolled back critical voting protections that had proven effective for decades and that Congress had reauthorized several times. This landmark legislation would reaffirm the importance of the vote as a pillar of our democracy and restore a powerful shield to combat voting discrimination. I thank Senator LEAHY for his leadership on this bill. and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of a bill that protects access to the ballot box for all American citizens. Mr. President. 50 years ago. President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965. legislation that he called ""a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any battlefield."" At the time he signed the bill into law. millions of Americans were denied the right to vote based on the color of their skin. President Johnson called this ""a clear and simple wrong"" and acknowledged that the Voting Rights Acts ""only purpose is to right that wrong."" With the stroke of a pen. President Johnson enacted a bill that threw open the doors of democracy for all Americans and promised that the precious right to vote would be protected. The United States has had a long and bumpy road to even achieving that promise. In the decades before the Voting Rights Act. Blacks had been denied their right to vote and participate in the political process. They were harassed and intimidated from going to the polls. Ordinary Americans who marched for themselves or their fellow citizens to exercise the right to vote were beaten. arrested. jailed. or even murdered. On June 21. 1964. 51 years ago this week. three civil rights workerstwo white young men from New York City and one black Mississippianwere killed in Mississippi by the Ku Klux Klan simply for trying to help register African Americans to vote. Their sacrifice inspired countless others to fight to make our union more perfect. Even in my home State. in Cherry Hill. NJ. stands a monument that pays tribute to these three civil rights workers who died in the struggle for equality. Few things made African Americans feel less equal in America than being deprived of the basic right of citizenshipthe right to vote. They even suffered the indignity of having to count beans in a barrel. take a literacy test. pay a poll tax. or recite from memory the preamble to the Constitution without a glitch just to cast a ballot. As a result of disenfranchising tactics. no Black southerner served in Congress from 1901 to 1973. For decades. the promises of liberty and justice for all embedded in our national charter were simply words on paper. But the Voting Rights Act changed America. By the end of 1966. 1 year after it became law. only 4 out of the traditional 13 Southern States had less than 50 percent of African Americans registered to vote. In Mississippi alone. Black voter turnout increased from 6 percent in 1964 to 59 percent in 1969. Throughout the South. and indeed our entire country. Blacks and Latinos were elected into public office in significant numbers. The Voting Rights Act has been the most powerful tool to defend minorities voting rights. The law established new ground to curb voter discrimination by requiring Federal Ipreclearance""-that is. Federal reviewof voting law changes in areas with histories of discrimination. And therein lies its power. There is no remedy for citizens after an unfair election has occurred. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was the only Federal remedy that could prevent unfair elections before they took place. The lesson of history is clearsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act has made America live up to its promises of liberty and justice by ensuring that every citizen has an equal opportunity to participate in our democracy. That is why preserving the Voting Rights Act is so important. That is why Presidents Reagan. Ford. and Nixon had signed prior reauthorizations of the act. That is why in successive Congressesboth Republicans and Democratsrepeatedly reauthorized section In 2006. Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act by an overwhelming bipartisan margin. The law was reauthorized 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House and President George W. Bush signed the bill into law. It was a testament to the fact that men and women from across the aisle could come together to protect what is most important to our democracy. the right to vote. A right the Supreme Court has called fundamental because it is preservative of all other rights. Congress developed an expansive record during its 2006 reauthorization that justified the need for section 5 as a necessary and effective tool to protect minority voters. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees found ample evidence that. even after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. States and localities continued to engage in overt and subtle tactics that discriminated against minority voters. Two years ago. a narrowly split and deeply divided Supreme Court disregarded extensive findings of Congress and gutted the Voting Rights Act. In a case known as Shelby County v. Holder. five Justices on the Supreme Court put the Voting Rights Act on life support by striking down the formula by which Congress determines which States and localities are subject to preclearance. That 2013 decision has nullified the ability of the Federal Government to use the preclearance requirement. Section 5 has protected constitutional guarantees against discrimination in voting even when civil rights laws tried for over 100 years to achieve the success of the Voting Rights Act. The Court reached its decision despite Congress finding an overwhelming record of contemporary voting discrimination. Even the Chief Justice wrote. ""voting discrimination still exists: no one doubts that."" Yet. the Shelby County decision rested on a flawed logic that the Voting Rights Act was a victim of its own success. Justice Ginsburgs dissent noted a ""catch22"" in the majoritys logic. She said: If the statute was working. there would be less evidence of discrimination. so opponents might argue that Congress should not be allowed to renew the statute. In contrast. if the statute was not working. there would be plenty of evidence of discrimination. but scant reason to renew a failed regulatory regime. I agree with Justice Ginsburg that the Courts decision to strike down section 5 ""when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because youre not getting wet."" Even in the aftermath of Shelby County. States continued to enact laws that make it harder for American citizens to cast their ballot. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. the Nations foremost civil rights coalition. released a report last year entitled ""The Persistent Challenges of Voting Discrimination."" That report documented 148 voting rights violations in America since 2000. Because each voting rights violation often impacts thousands of voters. the report underscored that the impact of racial discrimination in voting is much more profound than the nearly 150 documented violations suggest. New State laws erect barriers to voting. which restrict voter registration drives. eliminate sameday voter registration. reduce the early voting period. and require photo identification and proof of citizenship to vote. So far. 32 States have passed laws requiring voters to show some kind of identification at the polls. which often have a disparate impact on minority and lowincome voters. The Voting Rights Advancement Act would help prevent voting practices that are likely to be discriminatory before they cause harm. It would create a new nationwide coverage formula requiring States and localities to obtain preclearance for voting changes that have historically been found to be discriminatory. It would enhance the authority of courts to order a preclearance remedy. require greater transparency regarding voting changes. and clarify the Attorney Generals authority to send Federal observers to monitor elections across the country. In his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. said. ""When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir."" The Voting Rights Act has been one of our most important tools to fulfill that promise and protect voters against discrimination. Congress now has a historic opportunity to ensure that the critical provisions in that law are restored and strengthened. Now is the time to recommit ourselves to the cause of justice. Now is the time to safeguard our democratic values. Now is the time to protect the progress so many Americans worked so hard to establish. I urge all Senators to support this bill that would combat voter discrimination and breathe life back into the Voting Rights Act."
1140049959,Mr. President. I wish to celebrate the remarkable life and accomplishments of a great American and New Jerseyan. Lieutenant Calvin Spann. As a boy in Rutherford. NJ. Calvin was amazed by the miracle of flight. watching as planes took off from nearby Teterboro Airport. This early passion for aviation. coupled with a determination to prove that as an African American he was as capable as anyone to fly a plane. would eventually motivate him to take a courageous risk as a young man. Lieutenant Spann enlisted in the Army Air Forces at a time when all branches of the U.S. military were still segregated. He left home behind when he was assigned by the Army to attend Flight Training School at Tuskegee University in Alabama. In earning his wings at Tuskegee and serving in Europe during World War II as a member of the 100th Fighter Squadron and 332nd Fighter Group. Lieutenant Spann proved not only that he could fly but that he could do it with unusual bravery and skill. Lieutenant Spann flew 26 missions during the war. including what was at the time the longest bomber escort mission in history. Lieutenant Spann received numerous awards for his military service. includingmuch too latea Congressional Gold Medal in 2006. The distinction with which Lieutenant Spann and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen served paved the way for President Truman to desegregate the U.S. military in 1948. Lieutenant Spann. unfortunately. returned home at a time in which racial discrimination still outweighed his distinguished military service. Trying to build flight hours in an effort to remain a pilot. he was denied access to planes at Teterboro. and commercial airlines would not hire him simply because of his race. With characteristic resilience. he earned a living for himself and his family as a factory supervisor. sales representative. restaurant owner. and real estate broker. Fifty years later. he was inducted into the New Jersey Aviation Hall of Fame. Lieutenant Spann pushed against a system that held all Americans back by denying some individuals the ability to contribute their talent and passion simply because of their identity. The United States of America is a better. stronger country because of Lieutenant Spann. For having the courage to pursue his dreams in the face of tremendous obstacles and at great risk to himself. Lieutenant Spann deserves our deepest respect and gratitude. May he rest in peace.
1140058876,Mr. President. today I would like to recognize Rev. Dr. M. William Howard. Jr.. pastor of Newarks Bethany Baptist Church. Dr. Howard has spent many decades leading the charge for change. fueled by his personal mission to utilize his faith to transform the human condition. From his Georgia roots to his work at Bethany Baptist. Dr. Howard has shown an extraordinary commitment to serving others. His work outside of the church has spanned the realms of human rights. international affairs. domestic policy. and education. In his role over the last 15 years as pastor of Bethany Baptist Church. he has worked tirelessly to expand outreach to the community as a whole. Since his first position as a youth leader conducting some of the earliest voter outreach efforts in southwest Georgia. Dr. Howard has been a beacon of light across the globe. bridging the worlds of faith and political activism. He has consistently taken on leadership roles. serving as moderator of the Programme to Combat Racism of the World Council of Churches. president of the National Council of Churches. and president of the American Committee on Africa. Through these posts. Dr. Howard has provided a powerful example of our Nations commitment to human rights and equality. In ministering to U.S. personnel held hostage in Iran in 1979 and working for the release of U.S. Navy pilot Robert 0. Goodman. Dr. Howard was a quiet but powerful force for faith and peace. Dr. Howards record of service and leadership domestically is equally impressive. Serving as president of New York Theological Seminary. he demonstrated the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to community development by implementing joint programs in social work and urban education. He has been a board member for such organizations as the National Urban League. the Childrens Defense Fund. and the Rutgers University Board of Governors. Under his leadership. the New Jersey Death Penalty Study Commission was instrumental in New Jersey becoming the first State to abolish the death penalty since 1976. Finally. Dr. Howards impact on the city of Newark has been remarkable. As pastor of Bethany. Dr. Howard quickly established Bethany Cares. Inc.. and through this outreach corporation. the church has actively transcended its congregation walls to serve the community at large. Such transformative work has played an integral part in strengthening the development of New Jerseys largest city. After 15 years of devoted service as pastor of Bethany Baptist Church. Dr. Howard will be retiring. It is an honor to formally recognize Dr. Howard for his unwavering commitment to creating a better world.*
1140068639,Mr. President. I wish to speak about the Every Student Succeeds Act that the President signed into law today. I want to first congratulate my colleagues Senator PATTY MURRAY and Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER. who have effectively been able to guide this bill through the Senate. It has been an honor to watch and participate in this processa process that has served as a great example of the way the Senate is supposed to work. When the original Senate version of the Every Child Achieves Act came to the floor for a vote on July 22. 2015. I could not support it because. while it made necessary changes to the No Child Left Behind law. I could not in good conscience support a bill that fell short of investing in the potential and promise of all of our children. especially New Jerseys most vulnerable students. I stood resolute in the belief that if Congress was truly going to invest in our children and grandchildrens future. it was vital that any legislation passed provide support. access. and opportunity to equip the next generation to succeed. regardless of their socioeconomic status. These needs were particularly poignant given the historic context of the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act as a civil rights bill. Created the same year as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and just 11 years after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. President Lyndon B. Johnsons original piece of legislation intended to address the gaping gulf in the quality of education received by lowincome students in an intensely segregated country. Indeed. this piece of legislation was a vital tool in President Johnsons arsenal on the War on Poverty. It is undeniable that education is a cornerstone of the American Dream to achieve success and financial security. We do our Nation and our children a disservice if we do not do everything in our power to ensure that President Johnsons arsenal is not only maintained. but honed and replenished with robust provisions to fight an evolving battle for educational equity in our schools. Although I did not vote for the original Senate version of ESEA that passed the Senate in July. I am glad to see a conference report. the Every Student Succeeds Act. ESSA. that takes elements from both the House and Senate bill and ultimately is a better bill for all children. teachers. and parents in our country. Chief among provisions that I believed were problematic was the lack of accountability measures to ensure Americas most vulnerable students have access to a quality education. With regards to accountability. it was critical not to be overly prescriptive while still acknowledging an intense need to identify and ask schools and districts to figure out specific plans to turn things around in the lowest performing schools and high schools who fail to graduate onethird of their students. It is also critical to identify where there are groups of students who are consistently performing worse than their peers. I do not believe these changes should come from Washington. Local teachers. principals. and parents are best equipped to know how best to turn around a failing school. and this bill gives them the arsenal to do so. I believe the new accountability provisions empower local leaders. with State and Federal guidance. to pursue the improvement strategies best suited to their local needs. These accountability measures are vital if we are to guarantee that the ideals our students pledge allegiance to every day. justice and liberty for all. are manifest in the education we provide for our youngest Americans. With this goal in mind. I am also pleased that ESSA includes my amendment to support homeless and foster youth. by ensuring educators and the public are aware of how foster and homeless children and youth are performing on critical elements compared to their peers by adding reporting for these groups on graduation rates to the State and school district report cards. The role of teachers is also prioritized in ESSA. and I was especially proud to see the amendment I authored that helps support teachers by asking school districts to identify opportunities to make working conditions better and more sustainable. With these improvements made and the spirit of the bill as an important piece of civil rights legislation maintained. I wholeheartedly support the reconciled version that has passed the House and Senate and that was signed by the President today.
1140082853,Mr. President. today the Senate Committee on Commerce. Science. and Transportation approved legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. I applaud the work of my colleagues Senators THUNE and NELSON. Their leadership on this important legislation was critical. I would like to make clear that. while we took important steps forward with this legislation. more work remains to be done to ensure the United States remains a global leader in aviation. safety. and innovation. Going into this year. many on the Commerce Committee. along with Department of Transportation Secretary Foxx and FAA Administrator Huerta and key stakeholders. aimed high on FAA reauthorization. We aimed high because there are big ideas we need to address when it comes to aviation in this country. From the current state and financing of our airport infrastructure. to completing NextGen implementation. to accelerating commercial use of UAS technology. to new proposals about our Air Traffic Control system. there were a lot of innovative ideas on the table. and while we made strides on some. more work remains to be done. There is widespread agreement that the status quo is not acceptable. and I was pleased to join my colleagues in taking this initial step forward to reauthorize the FAA for the upcoming 18 months. Furthermore. I am pleased that I was able to put forth amendments that were included in this bill to ensure adequate staffing levels at the Newark air traffic control tower. In addition. we were able to secure a muchneeded study of the New York and New Jersey airports. which cover the busiest airspace in the country. Findings from this study will enable us to make informed decisions about how best to address this staffing problem in the future. I am also concerned about staffing levels at the Transportation Security Administration. TSA. There have been incredibly long delays at Newark airport because of inadequate staffing of TSA agents at our airport. Safety is absolutely paramount in our airports. It is my hope that we can achieve both topnotch security and an efficient. reliable process for travelers using our airports. Increased staffing should help us achieve that goal. In this reauthorization. I was pleased to work with Senator CANTWELL to increase competition in the Newark airport with the hope that increased competition and opening up more flight slots at the airport may yield more options and price points for consumers. But I must stress that these changes cannot move forward without ensuring the airport is equipped to handle more traffic and passengers. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this issue and am excited by the opportunities this could bring for my constituents. We also made progress on furthering the integration of unmanned aerial systems. UAS. or drones into our airspace in our legislation. This technology is literally taking off around the world. It has the power to enhance search and rescue. deliver humanitarian aid. improve agriculture practices. and newsgathering. I introduced the Commercial UAS Modernization Act to help advance this technology and was pleased to see many of our ideas incorporated in this legislation. I worked with committee leadership to further advance a microUAS rule. which would allow U.S. businesses to fly microdrones under 4.4 pounds responsibly and safely. Advancing microUAS use will bring tremendous innovations and new efficiencies across the country and will keep the United States on par with other developed nations who have been making great strides ahead of us in utilizing this technology. From improving research to providing unmanned bridge inspections. the benefits of this technology are truly limitless. UAS has the power to save lives and create new efficiencies across industries. I am excited to see what the innovators and entrepreneurs come up with as a result of our rule which sets forth clear safety guidelines for responsible operation. Finally. I want to address a couple of amendments that I put forth that were not included in this legislation and express my sincere hope that the chairman and ranking member will work with me before this bill gets to floor. I introduced two amendments to the bill that would address disadvantaged business enterprise. or DBE. projects. The goal of this program. of course. is to promote equity and inclusion in federally financed transportation projects. While neither of these amendments were incorporated into this legislation as of yet. I am confident that we can work together to advance this important policy goal. One amendment would ensure conformance of the DOT size standard for small businesses to the metric defined by the Small Business Administration. This update will enable more minority and womenowned businesses to compete for infrastructure work. The second amendment sets goals for minority and womenowned businesses on projects financed only by passenger facility charges. or PFCs. I ask the chairman and ranking member to continue to work with me as this bill goes to the floor to advance these two important goals. Thank you.
1140095720,"Mr. President. I rise today to join my colleagues in supporting the conflictofinterest rule that was recently finalized by the Department of Labor. This is a fair and balanced rule that protects our Nations retirees and savers. In fact. it is a rule that makes sure that in the midst of a retirement crisis in this country. where people are having a harder and harder time making sure that after working a lifetime they have the money they need to retireit is bringing common sense back to that process. I firmly believe that the conflictofinterest rule should not be a partisan issue. That is because this rule comes down to those fundamental ideas that really know no party bounds. Again. the idea for me is about honor and common sense. By honor. I mean the idea that we are a country that believes every American deserves a fair opportunity to succeed. Fairness is at the core of our Nations idealsthis idea that we are all bound to do what we can to identify and change systems that stack the deck against hardworking families that play by the rules. This body and its history have done so much to level the playing field and make sure that we have a free market and a fair market. It is because we as a nation value dignity and stand against those who seek to exploit or take advantage of others. In fact. we understand that we have an obligation to our country men and women. We have an obligation to each other to ensure that there is a level playing field that no one can take advantage of or exploit. We participate in. abide by. and are meant to benefit from this social contract and understand that a social contract and a vibrant economy are not mutually exclusive. Actually. they reinforce one another. These principles make America exceptional. They empower and embolden our freemarket economy. They generate strength and security for more families. They ensure abundance and allow us to strive for ideals of life. liberty. and the ability to pursue happiness. So I believe we are honor bound to uphold these principles. to ensure fairness and opportunity for all. We also must understand that fairness is a key ingredient in broadbased economic growth and strength. When I talk about common sense. I mean people have a reasonable expectation. in a free market. to be treated fairly and justly. especially in those areas that are most critical to their lives. It is rational. therefore. and just common sense. for us to insist that when we are treated by a doctor. that the doctor is going to place the interest of our health over their own financial interests. It is understandable that when we go to see a doctor. what is paramount is what is in our best interest. It is also understandable that we have that standard when it comes to the law. and. when we seek legal counsel. we are right to expect our lawyers to act in our best interest. That is the standard for doctors and for lawyers. for our health and wellbeing and for those legal decisions that will affect our lives profoundly. When we seek advice on an issue as serious as our health. our livelihoods. and our finances. we expect to be treated with the highest standards of care. and those professionalsthose lawyers or doctorsshouldnt in any way be inhibited in their ability to make a livelihood. Indeed. in many cases. they should flourish. While the vast majority in the financial industry are strong advisers who put the interests of their clients first. the challenge we have right now is that unlike doctors and lawyers. those financial advisers are not required to put the interest of their clients at the high level of a fiduciary standard. As a result of not having that same high standard of care as doctors and lawyers. there are some within that industry who actually take advantage of families trying to plan for their retirement. A large money market manager recently said: ""As active equity managers we have all been on the hook lately to justify our value proposition. And we should be. since the facts clearly show that as an industry. we have not consistently provided the performance that investors deserve."" Here are folks who have incredible financial knowledge. sophistication. and acumen talking to everyday Americans and putting forth this idea that they are going to help them retire with security. but they have no obligation to do what is in their best interest. to uphold the highest standard of care. That is problematic. and industry leaders understand that. They understand we cannot allow space for those who might seek to exploit families. struggling to retire. for their own financial interest. It is this idea that is at the root of the conflictofinterest rulethe idea that hardworking Americans saving for retirement deserve to be treated with fairness. with honor. and with a mutual obligation Americans should have toward each other. so that if they seek advice from a financial adviser. they deserve to get advice that prioritizes their needs above all others. This is about fairness. This is about common sense. I was proud to stand with the Secretary of Labor. Secretary Perez. and my colleagues Senator WARREN and Senator MURRAY when this final rule was announced. I am proud that prior to that. the rule went through a very lengthy and diligent process that allowed for robust feedback from all types of stakeholders. Throughout the rulemaking process. the Department of Labor demonstrated patience and inclusiveness of all perspectives. and. most of all. an unyielding commitment to protecting our Nations workers and retireesprotecting the bedrock of our country and the very idea of the middle class. that if you work hard and play by the rules. you can retire with security and dignity. The result of all the work of the Department of Labor and their commitment to this ideal is a fair and balanced rule based on the ideas of common sense and honor. The fact is. for so many Americans. it could not come at a more important time. In fact. it could not come at a more urgent time. We have a retirement crisis in our country. So many people are working harder and harder but are finding themselves with more month at the end of their money than money at the end of their month. Many people are finding it harder and harder to save for retirement. In fact. right now one in three arent saving for retirement. The Federal Reserve found that a whopping 47 percent of Americans dont have the savings to even cover a $400 emergency expense. Since the financial crisis. retirement readiness for the average American has actually decreased. Families are seeing greater challenges now in securing their own future. They are seeing greater difficulties securing the American dream of being able to work hard. play by the rules. and retire with dignity and security. I know this personally. and my office does because we hear from constituents all the time about their real stories. not just of the difficulties of planning for retirement but in dealing with a financial industry that often takes advantage of their clients. Last year I heard from one of my constituents in Lakewood who wrote to tell me about his mother. After losing her husband. she went to seek advice from a financial adviser to help her sort out her finances and plan for her retirement. She put her trust and her livelihood in the hands of this adviser. but the conflicted advice she received ended up costing her tens of thousands of dollars. Saving for retirement is stressful. At kitchen tables in every town. every city across the country. families are struggling to figure out how best to save for retirement. and here was an adviser who provided conflicted advice. costing my resident in Lakewood tens of thousands of dollars because they trusted and relied on the fact that the advice the financial retirement adviser was giving them was in their best interest. This is wrong. and it is unfair. Especially for those Americans who dont have much to begin with. the way they manage their retirement savings means so much. Huge gulfs continue to persist in retirement savings between men and women. the poor and the wealthy. and minority families and their White peers. This is a problem for all Americans. from all different backgrounds. It is a crisis in our country. For so many Americans. in regard to this rule. there is so much at stake. Good advice from a retirement adviser can make a world of difference. In fact. it can be the difference between security and financial crisis. It can be the difference between retiring with ease versus retiring with stress and dependence. That is why the advice of a trusted retirement professional is so important. There are many good actors in this space who know that increased transparency. increased accountability. and the idea of profitability dont need to be mutually exclusive. In fact. there are people making extraordinary livings in this space by doing the right thing for their clients. Honest. hardworking brokers know that updating the standards expected of retirement advisers is common sense. fair. and it actually helps America as a whole become stronger. That is why industry leaders are already making changes to prepare for this rules implementation and why the CEO of a major money management firm recently implored his industry colleagues by saying: Lets not lose sight of why clients engage us in the first place: to help them save the money they need to buy a house. send their kids to college. retire comfortably and meet any other longterm financial goals they have. This CEO is 100 percent right. and I am happy many companies are beginning to ensure their retirement plans make the most of their employees savings. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report. the administrative cost of retirement plans fell to their lowest level in a decade in 2015 and with this rule. they will continue to fall. The needle is moving in the right direction. To attempt to block this rule now would be a step backward. and it would send a message to hardworking Americans and retirees that they simply dont matter enough to this body. that this body cares more about special interests than hardworking families. It cares more about financial advisers on Wall Street and their ability to exploit middleclass Americans than it does those middleclass Americans who believe in the American dream that is being put at risk. To not support this rule would be to roll back what we all know. that we can create a winwin and a fair economy that doesnt exploit people who are vulnerable but uplifts them. where both financial adviser and middleclass retirees can have success. I know men and women in our countryand many who serve herewho know and understand the challenges of planning for retirement. Look. on the day this rule was announced earlier this year. I understood some people would try to fight this. and I turned to the folks listening and said: Look. this fight is not over. We are going to have to continue. Let us as a nation fight for what is right. not for the special interests of the wealthy few. Lets not allow people to feast upon the retirement savings from the hard work of others. but lets fight to affirm the middleclass dream in America. Lets fight to make sure we are doing right by folks. Lets create a level playing field. This is a fight for people like the constituent of mine who not only lost her husband but too much of her savings and now is trying to pick up the pieces. This fight is not over for hardworking families across this country who are diligently saving for retirement and for whom these hidden fees. unfortunately. threaten to undermine decades of hard work. These hidden fees are insidious. These hidden fees allow some advisers to exploit people for their own enrichment. These hidden fees are unAmerican. We must continue to make sure those hardworking advisers who provide exemplary levels of service. who prioritize their clients interests. are the ones being elevated in this fairer system and not being maligned by those few bad actors who feast upon the savings of other people. This fight has to be about what it means to be an American. That is what this body did when it passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 40 years ago. We believed in the idea that America is a place where if you work hard and you play by the rules. you can retire with dignity and dont have to worry that your doctor or your lawyer or your financial adviser will exploit you and thrust you into insecurity or worse. This is what we must do in this body now. In the spirit of past actions. we must put the interest of our middleclass constituents first. plain and simple. This rule is fair. This rule is balanced. This rule helps our free market economy. This rule ensures that the highest standard will be applied to something as precious and fundamental as our retirement savings. It preserves honor in this business. It preserves honor for America. The needle has already moved forward. We cannot afford to go back. Mr. President. I yield the floor."
1140101269,Mr. President. I said one more question. but I have two more questions. This is sort of a progression. My friend is here today because of a commitment Senator MURPHY made in his maiden speech in the U.S. Senatea consistent sense of belief that my friend will never give up until we have commonsense gun safety in America. After the grievous act that we saw in Florida. where 49 innocent people were slaughtered. Senator MURPHY. Senator BLUMENTHAL. countless Senators. and Iat least half of our caucus has come down here and said the same thing: Enough is enough. We cant let business as usual happen. No. 2. and the reason my friend stood up and has been holding the floor for 91/2 hours. has been in order to say: Hey. the terrorist loophole should be closed. There is one more element to this progressionan indefatigable Senator with a noncontroversial element in terms of the terrorist loophole. but now there is this other piece. which is just common sense. and I want to take that one step and ask that my friend go a little deeper with it. That last step is this: If you just have the terrorist loophole closed but dont have universal background checksin other words. if you close the terrorist loophole so that anybody who goes to a Federal firearm licensed dealer or goes to a NICS check. that stops that terrorist. but if you still have these Internet and private sales. that terrorist. who probably will not even go to that Federal arms licensee. will go to the back doors that are still wide open for people to get guns. So what the Senator from Connecticut is saying is that he is not giving up. No. 2. 70plus percent of NRA members agree with me on what I am asking for. This last step. where the majority of gun owners in America agree. why is it important to also make sure that if we want to stop terrorists from doing what they did in Orlandoif we do nothing. it may happen again. God forbid. Why is this universal background check element the second thing my friend is standing up for today. along with his colleagues?

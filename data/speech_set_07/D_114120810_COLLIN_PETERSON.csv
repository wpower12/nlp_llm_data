1140032722,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I oppose this legislation because it will roll back important financial regulations and interfere with the CFTCs ability to do its work. I am very concerned that H.R. 2289 will open the door to the types of things that created the financial mess that we are just beginning to get ourselves out of. So let me be clear. I dont have an issue with many of the provisions that are relevant to enduser protections. In fact. the DoddFrank bill that I helped write states very clearly that end users were not the problem. and the CFTC has been very receptive to that fact and taken that into consideration as they have adopted rules. One of my biggest concerns in this bill is the new costbenefit analysis. This is. in my opinion. all cost and not a lot of benefit unless you are one of the nine big banks who. as far as I am concerned. have not learned a thing from the financial crisis. This not only adds an unneeded layer of government bureaucracy. it opens the doors to lawsuits from major banks seeking to delay or completely derail CFTC rulemakings. I also have serious concerns with the trouble that will be caused by section 314. the crossborder section of this bill. Chairman Massad has been negotiating extensively and in good faith with our European counterparts to harmonize their rules with ours. I have talked to the Chairman a number of times about this. and he has assured me and it has been independently verified that they are 85 percent of the way to getting a deal in this area. This provision in my opinion will cut the negotiators off at the knees. I am worried that this provision will take us back to where we were and what was happening prior to the financial crash. The big banks at that time that have offices both in London and New York were playing us against each other. getting the United States to water down rules by threatening to move their business elsewhere and vice versa. and that was verified on committee trips that we took over to Europe and in discussions with their regulators. The costbenefit requirement. as I said. along with the crossborder rule. will cost $45 billion over 5 years. according to the CBO. And again. this is a cost that I believe doesnt have a whole lot of benefit. H.R. 2289 has a whole host of other problems. The bill unravels the transparency provided by DoddFrank. slows down CFTC staff ability to respond to industry concerns. mucks up the Commissions ability to issue guidance if rules need updating or clarification. and relitigates a disagreement between former commissioners that has no place in this bill. This is a bad bill that cant be fixed. It should be defeated by the House. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2289. Mr. Chairman. I have a statement from the administration where they have indicated their displeasure with this bill and the fact that they are going to recommend vetoing it. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140032742,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. With all due respect to my colleagues who have been claiming that the bill does this and does that. there are a lot of groups that have a different view. There are over twohundredandsome groups that disagree with how the impacts of these bills were going to affect the markets. including the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. who are the people who actually have to administer this law. And we have a letter from the chairman that has a completely different point of view than Mr. SCOTT has and others in terms of how this will impact the situation. According to the chairman. you know. he is opposed to this. He says: ""I believe that many of the provisions in this bill before the committee are either unnecessary or impose requirements on the Commission that would make it harder to fulfill their mission. The bill limits the agencys ability to respond quickly to both market events and market participants. It will make it more difficult for us to make adjustments to rules and achieve greater global harmonization of swaps rules. With respect to the provisions pertaining to commercial end users concerns. the agency has sufficient authority to address the goals outlined in the legislation and in most cases has already done so."" He also states: ""I have concerns that title II of the bill includes language that would complicate the agencys longstanding statutory requirements to consider costs and benefits in its rulemaking. imposing additional. unworkable standards and creating confusion that is likely to lead to more lawsuits instead of policy grounded in datadriven analysis. Had this language been in effect. it would have been harder for the agency to positively respond over the past 10 months to market participants concerns. Title II also imposes procedural requirements on the agency that. to my knowledge. are not followed by any other independent agency. These changes would make it difficult to manage the agency and to ensure accountability and could weaken the Commission for administrations to come."" So there is a disagreement of opinion about how this bill will actually impact the marketplace and how it will actually work. And if. as was claimed. it wasnt going to have any effect. I would be here supporting it. In my opinion. this is going to have significant impacts on the way the Commission does its work. and I think it is going to do more harm than good. I reserve the balance of my time."
1140033477,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to this bill. H.R. 2393 is a premature reaction to the WTO ruling against the U.S. country of origin labeling. or COOL. law. Rather than taking the time to find a workable solution. the committee passed a repeal just 2 days after the WTO issued a ruling. We understand that this needs to be dealt with. My problem with this whole process is that it just is not giving people enough time to look at this and figure out what is a reasonable solution. Most other countries have labeling. The American people want to know where their ag products come from. If we repealed this on meat. we wouldnt be able to know where meat comes from. but we would be able to know where your carrots. lettuce. and all these other things come from. They all have mandatory country of origin labeling. We understand that this needed to be worked on. and we understand that we cant get into a situation with the retaliation. but this is a rush to judgment that is not necessary because this retaliation process is going to take a while. We had the Step 2 cotton case. It went 2 or 3 years before it got resolved. this is going to go faster. but the first thing that has to happen is they have to figure out what the damage is. That is going to take them a while. a month or two. and then they are going to have to have an arbitration panel to get everybody to agree that that is exactly what it is. So this Canadian claim that there are $3 billion in economic losses due to COOL is ridiculous and is based on unsubstantiated and not publicly available data. The U.S. studies. using USDA data. have found little. if any. economic harm. As I said. more than 60 other countries. including Canada. have their own version of COOL. In fact. Canada has a host of protectionist agriculture laws in place that damage the U.S. dairy. poultry. and egg sectors. The Canadian system puts U.S. products at a disadvantage every day. And yet. the Canadians take issue when we try to give consumers additional information on where their meat comes from. claiming it disadvantages Canadian producers. Additionally. consumers are demanding more and more information about where their food comes from and how it is produced. The WTO has repeatedly ruled that COOL is a legitimate goal. Rather than abandon our efforts to provide consumers with this information. we need to have the time so we will be able to find a reasonable solution to work this out without WTO sanctions. I believe it can be done. and it can be done in fairly short order. So. as I said. my biggest problem is that this bill is premature. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140109608,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the bill we are considering today. S. 764. recognizes consumers demand to know more about their food by directing USDA to create a national. mandatory genetically engineered food labeling program. My colleagues may remember that almost a year ago. this Chamber passed legislation to establish a voluntary labeling program. I still believe a voluntary label is best. but. frankly. if we are going to address this issueand. as the chairman said. we are out of timewe need to work with the Senate. This is the compromise that was reached and. in my opinion. is probably the only alternative that is available at this point. Science tells us that foods and ingredients from genetically engineered crops are safe to eat. This technology allows farmers to protect natural resources and provide an abundant food supply. Unfortunately. there is a lot of public confusion about these issues. but labeling products is really more about marketing than any safety concerns that people have. This legislation is needed to avoid a situation where 50 States set up 50 different labels. which would only create confusion for consumers. farmers. and food companies. News reports indicate that Vermonts labeling law. which went into effect July 1. has already led to the loss of some 3.000 products from store shelves. This legislation would rectify this problem while addressing the laws shortcoming. For example. the Vermont law exempts processed food products containing meat from labeling. So cheese pizza would be labeled. but pepperoni pizza would not. That doesnt make any sense. S. 764 closes this loophole. requiring an additional 25.000 food products to meet new labeling requirements. I am also pleased that USDA will be responsible for implementing and enforcing this program. They have the expertise to do this. They have shown this with the labeling that they did for the successful National Organic Program. I would also like to note that S. 764 received strong bipartisan support in the Senate and more than 1.000 farm and food organizations. including the American Farm Bureau Federation. Grocery Manufacturers Association. and Organic Trade Association. and others are calling for passage. In closing. Mr. Speaker. I believe this is a good compromise. It is another example of what the Agriculture Committee has consistently done so well. No one gets everything they want. but at the end of the day. I believe this is a bill that will provide the transparency consumers crave while at the same time allow continued innovation in food production. I urge my colleagues to vote ""yes."" Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."

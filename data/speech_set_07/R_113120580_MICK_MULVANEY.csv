1130000928,Thank you for the opportunity to the chairman and the ranking member. I want to make it very clear what this amendment is and what this amendment is not. This amendment is not about delay. This amendment is not about offering a poison pill to the underlying bill. This amendment is not about preventing money from going where it is very desperately needed. I want that to happen. I want these folks who need this money to get it. I live in an area that is hurricaneprone. I have lived through hurricanes myself. I have lived through floods myself. I have waded through chesthigh water full of snakes and human waste to get into my own business. Ive been able to take advantage of and to use. to rebuild a small business. a small business disaster loan. I want the money to go where it needs to go. Im here for one reason and one reason only today. Madam Chair. and that is to talk about how we can pay for it. Thats it. There was a time when we didnt have to have this conversation. There was a time back during Hurricane Hugo in the late 1980s where we didnt have to talk about how to pay for disaster assistance because the deficit was only $3 trillion. But weve so badly mismanaged our money after that. that by the time we got to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. that we actually did start talking about offsetting and paying for disaster relief and paid for and offset about 40 percent of it. But we didnt learn. We didnt learn from those mistakes. and weve continued to mismanage our money and to run up our deficit to such a point now where its $16 trillion today. and it is incumbent upon us to have the discussion about whether or not we have the money to do this and whether or not its important enough to us to pay for it. I wish very much that we werent here today. I wish very much that we could pass this and easily borrow the money without any questions whatsoever. but weve wasted that opportunity. Weve mismanaged our own finances to the point where we are now no longer capable of taking care of our own. Think about that for a second. In the United States of America. we do not have enough money to take care of our own citizens who need it. Theres no rainy day fund. Theres no savings. What ability we had to borrow money we blew through several years ago with trillion dollar deficits. We dont have enough money saved up to take care of our own people. and thats wrong. Its absolutely wrong. It is important to me that this money goes to the folks who need it very badly. Its so important to me that I think we should pay for it. I think we should be willing. as a body. to come together and say. Look. there are things that we do not need this year. things that we can do without this year so that the people in New York and New Jersey and Connecticut and the other States who so badly need the money can have it. without us having to go hatinhand to other nations of this world and say. Would you please lend us money so that we can take care of our folks who need it so badly? I hope the amendment passes. I hope the amendment passes so that I can vote for the bill. I want this money to go where it is so desperately needed. But the time has come and gone in this Nation when we can walk in here one day and spend $9 billion or $17 billion or $60 billion and not think about whos paying for it. This is important money. Its important to you. its important to me. and its important to everyone in here. But its important enough for us to pay for it ourselves. For that reason. I encourage passage of this amendment and passage ultimately of the underlying bill. With that. I would yield 11/2 minutes to the gentleman from California
1130010955,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. last year at this time I came before this body and I offered as an amendment. as a possible replacement. the budget offered by the President of the United States. It failed overwhelmingly. In fact. I think it failed to receive a single vote. I did that in order to promote a debate. and I think we had that debate. I think that was healthy. Remember. a budget is more than just a spending document. It is also a vision document. I had hoped to be able to do the exact same thing this year. to bring forth the Presidents budget to discuss not only the spending levels in that budget. but also the vision contained in that particular budget. Imagine my surprise then when this week came around and we waited for the Presidents budget and it was not offered. It was not offered for the first time in modern history. This is the first time in modern history that a President has failed to offer a budget before the United States House of Representatives took up the topic. Its the very first time since the Budget Act of 1921. I dont know how were supposed to discuss the Presidents vision for the Nation as contained in the budget when its not here. I think thats wrong. Its required by law. Mr. Chairman. The law requires the President to submit a budget before today. I believe this is now the third or fourth time hes been late during his Presidency. Its inexcusable. Its inexcusable. regardless of the party of the President. not to follow the law and not to offer a budget. So its with great regret. Mr. Chairman. Im not able to offer to you today for discussion before this body the vision for this Nation contained in the Presidents budget because no such documents exist. I actually tried. by the way. I offered a 34page document full of question marks. but appropriately that was ruled out of order as not being able to be brought forward to the House. Again. it is with great reluctance Im not able to offer the Presidents budget. Why am I here? Im here instead to offer as a substitute the budget that passed the Senate Budget Committee last week. Its the first budget to be taken up by the Senate. I believe. in 4 years. I would like to think its a direct result of the bipartisan action that this body took several weeks ago in passing No Budget. No Pay. The Senate assures us. Mr. Chairman. they were going to do a budget anyway. I took them at their word. And Im glad that this body was able to pass out No Budget. No Pay in order to give them the additional incentive to do that. What have they done? What has the Senate offered us? What did the Senate pass out of committee last week on entirely partisan lines? They offered us a budget that increases taxes by $900 billion over the tax window. In fact. thats the smallest amount. Thats the amount they admit to. If you take the Senate committee at their word. they also want to undo the sequester and add an additional $100 billion worth of stimulus money. and they want to do that without impacting the deficit. You can safely assume. I believe. that its $1.5 trillion. not $900 billion. but $1.5 trillion in new taxes out of our colleagues in the Senate on the Democratic committee. They increased spending by $265 billion over the baseline over the next decade. and they also spend $4.9 trillion more than does the Republican budget that well offer later today. Their spending. as offered in their budget. grows by 4.7 percent annually. one of the highest rates of growth other than the last several years in the history of the Nation. The deficit. according to their budget. in the year 2023. will be $566 billion. In contrast. the budget that we will be offering will be surplus in 2023. It will finally allow us to start paying down the debt. and there are no significant reforms at all in Medicare. Medicaid and Social Security. How you can have a vision for this country going forward and not at least discuss possible and reasonable reforms to those programs is beyond me. but somehow it passed out of the Senate committee. Defense is cut by an additional quarter of a trillion dollars over the sequester cuts that weve already had and over the reductions that the Defense Department voluntarily took upon itself during the last budget process. Now. Ive come before this body before. Mr. Chairman. and encouraged this body. in a bipartisan fashion. to look to the Defense Department as possible ways to save money. under the belief that there must be some money in the Defense Department that can be saved in a responsible fashion. What the Senate has done goes so far beyond that that its hard to fathoman additional quarter of a trillion dollars in defense spending reductions over the next 10 years. Finally. perhaps most tellingly and most importantly. the Senate budget never balancesever. It never balances. What does that say? They have no plan for ever repaying the debt. You cannot repay the debt until we start moving to surplus. and any budget that never goes to surplus never pays down the debt. Ive said it before and Ill say it again: if you borrow money from people and are never intending to pay it back. youre not borrowing it from themyoure stealing it from them. Thats exactly what this budget contemplates: borrowing money and borrowing money with no intentiona stated position of no intentionto ever be able to pay the money back. Im glad they did it. Im glad to think that they did it of their own accord without ""no budgetno pay"" hanging over their heads. and I applaud them for at least taking the first step in the last 4 years to put forth their vision of spending and of what the future of this country should hold. At the same time. I think its incumbent upon us to have this debate and then to send a very strong message to the Senate that their ideas are not the right ideas for this country. I hope we get a chance to debate this further. With that. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130026741,I rise today to speak against the amendment. And I think theres one thing that has been overlooked in this debate so far. Mr. Chairman. which is not only was this provision in the bill originally in order to bring sustainability to the flood program. it was also designed to bring fairness to the flood program. What do I mean by that? Yes. the original bill was designed to raise flood rates on some people. It was also designed to lower them on other people. You heard the gentleman from Louisiana properly state that this amendment would have no score. have no impact. The CBO scored it at zero. No impact on the deficit. no impact on spending. Absolutely true. The underlying language in the bill was scored the exact same way. When we passed this bill last year. that provision scored out at zero because the CBO assumed. on its ownits not required by statute to do this. but it did this on its own. The CBO assumed that when rates went up on some people. they would go down on others. That seems to make a lot of sense. doesnt it? That we would have an insurance program that would actually charge folks more who are in riskier areas. but also seek to charge people less who are in less risky areas. I think thats important. I think it bears stating that if this amendment passes. yes. folks who live in highrisk areas will see lower premiums. but the folks who live in lowrisk areas will see higher premiums. We have a chance here to bring some sanity to something in a government program. We have a chance to bring reason and rational thought to this government program by saying people who are in riskier areas should pay more. Are there protections there? Yes. Are they necessary? Absolutely. But at the end of the day. this program was designed to bring some sanity to this flood program. which is why so many people. myself included. voted for this originally. I absolutely think this is wellintentioned. I disagree with the impression that these are unintended consequences. These are the exact intended consequences of the underlying bill. that we would simply charge folks who are in risky areas more. If you live 7 feet below sea level in New Orleans. your rates probably should go up. If you live 600 feet above someplace else. your rates possibly should go down. I think its important to know that. yes. there are people in my State who will pay more because of this law. There are also people in my district who will pay less. and that will be turned on its ear if this amendment passes. So I would encourage us to consider that what we did last year was accurate and correct and brought some muchneeded sanity to this program. With that. I yield the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman. to the gentleman from Georgia .
1130034028,I come before you today to talk a little bit about energy. Later on today. well be talking more about the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act. part of the Republican Partys alloftheabove energy program. Its a good opportunity for us to talk about various different things in energy. I was home. Mr. Speaker. a couple of weeks ago going through one of my manufacturing facilities in my district. and I asked some of the folks who were working there what we could do here to help create more American manufacturing jobs. And I was struck by the answer. The answer was very clear. They said. Keep our energy costs down. They also talked about regulation. They also talked about health care. They talked about a lot of the things we hear all over the place. But the first thing that they mentioned to me. which was to keep energy costs down. was very interesting. I said. Why is it so important? They make rolled rings. they do heavy manufacturing. Its a metal foundry. And they said that not only does lower energy keep their costs of materials down and make them more competitive in the world. but lower energy also keeps their cost of operations down. which makes them more competitive in the rest of the world. and. obviously. kept the cost to their employees down of simply getting back and forth to work. Low energy costs were the best thing we could do for this heavy manufacturer back in South Carolina. I think thats very instructive to us. Mr. Speaker. when it comes to answering the question of what were doing for jobs. Were here today to talk about not just energy but about jobs. One of the big pieces to our alloftheabove proposal is the Keystone pipeline. Many people have heard about it. I want to talk for a few minutes about it today. One of the biggest objections the President made to it originally when it came out was environmental. and many people saw this map from Alberta. Canada. down to the Gulf of Mexico. in which the administration very prominently featured that this went through a large aquifer with a name that I cannot pronounce. in all seriousness. The administration wanted to draw attention to the fact that. Oh. my goodness. this pipeline went through this aquifer and it was going to poison the drinking water in all these Midwestern States and wasnt that a terrible thing. This is the map the administration wanted all of us to see. This is the map of the real world. This is the map that shows where these pipelines already function and function extraordinarily well. There are pipelines all over the central part of this country. all over this aquifer already. without any harm to any person. Aquifers usually are several hundred feet deep and pipelines are 10 or 20 feet deep. We have the ability. we have the knowhow. to do this safely and soundly. Weve been doing it for over a century in this country. There are no environmental risks to going in this particular location through this particular aquifer. We know how to do it. and we know how to do it well. Now we hear a new objection. Mr. Speaker. We hear an objection that the administration doesnt want to backslide. I heard an interview today where a Democrat activist used that word six or eight times in about 2 minutesdidnt want to backslide on carbon. that we couldnt do this pipeline because it would encourage additional use of gasoline. It would make gas cheaper and that would be bad because we would use more of it. Thats the administrations current position. Its absolutely absurd. If you go to Canada. if you go to where the oil sands are. to where this raw material is. who will you see? Youll see the Chinese. If we dont use this oil. if we do not refine this oil. if we do not take advantage of this particular natural resource that is right across our border. the Chinese will. and it will be used in a fashion that would offend the sensibilities of most of the people who care about the environment. Ive been to China. I remember landing at the runway and not being able to see the end of the runway out of the window because the pollution was so bad. That is how this material is going to be used if we allow it to go overseas. We have the ability now to keep this material in this country. We have the ability now to help keep our energy prices down. We have the ability now to help keep Americans at work and put additional Americans back to work. And to the extent we keep it out of the hands of the Chinese where there are no rules on how they use this material. we actually have a chance to help the environment. The Keystone pipeline keeps energy prices down. puts American people back to work. and protects our environment. It is absolutely absurd that it hasnt been approved already. Mr. Speaker. and it needs to be approved now.
1130058266,Mr. Speaker. I have been sitting here for the past 4550 minutes watching the debate. It strikes me that with all of the financial terms and with some of the heated rhetoricand it has been heatedI never thought I would see the day where enlightened selfinterest was called a cancer in this Nation. I wonder what Alexis de Tocqueville would think about that. But in any event. with all of that. Mr. Speaker. it strikes me that we have lost sight of what we are talking about. We are talking about a bill. what the bill specifically does. and why. Lets talk first about why we are here. We have a situation where DoddFrank has given authority to the SEC to make some rules. The Department of Labor also thinks it has the authority to make rules in the same area. I hope we can all agree that there is a potential for conflict there. We all know what it is. We have seen it a hundred times before. We dont want the SEC to come out and say that you cant do X and have the Department of Labor come out the next week and say. but you have to do X. There are hundreds of examples like that in the Federal Government. and this bill is simply trying to address that. How is it trying to do that? What does the bill do? Number one. it asks the two agencies to work together. Someone please tell me how that is a bad thingand a cancer of all thingson this Nation. It then requires the two agencies to actually try and figure out if there is a problemto ask them to identify a problem before they come up with a solution. Again. I think this makes a good bit of sense. The questions that we require them to ask in this bill are pretty simple: Are investors being systematically harmed? Would new rules limit peoples access to investment advice? What are the costs and benefits of the rule? How is this controversial? And I would suggest to you. Mr. Speaker. that it is not. That is the reason that it came out of committee on a bipartisan basis. the reason it is going to pass today on a bipartisan basis. and the reason that it has the bipartisan basis that it does in the Senate. Too often I think we get sidetracked by coming in here and giving big speeches. and perhaps sometimes I am as guilty of that as anybody else. But today we have completely lost sight of why we are here. I hope we can come together and pass this bill this afternoon.
1130075357,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 1944. the Private Property Rights Protection Act of This legislation addresses the eminent domain practice of seizing private property for the ""public benefit"" of economic development. which was deemed constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in its decision in Kelo v. City of New London. This bill prohibits a state or local government from seizing private property for economic development if that state or local government receives federal economic development funds. and prohibits the federal government from exercising eminent domain powers for economic development purposes. While it has not received much attention or debate in the full House of Representatives. my colleagues on the Committee on Financial Services and I have become increasingly concerned about a new proposed use of eminent domain which would be incredibly destructive to our housing markets and to Main Street investors alike. Dozens of communities across the country are considering a vulture funddeveloped investment scheme by which the municipalitys eminent domain power is used to acquire underwaterbut otherwise performingmortgage loans held by privatelabel mortgagebacked securities and then refinance those loans through programs administered by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Our housing finance system depends on private capital to take risk. make loans. purchase mortgagebacked securities. and help millions of Americans fulfill the dream of homeownership. What this eminent domain scheme considers would be incredibly destructive to the finance of homeownership and would do little more than help a few homeowners who can already afford their mortgage and line the pockets of the investors who developed this proposal. Who would invest in a mortgage knowing that their investment could be stolen just a few months or years later? Ironically. this new risk to the housing finance system would freeze the return of private capital to our markets at a time when many in Congress are looking for ways to increase the role of the private sector and decrease the federal governments footprint. Using eminent domain in this manner will hurt Main Street investors the most. Those investors and pensioners may be invested in mortgages sitting in communities considering this planlike Richmond. Californiaand not even know it. They are the ones who will suffer the most from this particular form of eminent domain."
1130086193,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is good to be back this year to once again offer the Presidents budget as an amendment to the Republican budget. That is right. it is the Presidents budget that I will be offering again this year. You may recall. Mr. Chairman. that I did this two years ago in an effort to try and drive a debate over what I thought was a misguided document. a document that the President had offered us that I thought offered bad ideas for the future of this country. I came in and offered an amendmentas none of my Democratic colleagues saw fit to do soand for various reasons failed to get a single vote on that particular amendment. My colleagues at that time. Mr. Chairman. took the position that my amendment really was not the Presidents budget. In hindsight. there were things that we could have tightened up. and we did. We tightened up all the loose ends. There is no question now we specifically reference the Presidents budget in this amendment. This is the Presidents budget. Last year. I tried to come and do it again. Last year. I came in with a blank piece of paper. Last year I came in with a blank piece of paper because the President had not offered his budget in a timely fashion. as required by law. Perhaps rightly so. I was ruled out of order. and we did not have a chance to have a vote on that particular amendment last year. The President has solved that problem for us this year. Still a little late. but at least we have the Presidents budget now in time to debate it here on the floor during budget week. and I am looking forward to doing that. I am looking forward to doing that. Mr. Chairman. because this budget does a lot of things that I disagree with. It does a lot of things that folks on the other side may agree with. But I think it merits a debate. Any time the President of the United States takes the time and the energy to produce a budget. I think it at least merits 20 minutes of debate on the floor of the House of Representatives. I look forward to doing that today. and I look forward to having my friends defend a budget that does things such as continuing the Affordable Care Act. adopting immigration reform. supporting common core. creating a new infrastructure bank. creating a $1 billion climate fund. increasing airport fees on passengers. making Pell grants a mandatory spending program. creating a preschool program for everybody. increasing duck stamp fees. extending emergency unemployment compensation. increasing costs for TRICARE on our veterans. and extending the Federal health benefit programs to same sex partners. I think it is a valid discussion that we should have every year. I was very glad to learn. by the way. that I am not the first person to do this. I was talking to the gentleman from Texas . who did this with President Reagans budget back in the 1980s. I would like to see it become a regular feature in this House. and look forward to the debate as we go forward today. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130086205,Then I will yield myself the balance of the time. Mr. Chair. my friend from Maryland made a couple of different points. He said that he wishes he could vote for the things in the Presidents budget. I will say to him again here. Ill say it to you. I will say to anyone listening the same thing I said to the Rules Committee. the same thing I have said the last 3 years: I keep waiting for one of my colleagues across the aisle to do exactly that. You think I want to be here offering the Presidents budget? If my colleagues across the aisle would like the opportunity to vote on the Presidents budget and the items that are contained in it. they have the ability to do so by simply offering this particular amendment. Failing that. they will have an opportunity to hear today because. if you look at our amendment. it specifically says that the budgetary assumptions underlying this current resolution are based on the data and the policies in the Presidents budget. It goes on to say that the concurrent resolution adopts and incorporates by references all data. policy provisions. and information contained therein. Everything that is in the Presidents budget is in this amendment. They have plenty of opportunity to vote on this. They can do it themselves. They can vote for what I have offered here today. Lastly. I will address the point. and my good friend makes a point every single year that this is a political stunt. I want to tell a story as to why it is not this year. It is a real story. It happened to me. It happened to you. It happened to everybody here who represents folks back home. I get a letter. Mr. Chairman. from the Social Security Administration. telling me that they were closing the field offices in my district. By the way. they closed field offices in everybodys district. In the letter. they said they did that because we had cut their budget by $1 billion for 3 years in a row. I am no longer on the Budget Committee. but as Mr. VAN HOLLEN knows. I used to serve on that committee. and I dont remember us cutting the Social Security Administration by $1 billion each of the last 3 years. So I wrote them a letter and said: you said you are closing the field offices in my district because we cut your budget. Would you please provide me with evidence of that? What they wrote back is a letter that said: we got $1 billion less from Congress than the President asked for in his budget. They got more than they did the year the year before and more than they did the year before that. The actual money they had to spend went up. but because they didnt get what the President asked for in his budget. they closed the offices in our districts that serve our constituents. This is a very important document. Clearly. the Social Security Administration thinks it is an important document. It is at least important enough for us to vote on in the House of Representatives. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.

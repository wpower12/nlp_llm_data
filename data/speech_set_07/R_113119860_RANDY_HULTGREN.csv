1130029920,"Mr. Speaker. as I begin. I do want to wish and hope that you and others of our colleagues had a very happy Fathers Day yesterday. It is one of the most important things for fathers. and mothers. to be able to provide for their families. Mr. Speaker. this evening I would like to talk about what for many Americans is probably the most pressing. or maybe depressing. issue our country is facing right now: jobs. unemployment and the need to create more jobs. But while we as a Nation face challenges. the roadmap to prosperity is clear. The question is. will we act on the recommendations of those who create the jobs. that drive our national economy. Americas small businesses and entrepreneurs? As I speak. the unemployment rate in the United States stands at 7.6 percent. According to the American Enterprise Institute. just 64.4 percent of working age men are employed. the lowest level by far since the Great Depression. and an astounding 5 percentage points lower than at the beginning of the current downturn. A staggering 4.4 million workers have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. In Illinois. my home State. the unemployment rate is even higherat 9.3 percent. The unemployment rate in my home State has been at or above 8.6 percent since April of 2009. 611.000 people are currently out of work in Illinois. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. of the 26.3 million parttime workers. 7.8 million are working part time for economic reasons. meaning the job market wasnt robust enough to support fulltime positions or they could only find parttime work. Jobs. unemployment. job growthall of these are issues on the minds of Americans because. directly or indirectly. all Americans are affected by them. When I meet with small businesses and employers around my district. I ask them. what would it take for you to create just one more job? I would love for them to create 10 more jobs or 20 more jobs or 50 more jobs. but I ask them. what would it take for you to create just one more job? They tell me that the best way to spur job creation and economic growth is to reduce government regulations. cut taxes and simplify the Tax Code. and reduce the size of government by cutting spending. Having a fulltime. stable job and going to work every day is necessary just to meet the challenges of daily living. Americans pocketbooks are pummeled every day. Take gas prices. for instance. The nationwide average price for a gallon of gas has jumped by more than $1 in the last 4 years from $2.58 a gallon in June of 2009 to $3.64 a gallon in June of this year. The price of gas in Illinois right now is averaging $4.08 a gallon. Thats 15 cents per gallon higher than this time last year. In the Chicago area and in my district. prices are even higher. The average price for a gallon of regular gas is a ridiculous $4.28. This is just one example of how everyday life is becoming less and less affordable for ordinary Americans. Creating good. fulltime jobs must be our priority. But small business owners in my district tell me that in the current ""business averse"" climate. this is difficult. if not impossible. for them to do. Jeff. the president of a small industrial pump manufacturing company. is not hiring. He would like to. but he says he cant. He says that ""business owners have to be optimistic that the business environment will be suitable for business growth."" He goes on to say. however. ""The unfriendly business climate coming from Washington and the huge deficit spending reduces optimism that the business climate will continue to improve or even remain stable."" Jeff also says. ""Government regulations and high taxation create uncertaintyand government regulation and inflationary policies are driving up the cost of hiring. The primary resource of business needs is employees."" Then theres Tom. the president of a raw materials distribution company in my district. who says ""the biggest thing holding me back from hiring is uncertainty of the future business climate."" Tom said. ""We have already seen health care cost increases of nearly 20 percent year over year in early 2013. which was on top of the 12 percent increase in 2012."" Tom also stated. ""We pay for 75 percent of the cost of health care for our employees. The parts of health care legislation yet to be implemented will probably penalize us even more for doing the right thing. We do not understand how health care legislation will impact our business."" The recommendations of the small businesses that create the jobs in this countrythe ""engines of the economy""-are critical to increasing employment and spurring growth in our national economy. Reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses is one critical factor toward inducing them to hire more workers. The burdensome nature of proposed Federal regulations is making longterm planning for businesses and growth virtually impossible. An inability to plan is having a paralyzing effect on local investment and hiring. According to the National Federation of Independent Business. in only the last 3 months there have been 6.669 regulatory changes posted or notices posted on the Federal regulatory Web site. Thats an average of 74 regulations per day. Let me repeat that: NFIBs own study says in only the last 3 months there have been 6.669 regulatory changes posted or notices posted on the Federal regulatory Web site. an average of 74 regulations every single day. This regulatory morass forces small businesses to hold onto any extra revenue they may have for fear of new compliance costs. This means foregoing opportunities to invest or hire new workers. Some businesses are forced to close altogether. A recent poll of the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business found that 62 percent of small business owners and manufacturers say the United States own regulations. rules. and taxes impact their businesses more negatively than foreign competition. So our own regulations. according to a majority of business owners. are more harmful to them or more threatening to them than foreign competition. Small businesses are the engine of our Nations economy. They create about twothirds of new jobs in the United States. They employ more than half of the private sector workforce. We need to unleash their potential. So what can be done? Well. we must require regulatory authorities to review their regulations for usefulness and relevance and amend them as necessary to get rid of them if they are obsolete. I have introduced legislation to do just that. H.R. 309. the Regulatory Sunset and Review Act. requires Federal agencies to regularly review regulations on their books and establish a process to sunset those that are duplicative. conflicting. or no longer necessary. Small businesses need a seat at the table at the earliest stages of crafting regulations. Too often. regulators generating rules have little or no contact with the businesses affected by those regulations they implement and. thus. little knowledge of the impact on jobs. Regulators need to assess the longterm costs and benefits of regulationsincluding how they will affect job loss and job creationusing the best available tools and adopt only those regulations whose benefits clearly outweigh the costs. The regulatory process requires transparency and accountability. Sharing publicly the reasons why certain public input was not incorporated and disclosing the data. methods. and models underlying Federal regulatory decisionmaking are also important steps to restoring trust to the Federal regulatory process. Reducing red tape is critical. but cutting taxes and implementing meaningful tax reform that incentivizes businesses to hire is also key to invigorating job growth. When taxes are lower. businesses invest their resources and hire more workers. which is exactly what we want. When taxes are lower. taxpaying citizens are able to keep more of their own money. money to spend as they see fit. to save. or to invest. Congress must consider the impact tax policy is having on small businesses ability to succeed when small businesses are a primary source of job creation in the United States and the engines of economic growth. Small businessesthose with less than 500 employeesrepresent 99.7 percent of all employers. and employ almost half of the private sector labor force55 million workers. In Illinois. again my home State. small businesses represent 98.3 percent of all employers and provide jobs to 2.4 million workers. about half of the private labor force. So when it comes to economic and tax policy. we need to listen to Main Street small businesses and momandpop shops that create the jobs in this country. This is what they are saying when it comes to taxes and spending: Ninetyone percent of small businesses find that the Tax Code is complicated enough to hire their own tax preparer. Eightyfive percent think Congress should revise the Tax Code. Eightyone percent think government should cut spending before ever considering tax increases. Seventyeight percent want to close tax loopholes. And 71 percent agree that tax reform should include lowering the tax burden on small businesses. Thus. to enable small businesses to create jobs and improve the employment climate in this country. tax rates must be low. High tax rates are a problem for small businesses because they siphon off revenue owners need to reinvest for growth and to create jobs. So what needs to be done? The implementation of comprehensive tax reform that makes the Tax Code fairer. less burdensome. and more comprehensible for the folks who pay taxes and the small businesses that invest in hiring. The permanent repeal of the estate. or death. tax. which I have long advocated is critical for small businesses and maintaining a healthy jobs climate. Many small businesses are family owned. The death tax is a major impediment for such businesses to keep operating in a down economy once the owner retires or dies. Protecting small businesses from the death tax is important in order to keep Main Street businesses operating for future generations and for preserving their ability to create jobs as we try to grow this economy. We should cut taxes to spur investment and hiring. Lower tax rates lower the cost of capital and increase the rewards for the risks that businesses take in hiring new workers. I support increasing the small business expensing limit so businesses can immediately recover their costs and invest in their businesses and hire new workers. We must simplify the Tax Code. It is too complicated when 9 out of 10 small businesses must hire someone to prepare their own taxes. Making the Tax Code easier to understand and follow and not placing new reporting burdens on small businesses will help them focus on growing their businesses and creating jobs. In addition to reducing regulatory burdens and cutting taxes. eliminating wasteful spending and reducing the size of government is key to job growth: Current trends have government spending continuing to hover at 22 percent of gross domestic product for the next 10 years. Continued spending adds to the $16.6 trillion debt. and that. in turn. drives up interest costs to pay for borrowing. The CBO estimates that interest paid on the national debt as a percentage of the overall budget will more than double from the current 6.2 percent of the budget to 14.1 percent. consuming an ever larger share of Federal resources. Clearly. we do need to cut spending relative to the overall Federal budget. Cutting spending reduces the amount of money government takes from the private economy. Cutting spending and reducing the size of government relative to the private sector keeps more money in the private sector where it can be put to productive use. such as in hiring and creating jobs. Cutting wasteful spending and balancing our national budget will also absolutely help job growth. Its simple: the Federal Government should not spend more than it takes in if we want to create an environment conducive to job creation. I have advocated for and have supported the budget my House colleagues passed this spring that balances the budget in 10 years by cutting spending and fixing our broken Tax Code so that it is fairer and simpler for everyone. I also support and have worked hard to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Requiring the Federal Government to live within its means and balance spending with the money it takes in. just as families in Illinois and across America have to do. will instill fiscal discipline required to get our economy moving in the right direction. This will also promote confidence and create certainty within our Nations private sector businesses so they can take productive steps towards hiring workers and growing their businesses. According to the small businesses I meet in my district. there are more things we can do to spur job creation in this country. We can open up American markets overseas. New markets mean a greater demand for Americanmade goods. The businesses that manufacture these products will hire workers to meet the demand. In that regard. I have voted in favor of free trade agreements with countries such as Colombia and Panama and South Korea. I have also supported permanent normal trade relations with Russia in order that American manufacturers can receive the benefits of open markets as a result of Russias joining the WTO. We also must eliminate the bureaucracy that hinders the development of American products. Bureaucracy should not stand in the way of American innovation and bringing products to market. I am a cosponsor of the Protect Small Business Jobs Act. This legislation would provide small businesses with a limited grace period to correct regulatory violations. and if the violation is corrected in a timely manner. it allows for the waiver of any sanctions against the small business. This will help business owners like Tom. who. in referring to one Federal regulatory authority with which he was dealing. said. ""Rather than working with industry to fix alleged issues. it is imposing significant fines right off the bat without giving companies the opportunity to first fix the concerns."" Government should be a facilitator. not an obstacle. to new product development and job creation. Mr. Speaker. the pathway to a growing economy and putting people back to work is clear. The small business job creators in my district and around the country have spoken: they want to get rid of burdensome and unnecessary red tape. they want lower taxes and a simpler Tax Code that lends to certainty and encourages growth and investment. and they want the Federal Government to exercise fiscal discipline and to serve as a facilitator for American innovation. product development. and marketing. Mr. Speaker. we can help American small businesses get Americans back to work. America is the land of opportunity where. with a mixture of aspiration and diligence. anyone can achieve ones dreams. Lets redouble our efforts and renew our commitment to our fellow citizens to help them build a bright future for themselves. their children. and for this Nation. I yield back the balance of my time."
1130058152,I thank the gentleman from Texas. Chairman SESSIONS. so much for your work. I want to thank the entire Rules Committee for your important work as well. Mr. Speaker. we have before us today a couple of deserving bills that redirect cumbersome and burdensome Federal regulation and. for a change. put customers first. I am particularly interested in the fate of H.R. 992. the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act. I introduced this bill in the 113th Congress and want to thank my bipartisan cosponsors Representative JIM HIMES and. also from the Agriculture Committee. Representative RICHARD HUDSON and Representative SEAN PATRICK MALONEY. who all have done great work in coming together in a bipartisan way to put together legislation that solves a real problem with the law that was passed a couple of years ago. We also owe a debt of thanks to former Representative Nan Hayworth. who carried this effort in the 112th Congress. H.R. 992 may seem complicated. but the aim is simple: it is to save. for me. Illinois farmers and manufacturers. utility providers. hospitals. and small businesses from higher costs and greater uncertainty. So much that I hear from my constituentsspecifically from people who are looking to grow jobs. grow this economyis the fear and the uncertainty that they are facing. It is not an uncertainty of whether they can do the job or whether they can provide a product or whether they can provide a service. They know they can do that. The uncertainty they are feeling is can they deal with what government is going to do to them if they grow their business and the greater uncertainty that has come from laws that have passed over the last couple of years. One area that has created great uncertainty is this DoddFrank law that was passed a couple of years ago. and specifically. provision section 716 was supposed to really be focused at Wall Street. What we have seen is. it hurts Main Street. Main Street customers more than anything else. taking away options. raising costs. and raising uncertainty for. again. farmers and manufacturers. people who are providing a great product to our consumers in our districts. So this legislation is important to bring back that certainty. For me. as well. this is important. My history is I grew up in a family funeral home. I worked in helping people plan for their future certainly through that family business. but also as an investment adviser and as an attorney helping people. In Congress. my hope is to continue to help peopleand our Nationplan for the future and to fight for future generations to make sure we are going to be making good decisions for our kids and grandkids. This is one of the areas where I see. throughout my lifetime. through our family business and the work that I have done. that trust relationships are important. and the trust relationships that our farmers and our manufacturers have been able to create with their local community banks are important. Unfortunately. this law that was passed a couple of years ago forces those relationships to be broken so that you can no longer use the trusted financial bank or financial services provider in your local area to be able to help you plan for uncertainty in the future. but. again. they are pushed out into other entities that are less regulated and oftentimes offshore. I am so excited about taking this step to bring certainty back. and ultimately. hopefully. as that confidence grows with our farmers and manufacturers and employers. our job creation will grow once again. Investment in hiring people is what we want. That is the number one priority that we are fighting for. There will be time for further debate on this. but I ask my colleagues to adopt the rule for the reasons stated by Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on February 27. He said: 716the section that we are changing hererequires the pushout of certain kinds of derivatives. And it is not evident why that makes the company. as a whole. safer. And what we do see is that it will likely increase costs of people who use the derivatives and make it more difficult for the bank to compete with foreign competitors who can provide a more complete set of services. This is an important change.
1130070735,Thank you. Chairman SMITH. Thank you for your incredible work on this issue. I rise today to remember with sadness the 41 years since the Supreme Courts sweeping ROE v. WADE decision. More than 55 million have lost their lives to abortion. but after that fateful January. the prolife movement was born. As Americans United for Life put it. the prolife movement desires a Nation in which everyone is welcome in life and protected in law. Many warriors have taken up that cause. Next week. many thousands will make the pilgrimage to the March for Life here in Washington to mark and protest the havoc ROE v. WADE has left in its wake. Prolife warrior. Nellie Gray. started the march. and this annual event has rallied Americans and exposed the brutality of this procedure. A country complicit in taking thousands of lives each day tarnishes a legacy of liberty and justice for all. Defending human life at all stages shouldnt be a political issue. Defending human life is a moral issue. It is a moral outrage and a violation of religious liberty for any American to be forced to participate in the funding of abortion. No one believed this more than the late Honorable Henry Hyde. Another warrior for life. and my hero and mentor. Henry Hyde represented the Illinois Sixth Congressional District for 33 years. His crowning achievement. the Hyde amendment. barred the use of taxpayer funds for abortion. Congress has reaffirmed this amendment over and over again. We must protect this principle by passing bills like the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. a bill which would make the Hyde amendment permanent and governmentwide. No one should be coerced into paying for a procedure that violates their conscience. Another warrior for life. Irene Napier. is a woman who lives in the district I represent. the 14th District of Illinois. This Crystal Lake resident has dedicated her life to defending the unborn. Now president emeritus of Right to Life of McHenry County. through the years Irene has stood up to the truth that every child should be given a chance to be loved and wanted. Every human life has inherent dignity that is worth protecting. When we allow abortion. we are really saying that human lives are disposable. that we can throw away anything or anyone that inconveniences us. But people like Irene. Henry. and Nellie and all of us who claim to be prolife know that notion is repugnant. and we reject it. Each child and each mother is a unique gift. No oneno oneshould throw that gift away.
1130108605,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 5120. the Department of Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act. ensures that the Department of Energy has the tools it needs to allow new startups. small businesses. universities. and the general public at large to do what they do best: react to market signals and innovate. The Federal Government and the national labs fill a vital role doing the basic research needed to maintain Americas role as an innovation nation. Far too often. however. the discoveries made in our labs get stuck in our labs. This is due to a number of reasons. and this bill seeks to break down many of those purely bureaucratic barriers. By extending the pilot for ACT agreements within DOE. the labs are given the ability to negotiate more flexible contracts with nonFederal entities that would like to take the labs research and turn it into a viable product. This legislation would also grant the directors of the national labs the signature authority for many agreements with nonFederal entities. Currently. the Secretary of Energy must make these decisions. so decisions a lab director can make over a phone call in the course of a day must weave their way through unnecessary bureaucracy before they land on the Secretarys desk. This bill would streamline that process. H.R. 5120 also seeks to improve the Departments relationship with small businesses that can take part in the SBIR/STTR program. and it encourages the Secretary to enter into agreements with the ICorps program at the National Science Foundation. Our national labs have been at the cutting edge of technological development. and we must always ensure that development is in the national interest. A discovery lost in the lab is a discovery wasted. That is why I would like to thank my good friend from Washington for partnering with me in this effort. as well as the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Mississippi . who were founding members with me in creating the House Science and National Labs Caucus. Chairmen SMITH and LUMMIS. as well as Ranking Members JOHNSON and SWALWELL. were also key in this legislation coming together and bringing it to the floor. This is a true bipartisan. bicameral effort. as Senators COONS and RUiO have a similar companion bill on the other side of the Hill. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. and I reserve the balance of my time.
1130109491,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the Human Trafficking Prioritization Act. H.R. 2283. and commend my friend and colleague Rep. CHRIS SMITH for introducing it. Congressman SMITH is a leader in the global fight against sex slavery and I thank him for all he has done and the leadership he continues to provide. The State Departments Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP) does a fantastic job of maintaining U.S. leadership and accountability in the worldwide effort to combat human trafficking. Today. human trafficking represents a modern form of slavery. It is a crisis that victimizes 21 million people worldwide. In my home state of Illinois. the National Human Trafficking Resource Center estimates 25.000 women and girls are exploited each year by sex traffickers. More than 130 countries have created or strengthened their antitrafficking laws largely due to the work carried out by the JTIP. Its important. therefore. to provide the J/TIP with the standing it needs to maintain the momentum that has resulted in increased prosecution of traffickers. protection of victims. and prevention of human trafficking. The Human Trafficking Prioritization Act does just that. By raising the status of the J/ TIP ""office"" to that of a ""bureau"" and encouraging the Secretary of State to upgrade the ""ambassadoratlarge"" position to that of an ""assistant secretary."" H.R 2283 builds upon the acknowledged accomplishments of the J/ TIP. It will give the J/TIP and the AmbassadoratLarge who leads it level standing with regional and functional bureaus within the State Department and prevent countries and other bureaus at the agency from gaming the tier ranking system. It achieves this without creating additional bureaucracy or additional cost to the government. As a member of the Congressional Human Trafficking Task Force working with the congressional leadership. J/TIP. and international antitrafficking groups to end sex slavery. I know it is critical to keep the fight against human trafficking from being consumed in a bureaucratic shuffle. I am convinced that the Human Trafficking Prioritization Act will only serve to enhance the vital work undertaken by the J/TIP. Human trafficking targets the most vulnerable in a society. The Human Trafficking Prioritization Act will give the J/TIP the integration and voice it deserves within the Department of State to ensure nations are diligent in their efforts to protect the victims and punish the perpetrators of human trafficking. Again. I thank Mr. SMITH for introducing this bill and I urge my colleagues to support its passage."
1130112410,Thank you so much. I want to thank my good friend from Georgia for hosting this hour. It is so important to talk about what really matters to peopleour constituents. hardworking familieswho are just trying to make it through. to get by. and to have hope for a bright future. Mr. Speaker. I rise tonight. troubled over a recent email I received from a constituent of mine. Jessica from Lake in the Hills in Illinois wrote me with concern about her current economic condition. She is a single mother with two teenagers. but like many Americans. she recently lost her job amidst the slow economic recovery. Of course. she is greatly concerned about providing for her children. now that her main source of income has dried up. As Gallup recently confirmed. many Americans like Jessica are having to spend more on items they have to buy and less on items they choose to buy. This mandatory spending is squeezing out everything else in their budgets. The rising costs of basic necessities. like groceries. gas. and utilities for middle class families like Jessicas. smothers them as the cost of daytoday living goes up and up. At the end of the month. there is little left over for them to choose to buy something for their homes. for their families. or for themselves. This is heartbreaking and frustrating because the House has passed legislation to lower energy prices. create jobs. improve worklife balance. and do many other things to help people. Energy prices are an everpresent concern for Americans who drive their kids to school. commute to their jobs. cool their homes. run their manufacturing plants. or harvest their crops. The House passed Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act. and it would do just that. cut prices at the pump by opening new Federal lands to energy development. The Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act would grow Main Street jobs by reducing regulatory burdens on American businesses. The Working Families Flexibility Act would help workers better manage their worklife balance. That is especially crucial for families like Jessicas who are stretched thin between caring for their families and working just to earn a living. The House has also acted on behalf of veterans. and I am so proud of this. When our servicemen and -women return home. the last thing they should have to worry about is unemployment. It is our duty in Congress to ensure there are jobs available for our veterans. but the employer mandate in the Presidents health care law has discouraged many small businesses from hiring more workers at a time when our economy is still struggling to recover. H.R. 3474. the Hire More Heroes Act. is commonsense legislation that relieves the employer mandate burden on businesses that want to hire veterans. It is just astounding to me that the Senate still refuses to take up this legislation that would help our veterans. Still. I do have hope. I have hope that we can work across the aisle to help address the problems of the middle class. That is what the American people sent us here to do. Just this month. the House and Senate passed and the President signed H.R. 803. the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. or the SKILLS Act. which helps reform and modernize our Federal jobs training programs. By 2022. our country will lack millions of skilled workers with degrees beyond high school. such as paralegals. welders. radiology technicians. and police officers. Federally funded job training programs help Americans of all working ages gain the knowledge and skills necessary to reenter the workforce. retrain for new jobs. or increase their value to their current employers. When far more people in my home State of Illinois have given up looking for work and have left the workforce than have found new jobs. our communities need the tools necessary to match available jobs with available and trained workers. H.R. 803 will help put local workforce investment boards in the drivers seat to tailor their services to fill the local jobs of the 21st century. It also streamlines a confusing maze of programs and ensures the business communitys voice is heard. putting businesses above bureaucrats. At the same time. it ensures that we have strong accountability over the use of taxpayer dollars. H.R. 803 is a good examplewhen regular order is followed and both sides agree to talk and work out their differencesthat the House can pass important legislation. We have also passed the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act. a bill I cosponsored. which permanently prevents States and local governments from taxing Internet services. Taxing the onramp to the Internet is just bad policy. It hurts lower income families the most and penalizes Americans for communicating with family or for looking for a job online. Again. this bill passed with strong bipartisan support. The Science Committee recently passed the RAMI Act. which will help the strong manufacturing base we have in Illinois and others across the country. The bill creates a network of nationwide regional institutes. each specializing in the production of a unique technology material or process relevant to advanced manufacturing. Small- and midsized manufacturers can expand their research and development capabilities and train an advanced manufacturing workforce. The Senate also introduced a companion bill. and I trust the RAMI Act will become law soon. When it does come down to it. I truly believe we can all agree on about 80 percent of the issues facing this Nation. Building relationships and working on common goals can help us address the other 20 percent without being divisive. But where does this leave middle class families right now? They are still finding their paychecks dont go as far as they used to go. Energy prices are still high. and groceries arent getting any cheaper. More than 350 bills are stuck in the Senate. Many of those would help Americans get back on their feet again. We dont need political posturing. We need real solutions for hardworking individuals and families. Lets help families like Jessicas and get these bills passed through the Senate now.
1130114456,"I would like to thank the distinguished chair of the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology. the gentleman from Texas. for helping this legislation come to the floor. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 2495. the American Super Computing Leadership Act. is an important update to a current statute which will ensure that America stays at the forefront of supercomputing technology for the benefits it brings to our national security. the economy. and. more broadly. our research capabilities as a Nation. While America and American companies are still leading the way for much of this current technology. it is important to point out that the National University of Defense Technology. in China. is now housing the worlds fastest supercomputer. One of the Department of Energys primary responsibilities within the National Nuclear Security Administration is the maintenance of our current nuclear stockpile. This stockpile stewardship responsibility is carried out with increasingly complex situations. especially as our stockpile has aged. The need for improved parallelism. capabilities. and decreased energy requirements are spelled out in this legislation to ensure the Department carries out a targeted basic research program to overcoming the most pressing needs. This legislation also points out and defines exascale as the next checkpoint to be accomplished. Exascale computers would exceed existing computing power by nearly 10.000 percent. I would like to point out. however. that exascale cannot be seen as the end point. It is just a step toward the larger goal of American leadership in this field. This legislation will ensure that the broader scientific community has access to these facilities on a competitive merit review process. The scientific drivers and the national security responsibilities should be the primary focus of this research. but we must also make sure that the crosscutting benefits of this research are not left at the wayside. This legislation would create partnerships with universities. industry. and the national labs to conduct the research. ensuring that the Nation as a whole benefits from this research more quickly and efficiently. In having the pleasure to represent the great State of Illinois. I have been able to witness how an ecosystem of innovation can best be fostered. and part of this is by making sure that our facilities are open to the public when it makes sense and does not interfere with the core missions of our Federal agencies and the labs. I have been able to see how Fermilab. in my district. and Argonne National Lab. which is just down the road. carry out groundbreaking scientific research. but they also have unintended crossover benefits. such as proton beam cancer therapy. which uses accelerators developed in our labs. User facilities. such as the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne. have given a tremendous research capability to pharmaceutical companies. where companies doing research that used to take weeks can often spend more time with samples in the mail than on the lab bench. The computing capabilities this legislation will help bring about will have tremendous application in the health care and drug development fields. and the modeling simulations this will make available will allow manufacturers to build better prototypes that have been tested thousands of times virtually before they come off the line. This is why I ask all of my colleagues to join me in voting ""yes"" on this important legislation."
1130116030,"I want to thank my good friend from Texas for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to highlight the complexities of our Nations health care system on the eve of the first open season since ObamaCare was launched. I want to offer a hope to the millions of American consumers who still need real solutions to help ensure that their families can obtain necessary and affordable health care. Today. our health care system in America has two faces. It can provide stateoftheart care while. at the same time. can be one of the most complex and frustrating systems in the world. Americans feel the effects of these complexities every single day. They repeatedly put health care near the top of their list of issues that concern them. and they should be concerned. The system today has so many conflicting incentives. rules. and regulations. that few Americans have the ability to make sound and affordable decisions for themselves and their families. ObamaCare introduced a whole new level of fuzziness to an already opaque system. Families are increasingly worried that they will pay more and more for health insurance that covers less and less and lowers the quality of care. They search for longterm economic security. but find unsustainable costs instead. Even with the advent of the Presidents health care law. the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. also known as ObamaCare. many middle class Americans havent found their health care to be more affordable. nor have they felt secure with the current system. Americans have a right to feel frustrated with the Affordable Care Act today. It is far from what they were promised. I have heard stories from too many of my constituents who received letters terminating their coverage. like Julia. from Gurnee. Illinois. or of others facing rising health care costs. like another who told me: ""I wonder if the administration ever thought about those of us who have to pay for our health care coverage with no extra help. and how much more we would be paying."" Or of the employers who have had to eliminate health benefits. or of workers and teachers whose hours have been reduced because employers cant afford the higher premiums. or of families losing access to doctors they have known for decades. Those doctors also face conflicting rules that result in adverse consequences. They want to continue to provide care. but many are no longer accepting Medicare patients and must now require upfront payments for care just to keep their practice open. There arent enough doctors and specialists to go around in the narrow networks. We have tried to address the long and sometimes lifethreatening waits for veterans. Now is the time to address those long lines for everyone else. Surely. this is not the health care system we were promised. nor does it paint a bright future for the health status of Americans. That is why. on August 28. I convened the third Community Leadership Forum in Illinois 14th Congressional District. Our topic? Health care. Our focus? The consumer. I assembled three separate panels to discuss issues ranging from the ACA and how it will continue to affect consumers in 2015. to how technology and innovation can improve health care outcomes. to how best to increase consumer access to and quality of health care. It was clear that there was a thirst for the community to come together. In the weeks preceding the forum. I was excited to hear about the panelists enthusiasm. The forum included CEOs of local and statewide health care organizations and hospitals. CMOs and executive vice presidents of insurance companies. and. most importantly. my constituents. I heard about the issues directly affecting every level of our health care system. Most importantly. our focus remained on offering consumeroriented solutions. Never before had I been confronted with such passion and desire to offer answers for our national health care system and work together to implement solutions. Today. I want to share just a selection of the great ideas that could help American consumers of health care. Many of these will be available in a full report I plan to release on my Web site. hultgren.house.gov. in the coming days. During the first panel. one of the primary challenges health care and small business insurance professionals discussed was how to ensure consumer choice and access to the broader market of providers. I heard numerous times about the need to reduce health care costs overall by pursuing a marketbased system with less regulation. Surprisingly. the only subindustry in health care that is lowering costs and increasing the quality of care is elective procedures. an industry perpetuated by market control. Insurance providers told me the difficulties they face operating within the ACAs demands and slim margins. Certain insurance regulations. like the medical loss ratio. exacerbate costs. These costs translate directly into higher premiums for constituents and businesses. Instead of encouraging higher quality of care and lower costs with advancements in technology and economy. we find ourselves moving in the opposite direction. Relieving these ineffective and inefficient mandates could be a first step to opening up more options for insurers and consumers. In the second and third panels. I heard from hospital executives and university innovators about the biggest challenges facing medical technology and innovation. With innovators and leaders in the biotechnology and medical technology industry at the table. I learned about the everpresent and insurmountable ""valley of death."" the period of time between a potentially lifesaving device or product discovery and its introduction to the broader market. This period is encumbered by regulation and bureaucracy. In Europe. devices and medicines that show promise are approved and brought to market faster and more effectively. To help with technology transfer and to quicken innovation and its application. I learned about ways to fill the gap between discovery and investment. Legislation like the TRANSFER Act. introduced by my colleague. Representative CHRIS COLLINS from New York. will help reduce the strain caused by the valley of death in the innovation process. Another method is the preservation of the BayhDole Act of 1980. One speaker recommended fully funding the FDA to speed the approval process to bring new devices to market in the United States. The conversation went so far as to talk about the intersection of education policy and scientific research. highlighting the need to make sure our kids receive the best STEM education our schools can provide. These conversations clarified that medical innovations are a vital component to strengthening treatments and reducing the costs in the health care system. Throughout the day. it was confirmed again that the current health care landscape is rocky and uncertain. but there are many who are willing and eager to work together to tackle these challenges. The House is also eager to work hard to help fix our health care system. Numerous times the House has said ""yes"" to fixes and alternatives that address our systems deep challenges. We dont need to wait for our health care system to get worse before it gets better. We can work to fix it now. Americans have a right to feel frustrated with the ACA today. It is far from what they were promised. But that should only spur us onward. We are only months from the start of open enrollment. November 15. The question is. can all of us. in Congress. in health care. and constituents. work together to bring muchneeded reform to our health care system? Can we raise the quality of care our country offers while lowering costs for Americans across the country? I believe we can. and I trust these solutions will help get us there. I want to thank my good friend from Texas for yielding me time."
1130121145,"I thank my colleague. Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 4012. and I thank the gentleman from Arizona and the chairman of the Science Committee for bringing this important legislation to the floor. H.R. 4012 is a critical step in restoring the public trust necessary for EPA to accomplish its core mission. Transparency was a major campaign promise the current President made to the American people. and here is a way we can help the President finally follow through on one of his goals. This should be a strong bipartisan effort for anyone that believes their government has a duty to be accountable to the American public we serve. H.R. 4012 follows a basic tenet that nearly all Americans agree on: public policy should be dictated by public science. Unfortunately. transparency. along with oversight by the American peoples dulyelected representation. has been something EPA scoffs at. This must change. The President continues to use his regulatory agencies to bypass the will of the legislature in a number of cases. and policy from EPA has been one of the worst offenders. Everyone here believes in clean air. clean water. and necessary regulations. but what we have now is a regulatory agency attempting to put in place legislation which this Congress previously rejected in prior sessions. This is not a government that is working for you. Americans also believe in clear laws and a fair judicial system where both sides can state their case and an adequate resolution can be found. This is why this closeddoor regulatory approach is so frightening. When someone accuses you of a crime in a court of law. they must stand before that court and make that claim. Your deposition is given to both sides. and you cannot hide behind secret testimony which is only given to the prosecutor. This is what we have now happening at EPA. EPA legislates through regulations. and the defendant has no chance to see where EPAs claims are coming from. It is time for the American people to see behind the curtain. and it is unjust to continue using claims from the Agency that cannot be contested only because they cannot be seen. I would also like to correct unfounded claims made by opponents of this legislation. Nothing disallows EPA from using the most uptodate scientific information to make public health decisions. It would certainly be my hope that the research institutions would make this available. but it would ultimately be their decision whether or not EPA could use their data. If I dedicated my life to studying these complex issues. I would want to make sure it could be used. The other claim is that this bill will make public personal health care information. which would be against the law. This legislation makes clear that nothing in this bill requires the ""public dissemination of information. the disclosure of which is prohibited by law."" The data sets must only be made available in a manner that is ""sufficient for independent analysis and substantial reproduction of research results."" Numerous congressional hearings and testimony from experts have made it clear that this information can easily be made anonymous. This is how data sets are presented to the peerreview community and published for journals already. This is the transparency the American people deserve. They should no longer be held guilty from data they cant see or black box economic analyses deemed proprietary. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this bill."

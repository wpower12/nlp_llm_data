1130023688,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill. House Resolution 228 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 3. the Northern Route Approval Act. The rule makes 10 of the 25 amendments submitted to the Rules Committee in order. nine of which were sponsored by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. and it provides for a robust debate in the House of Representatives. The underlying bill was marked up by three committees of jurisdiction. and each committee reported the bill favorably with a bipartisan vote. Additionally. the U.S. Senate. on March 22. 2013. voted to approve the pipeline by a vote of 6237. Mr. Speaker. there are four simple reasons this bill has garnered bipartisan support: it creates American jobs. it increases our energy independence. it strengthens our national security. and it will contribute to lower gas prices. This bill leads where the President has wavered. and finally approves the northern route of the Keystone XL pipeline. which has been studied for over 1.700 days by 10 Federal agencies and several State environmental agencies. The U.S. Department of State has issued four environmental impact statements. at a total length of 15.500 pages. These studies prove that the vast majority of the project will not result in a significant environmental impact. and mitigation efforts will be undertaken to reduce any environmental impact. Additionally. the project includes 57 projectspecific special conditions to ensure the maximum level of safety. Due to these conditions. the U.S. State Departments Environmental Impact Statement found that the pipeline will have ""a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline system."" For 4 long years. multiple studies and well over 15.000 pages of environmental analysis. the administration claims that the XL pipeline still cannot be approved. We all hear the echo of the President chiding Congress with his slogan. ""We cant wait."" I would like to ask. Mr. Speaker. if not now. when? This bill answers that question. and the answer is today. It is clear that this pipeline will create jobs. increase national security. and contribute to lower gas prices. For this reason. H.R. 3 breaks the Presidential logjam and approves this worthwhile project. On December 23. 2011. both the U.S. House and the Senate unanimously approved. and the President signed into law. a bill that required the President to approve the pipeline unless the President determined that the project did not serve national interests. On January 18. 2012. the President said ""no"" to the pipeline. claiming that it did not serve national interests. By preventing this project from moving forward. he said ""no"" to 42.100 construction and manufacturing jobs at a time when Americans need work. He said ""no"" to cheaper gas prices for goods and services which could result in reduced energy cost. As you know. Mr. Speaker. lower energy costs lead to lower manufacturing and shipping costs which. in turn. contribute to less grocery. gas and utility bills for the average American family. He said ""no"" to increased diversification of Americas oil supply. He said ""no"" to reduced dependence on foreign oil. All these benefits this generation could pass on to future generations. By this inaction. the President said ""yes"" to more oil from barges from the Middle East. When the pipeline is finalized. it will transfer 830.000 barrels of oil each day. which totals nearly half of our current daily imports from the Middle East. The President said ""yes"" to our ally. Canada. taking its business elsewhere. to China. rather than the United States. The oil from the tar sands of Canada will go on the market somewhere. whether we approve the XL pipeline or not. This is our chance to ensure Americans will have the opportunity to benefit from the energy supply. not China. The State Department acknowledged that the United States would be more secure if we relied more heavily on a nonOPEC source. such as Canada. for our energy needs. According to the State Department. and I quote: NonOPEC Canadian crude oil supplies advance the energy security of the United States. given Canadas close proximity. our free trade agreements. and our close bilateral relationship with a stable democracy. Canada is a more reliable and costefficient source of energy than the foreign oil that we depend on from the Middle East. Africa. and other regions of the world. For these reasons. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The relevant committees of jurisdiction have provided us with a bipartisan bill that will create American jobs. ensure energy independence. increase our national security. and contribute to the lower gas prices. I encourage my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on the rule and ""yes"" on the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130023726,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all. the amendments that were talked about are amendments that would add to a process that we have said is very sacred. We dont want to change the process. We dont want to circumvent it. Were not circumventing any process. Because this crosses a national boundary. theres only one thing left to do: we need the President to okay it. Every study that could be donethis started in 2008 and continued in 2009. 2010. 2011 and 2012. and now here we are in 2013. Its out of opportunities to be studied. Its time. This rule provides for ample and open debate and makes in order proposals from both sides of the aisle. As I stated before. this bill represents so much more than the approval of an 875mile long pipeline. It represents 42.100 jobs. greater energy independence. and will benefit our Nation for generations to come. The Keystone XL pipeline will allow 830.000 barrels of oil to flow each day to domestic refineries that employ hardworking Americans. This number represents half of our current daily crude oil imports from the Middle East. This will not only diversify our energy sources. but it will reduce our dependence on foreign oil from countries that in many ways do not share or respect our freedom and democracy. As we speak. the southern gulf coast segment of the Keystone XL pipeline is being constructed. It didnt require Presidential approval for one reason: it didnt cross a national border. It was studied by the requisite State and Federal environmental agencies. it was approved. and now its approximately 50 percent complete. Four years and 15.000 pages represent more than enough time and paper to study this pipeline. Any more paper and well need an environmental impact statement to study the effects of the environmental impact statement. Our Nation is crying out for job creation. energy independence. and lower gas prices. Today. we have the opportunity to answer that call and to remove the few remaining barriers that stand between Americans and the relief they desperately need. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this rule and passage of the underlying bill.
1130025623,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the rule and the two underlying bills. House Resolution 243 provides for an open rule for consideration of H.R. 2216. the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2014. and H.R. 2217. the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014. This rule provides ample opportunities for Members from both the minority and majority to participate in the debate. and it does not limit the number of amendments that may be considered. so long as the amendments comply with the rules of the House. My colleagues from both sides of the aisle agree that these appropriation acts for fiscal year 2014 are the products of an open. collaborative. and bipartisan process. They provide critical funding for military construction. housing. schools. and medical facilities for our servicemembers and their families. important veteran programs. the protection and security of our airports. seaports and national border. and disaster relief efforts. They also reduce duplication. improve oversight. encourage efficiency. and increase coordination of services. Mr. Speaker. these bills address nonpartisan issues that affect every one of us. The seamless operation of these agencies and programs and projects will benefit all Americans. Let me first address H.R. 2216. the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2014. This fiscally sound bill funds programs that are necessary to keep our promises to our veterans and to train. equip. house. and support the brave men and women in uniform. as well as their families. This bill provides over $73 billion in discretionary funding. which is $1.4 billion above the enacted fiscal year 2013 level. It continues to provide advanced funding that was approved in fiscal year 2013 for veteran medical care and funds programs to reduce the staggering backlog which severely delayed the process of veteran benefits claims. This advance funding will ensure that our veterans have full access to medical care regardless of where we stand in the annual appropriation process. H.R. 2216 funds military construction projects. including family housing. military medical facilities. and Department of Defense education facilities. It also funds critical VA medical services and provides for a unified electronic health record system to integrate Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs health records. Currently. our veterans must physically present a hard copy of their DOD health records at their VA appointments. and physicians are unable to look up the patients medical history if a patient does not have their records with them. This bill addresses this frustrating and inefficient process and will begin to replace an archaic paper record system with an electronic system that will ensure our veterans will be efficiently served and receive the care they need and deserve. Next. Id like to talk about and highlight a few of the important provisions in H.R. 2217. the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014. This bill is essential to protect the security of our national borders and the safety and wellbeing of all Americans. This bill provides $38 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Homeland Security. which includes funding for 21.370 Border Patrol agents and nearly 22.800 Customs and Border Protection officersthe largest totals in history. It also directs U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to train agents to identify and assist victims of human trafficking and directs ICE to increase spending on human trafficking and smuggling investigations. H.R. 2217 also provides funding for FEMA to ensure our Nation is prepared to provide disaster relief and funds the Coast Guard. Finally. Id like to reiterate that these bills strengthen our national security and continue the wellbeing of our brave servicemembers. their families. and other veterans. They also recognize that our growing debt threatens the stability and safety of our Nation. and for this reason these bills make recommendations to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. duplication. and overhead. Once again. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The Appropriations Committee has worked hard to provide us with two fiscally responsible appropriation bills that will meet the housing construction and medical needs of our military and provide support to their families. They will keep our promises to Americas veterans. and they will enhance our national security. I encourage my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on the rule and ""yes"" on the underlying bills. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130043817,"Mr. Chair. this amendment is straightforward. It closes a regulatory loophole that allows Federal agencies to make major policy changes without appropriate congressional review. As currently written. the REINS Act covers agency rules developed through the formal notice and comment rulemaking process. but thats not enough. By removing two exceptions from the definition of ""rule."" we ensure that agency actions that serve a regulatory purpose are subject to the $100 million threshold. The current administration circumvents congressional oversight and public input by issuing general statements of policy known as ""guidance documents"" in order to achieve its intrusive regulatory agenda. This tactic shields major and costly policy changes from any congressional oversight laws put in place to protect citizens. Let me give you two examples. The EPA used a guidance document to remove the word ""navigable"" from the definition of ""waters of the United States."" This would expand its jurisdiction to potentially regulate traditional State waters and roadside ditches that hold water after rainfall. The EPA estimates that this guidance document could cost Americans $171 million annually. Last month. we all know the administration used a guidance document to delay the health care laws employer coverage mandate. The CBO estimates this guidance document will cost $12 billion. Both of these guidance documents make substantive changes to policy without congressional review. Under the REINS Act as currently drafted. these costly guidance documents would escape the disapproval process even though they breach the $100 million threshold established by REINS. Good policy does not have to be hidden within the cloak of bureaucratic power grabbing. My amendment seeks to shine light into the dark corner of regulatory infrastructure that is abused by those with an agenda that must be hidden from view. It simply allows elected Representatives the opportunity to review policy changes issued through internal guidance that exceed the $100 million threshold. Hardworking taxpayers are owed a choice and a voice through their elected Representatives in all major policy changes that impact their jobs and their pocketbooks. This amendment secures this fundamental measure of government. accountability. and respect for taxpayers. By requiring a vote of Congress in all substantive agency rules. the REINS Act results in more clearly written legislation. it improves the regulatory process. and it holds government accountable to the American people for the laws imposed upon them. I urge my colleagues to support the Webster amendment and strengthen the REINS Act by closing this guidance document loophole. which erodes the rule of law. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130057221,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill. House Resolution 385 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 3080. the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. the first WRRDA bill since 2007. The rule makes 24 amendments submitted to the Rules Committee in order. half of which are sponsored by my colleagues across the aisle. and it provides for robust debate in the House of Representatives. The underlying bill was marked up by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. which reported the bill favorably with unanimous bipartisan support. The bill before us today garnered that support because of four reasons: this bill reforms the Federal bureaucracy. this bill is fiscally responsible. this bill strengthens accountability. and this bill creates jobs. Mr. Speaker. talk to anyone around the country that relies on the Army Corps of Engineers. talk with anyone that depends on our water infrastructure. water resources and so forth. talk to anyone who wants to develop a new water resource infrastructure. talk to anyone who ships in or out of our harbors or ports. Maybe you have the opportunity to talk with our shipping companies. or maybe with the women and men who work on our tugboats and barges. or maybe with the farmer who needs to get his corn to the right markets. or maybe the manufacturer who needs to ship her product or his product to a foreign customer. or maybe the port director who is trying to get America prepared for the economic opportunities that will come with the larger ships coming through the Panama Canal. Mr. Speaker. if my colleagues spoke with these men and women. they would hear the same refrain: our bureaucracy delays American investment. our bureaucracy costs American jobs. and our bureaucracy helps Americas foreign competitors. The approval process of our critical water infrastructure takes years too long. and sometimes well over a decade. One project that my friend from Florida is familiar with is a project in Port Everglades. which has been studied for nearly two decades. Some bureaucrats have spent their entire career studying this one project. The study of the project of Port Everglades is a prime example of Washington bureaucracy crushing Americas jobs and Americas future. This bill before us today does away with these delays: it sets hard deadlines on the time and cost of the studies. it consolidates or eliminates duplicative studies. it requires concurrent project review by multiple agencies. and it puts our projects on a path to construction. Mr. Speaker. this bill reforms Federal bureaucracy. but it also is fiscally responsible. We all know that our Nation spends too much. our Nation oftentimes spends money haphazardly without a plan and without restraint. This bill does not. Chairman SHUSTER is committed to restraining spending and is committed to managing American taxpayer dollars wisely. This bill is proof of that. This bill restrains spending. I commend Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member RAHALL for actually making the tough choices necessary to get our budget in order. Mr. Speaker. when was the last time an infrastructure bill was brought to the House floor and it cut more than it spent? The bill before us today does just that: it deauthorizes $12 billion of old. inactive projects. it pays for the new projects by canceling old projects. and it sunsets the construction of new projects in order to prevent future backlogs. Mr. Speaker. this bill reforms Federal bureaucracy. is fiscally responsible. and it strengthens accountability. Many of our constituents. when they hear us talk about infrastructure. remember the days of pork barrel spending. Many of our colleagues might remember the 1939 movie about a newly appointed Senator who goes to Washington running headon into a political machine built on earmarks and pork barrel spending. ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is a dramatic rendering of how most infrastructure bills were put together in the past. In fact. the bill that was debated in the movie was a water resource bill. and the filibuster was over an earmark in that bill. This bill ends that earmark process. The bill before us today strengthens accountability for the American people. Gone are the days of inserting earmarks at the last minute. Gone are the days of creating new pet projects. Gone are the days of wasting taxpayer money on pork barrel spending. Mr. Speaker. this bill contains no earmarks. It also establishes a new. transparent process for future bills that will ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent on necessary projects. It will prioritize our spending and provide strong Congressional oversight. This bill reforms Federal bureaucracy. is fiscally responsible. strengthens accountability. and creates jobs. The key to creating American jobs is expanding our economy. American producers must be able to get their products to the world market. This push to sell to the world is a highstakes competition that America must win. Our farmers are being pressured by our neighbors in South America. Our manufacturers are being pressured by both European and Asian countries. Our energy producers are being pressured by many foreign countries in all corners of the globe. Investing in our infrastructure will boost trade. increase American competitiveness. and position our country for economic growth. These advancements will put America to work. While construction workers will immediately be put to work on these projects. every single American job that depends on our transportation infrastructure will benefit from this bill. Our economy will grow. our producers will compete with the world. and American jobs will be created. Mr. Speaker. it is easy to see why this bill garnered unanimous bipartisan support from the members of the committee and why it deserves to be passed here. This bill reforms Federal bureaucracy. this bill is fiscally responsible. this bill strengthens accountability. and this bill creates jobs. For these reasons. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill. Chairman SHUSTER. Ranking Member RAHALL. and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure have provided us with a unanimously supported bipartisan bill that will move our Nation forward. I encourage my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on this rule and ""yes"" on the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130077978,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying bills. House Resolution 501 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 2641. the Responsibility of Professionally Invigorating Development Act. known as the RAPID Act. The resolution also provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 2824. Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America. Lastly. the resolution provides suspension authority for legislation to provide muchneeded financial relief to the government of Ukraine. The resolution makes in order all of the amendments submitted to the Committee on Rules regarding the RAPID Act. It makes in order half of the amendments submitted to the Committee on Rules regarding the coal jobs bill. Of the amendments made in order. more than half are sponsored by my colleagues across the aisle. The resolution provides for a robust debate in the House of Representatives. In July. the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform. Commercial. and Antitrust Law held a hearing on H.R. 2641. The subcommittee reported the bill favorably. without amendment. by voice vote. On July 31. the Committee on the Judiciary ordered H.R. 2641 favorably reported without amendment. In August. the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources held hearings on H.R. 2824. In November. the Committee on Natural Resources. by a bipartisan vote. voted favorably for the bill and reported it out. Mr. Speaker. the bills before us today garnered majority support and bipartisan support for one simple reason: they ensure the regulatory process works for Americans. as intended by Congress. Across the Nation. energy and infrastructure projects are being significantly delayed. In some cases. the environmental reviews have continued on for a decade or more. According to a study by the Chamber of Commerce. current delays are costing more than $1 trillion in economic development. and those delays are also prohibiting the creation of 1.9 million jobs. As our country continues to struggle through a lackluster recovery. ensuring these beleaguered studies are completed would help generate jobs and create economic growth. Mr. Speaker. in 2011. President Obamas Council on Jobs and Competitiveness recommended action to simplify regulatory review and streamline project approvals to accelerate jobs and growth. Just this year. in his State of the Union. President Obama called for permit streamlining. He said action must be taken to ""slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible."" News reports like to highlight our disagreements. In fact. it often seems that there is nothing that we can agree on. That is not true. Earlier this term. the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3080. the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. That bill passed by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 4173."
1130106686,"Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill. House Resolution 669 provides a closed rule. as is customary for bills that are reported by the Committee on Ways and Means. for H.R. 5021. the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. On July 10. the Ways and Means Committee marked up H.R. 5021. The committee ordered the bill favorably reported by voice vote. The bill is simple. It extends our transportation programs and our reforms enacted by MAP21. and it pays for the extension without raising taxes on hardworking American taxpayers. This extension is crucial. Prior to the expiration of MAP21 later this fall. the highway trust fund is expected to encounter a funding shortfall. The Secretary of Transportation has warned that. as early as August. payments from the trust fund to the States will begin to be delayed. Lets be clear: this bill is just an interim remedy for our current situation. It is not a solution to our transportation funding problem. As a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I can testify to the work that Chairman SHUSTER and the committee are doing to provide a multiyear authorization bill. It is a deliberative. thoughtful process. The underlying bill advances that process. The underlying bill proposes policies that have previously received bipartisan support. Further. these policies have previously also been embraced by the Senate. The bill extends the surface transportation programs and funding through May 2015. It provides stability and certainty for States. It continues our investments in infrastructure. It staves off job losses at the height of the construction season. And it allows the process to move forward toward a longterm solution. Some have suggested or proposed a shortterm patch for just a few months. There are some who would like to see this just provide enough time to get through the election. A shortterm extension would guarantee a crisis. Even worse. that manufactured crisis is easily avoidable. Central Floridians are still trying to dig their way out of years of economic downturn. We are focusing on improving our families financial situation. and certainly we dont need a downturn in constructionand especially infrastructure construction in the State of Florida and in my particular area. central Florida. A shortterm extension is. at best. feeble and. at worst. irresponsible. Washington should not do less when it can do better. Washington should not add to the list of crises of its own doing by passing a shortterm patch when a longerterm answer is within reach. The task at hand remains avoiding the expiration of the existing transportation authorization. The existing authorization is actually a good bill. MAP21 included significant reforms to cut out Federal red tape and bureaucracy. It streamlined the project delivery process. It reformed and consolidated programs. It improved safety. It ended the process of earmarks in transportation bills. MAP21 set deadlines for slowmoving projects. It set a new NEPA funding threshold and expedited projects that were destroyed by disaster. MAP21 consolidated more than 100 programs by nearly twothirds. It eliminated dozens of ineffective programs and provided more resources and flexibility to States. It also incentivized States to seek partners in the private sector to finance and operate infrastructure projects. Further. MAP21 passed the House by a strong bipartisan vote of 37352. including the support of the gentleman from Colorado. It passed the Senate by an equally strong bipartisan vote of 7419. The White House issued a statement that said they were pleased with the bill. While we continue with a process that will lead to a multiyear authorization bill. there is no reason why we should not support an extension of MAP21. Extending MAP21 through next summer is simply an extension of another year of good transportation policy. Once again. I rise in support of this rule and the potential this extension holds for producing a thoughtful process that results in a quality longterm authorization bill. I encourage my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on the rule. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130106724,"Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. This rule provides for ample and open debate. It advances a bill that originally passed the House 37352. one of the most bipartisan votes we have had since I have been here. The underlying bill extends good public policy. That policy was supported. like I said. by 373 Members of the House. 74 in the Senate. and signed by the President. While we must look forward to the passage of another multiyear transportation authorization. there is no reason we should not pass the extension. Certainty means ""the state of being free from doubt or reservation. confident. sure."" Extending our transportation programs until next summer provides our States with certainty. It also ensures that our highway trust fund does not become insolvent at the end of this month. This extension will keep our transportation construction workers on the job. It will keep our transit systems functioning at full capacity. It will continue our investments in our economy. It will do all these things. without raising taxes on the American people. Most importantly. it advances the process of a multiyear transportation bill. I look forward to working with Chairman SHUSTER and other members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure as we focus on producing a longterm bill that strengthens our transportation programs. The passage of this extension gives us the opportunity to work together and produce a solution that continues to deliver an unmatched transportation system for the American people. It is our responsibility to make sure that that happens. This bill is the last chance to fulfill our responsibility to the American people and to provide our States with certainty before the highway trust fund reaches insolvency. I urge all Members of this House to vote for the rule. vote for the bill. keep our transportation systems operating. and let us work together for a longterm solution. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows:"

1130023757,I thank the ranking member for the time. I also thank him for his longtime commitment to American energy independence. I. too. share that. I have been the supporter of a bipartisan energy bill that brought environmental groups and The Heritage Foundation together and said maybe we can find some solutions to this. I have been a supporter of this project from the beginning. The problem is. today. this bill has nothing to do with that. It has to do with politics. Today is an example of why this body is less popular than hepatitis amongst the American public. Its not only not going to do anything. its going to set us back. Many of us want this project done. but I have to tell you that the worst thing we can do is build this and have a problem with it. We hear about the number of pages of regulations that are there. Maybe we needed a couple more with BP. and we wouldnt have been cleaning up after that mess. You dont have to choose between building it and compromising safety. You do it right if were going to do it. Unfortunately. thats not what were doing. You deem it. and you give away those rights. Its personal for me. I grew up in the Nebraska Sandhills. It was the good people of Nebraska and the Republican Governor who told us to step back. to slow down. and to pick a different routeand finished it in January of this year. So when you hear about all of the process. process gets it right. I have to tell youand I do agree with my colleague on thisthat there are jobs to be created here. We send $1 billion a day for oil to countries that hate us. Theyll hate us for free. Keep it here. We dont have to do this. There have also been delays in this project. This bill is a bridge way too far. Be honest with the peoplethis is not by building it is going to lower gas prices. Its not the longterm solution to our energy needs. There is no guarantee well even get the oil in this country. But we can come together. build a piece of it. and expand our portfolio. We shouldnt be muddying it up with wedge issues. The last time we had this vote. I voted with it all these times. but one time the political arm of my friends sent a notice out to my hometown newspapers asking why TIM WALZ wants to raise your gas prices and isnt with America. They forgot and got it wrong. I voted with them. That press release today is already written. and theyre sending it back. Its not going to do anything except to hurt the American peoples faith in our democracy. Youre not going to get cheaper gas prices. Youre not going to have this thing built overnight. you risk danger. The American people arent stupid. Dont treat them that way.
1130029549,Madam Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Sergeant Chuck Luther joined the Army after the 9111 attacks. He served in Iraq until a mortar round hit near him. knocking him unconscious. What followed were classic symptoms of traumatic brain injuryblurred vision. chronic pain. and trouble concentrating. Liz Luras served this Nation honorably as a soldier in the United States Army. She survived a rape at the hands of her fellow servicemember. She did her best to continue her military service with the dream of attending West Point. She was raped two more times. with police reports and hospital visits to prove it. I know each of my colleagues here would expect that both of these warriors would receive the best care this Nation could provide. Sadly. the reality is far from that. Along with Liz and Chuck. since 2001. over 31.000 of our warriors have been discharged from the military. without benefits. because they were determined to have had a personality or an adjustment disorder. These are considered preexisting conditions. which means they should never have been allowed to enlist in the first place. Even though Sergeant Luther had multiple mental health evaluations and served honorably for a decade. it was only after the mortar attack that the military determined he had a preexisting condition. casually threw him away and denied him benefits and health care. A 2008 GAO study concluded that at least 40 percent of these personality discharges were handed down without going through the proper Department of Defense process. which means without the servicemembers being diagnosed by a licensed mental health professional. without the servicemembers receiving notification of his discharge and without the servicemembers receiving any formal counseling. Five years after this report. Congress has done nothing to ensure that these servicemembers records are reviewed or corrected. or to ensure that they receive the care that they earned serving this Nation. This week. the gentleman from California and I presented an amendment to this bill that would have allowed these warriors the basic appeal process to determine if they were improperly discharged. This amendment is the same as a bill I have. H.R. 975. This would only afford these warriors basic rights and due processesthe same ones that they put their lives on the line for that we have. That amendment was not allowed to come to this floor for debate or for a vote. Shame on us. A second amendment I offered would have simply put a moratorium on this process until we understood why it was being done and what was happening. That amendment was not allowed to come to this floor to be debated or voted on. Shame on us. Now. I want to be clear: the chairman and the ranking member of this committee had nothing to do with those decisions. and I am appreciative that they allowed the amendment that Im debating today to be brought here. Thats going to allow us to do another GAO study to determine if the problem is still there. Fine and good. but Ill tell you what: Chuck Luther doesnt want a studyhe wants justice. Liz Luras doesnt want a studyshe wants justice. The American people dont want another studythey want justice for their warriors. I would ask each of my colleagues to go home this weekend and ask your constituents if they think this is fair and if they want a study. or if theyd rather do whats right and take care of these warriors. Id also challenge my colleagues to ask the questions: Why wasnt the amendment made in order? Why couldnt we debate other than have a study? So I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. Its something. It will let us know what the scope of this selfinflicted injury and tragedy to our Nation is. Its not enough. Its not nearly enough. We should be ashamed that weve not shown Liz and Chuck the same respect and courage that they showed us as a Nation to serve in uniform. I. for one. am not going to rest until justice is served. our warriors are cared for and this wrong is made right. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130030315,Madam Chairman. I. too. want to thank the chairman and the ranking member. who not only have worked unwaveringly to craft a great piece of legislation. but collaborating. shepherding this thing through. saving taxpayer money. supporting jobs. streamlining for efficiency. and eliminating burdensome programs. Id also especially like to say theyve done it with dignity. theyve done it with grace. and theyve done it with the respect and thoughtfulness for this institution. And Ill tell you. the American people need a lot of that. Last week. we had a poll that showed us at a 10 percent approval rating. The North Koreans are at 17 percent. That ought to tell you something here. It would be funny if it wasnt so dang disappointing. The sacrifices that went into us doing the basic needs. the American public did not believe we could fulfill the basic needs. Well. you know what. theyre wrong on this count because were going to do it in here with the leadership of these two gentlemen who have spoken before. We need to make sure that this piece of legislation goes through the process. its amended by the Members of this House in an appropriate manner. and we move it forward. I can tell you. for those who say we would be better off just doing an extension. thats not what my dairy folks are telling me when theyve watched drought. flood. and winter kill. Theyre struggling day to day to try and feed their herds and facing liquidation. To them. no farm bill means no funding for livestock disaster programs. Tell that to my youth in my district. where the average age of a farmer is 58 years. where we lose all these good programs to put people on the land. So I urge all my colleagues: take a look at this. Do what youre hearing people say. This is reform. This is savings. This is smart policy. And it also gives the American people food security. Its a national security issue. We feed 316 million Americansour farmers doand billions worldwide. I ask my colleagues. look over our shoulder. in this quote by Daniel Webster. Let us try and develop something worth being remembered for. I urge passage of this bill.
1130037198,Mr. Speaker. I thank the ranking member. I come from a proud agricultural family. I proudly represent a strong agricultural district in the heartland in southern Minnesota. Im a proud ranking member on the subcommittee in the House Agriculture Committee. and Im proud to call both the ranking member and the chairman my friends. I am not proud of what you are seeing here today. The disrespect shown to this hallowed ground by hatching this abomination in the middle of the night and forcing it here because of extremist elements is the reason that the American people think higher of North Korea than they do of this body. I can tell you. as people listening today. Mr. Speaker. they are going to say it is more of the same. They said. he saidDemocrats or Republicans or whateverdont listen to me. Listen to this book full of people who said this is wrong: American Farm Bureau Federation. National Farmers Union. American Soybean Association. National Association of Wheat Growers. National Milk Producers. National Rural Electric Cooperative. Ducks Unlimited. Pheasants Forever. AgriBank. AgStar Financial Services. Izaak Walton League. National Catholic Rural Life Conference. Renewable Fuels Association. First Farm Credit Services. Advanced Biofuels. AgGeorgia. AgHeritage. AgriBank. Agriculture Council of Arkansas. Agriculture Energy Coalition. AgCarolina. AgCountry. AgFirst. AgStar Financial. AgTexas. Alabama Dairy Producers. Alabama Farmers Cooperative. American Agriculture Movement. American Association of Crop Insurers. American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians. American Bankers Association. American Coalition for Ethanol. American Crystal Sugar. American Farmland Trust. I may need more time. I am on the As. American Fruit and Vegetable Processors. American Forest Foundation. American Honey Producers. American Public Works Association. American Sugarbeet Growers. American Agriculture Coalition. Arizona Farm Bureau Federation. Arkansas Farm Bureau. Arkansas Farmers Union. Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges. It goes on and on and on. Listen to the public. listen to your constituents. reject the extremism. I am one of the 24 who put my money where my money is and voted for a bipartisan bill. This is wrong.
1130057792,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the full committee and the subcommittees for doing exceptional work. for putting our veterans first. for bringing a package of commonsense legislation to honor our Nations veterans. and doing it in the best and smartest manner we can. If the entire Congress functioned like the VA Committee. I think the American public would be far better served. There is a provision in this bill that is very simple. It recognizes the service and sacrifice of members of the National Guard and Reserves. These are the men and women of our Reserve component. They take the same oath of office. They do the same training. They and their family sacrifice their time and energy and stand at the ready at all times. They assist flood victims in Colorado and Minnesota. fight fires across the Western United States. and stand ready to fight and defend this Nation at a moments notice. They truly are the minutemen. I would guess that the vast majority of Americans and maybe even Members of this body dont recognize that you can serve 20 years doing that. and if you are not called to a specific title X service. you cannot be considered a veteran. You can go to the VA hospital. you can go use the GI Bill. you can be buried in a veterans cemetery. but you are technically a military retiree. This may seem like a small thing. but it is not. The title of ""veteran"" means more than just a license plate you get from your State. It is something your neighbors know about. These people dont and should not have to explain that they are technically not a veteran. This piece of legislationand I thank. again. the people who made this possiblesimply corrects that. Very seldom do we get a chance to do this. It doesnt add any cost. and it does the right thing. So it is not an added benefitwhich was earned. by the way. It simply corrects this. puts it in line. and honors. If you serve 20 or more years in uniform. you stand ready. you train people who went to war. we are going to give you the dignity and the honor of calling you a veteran. So I ask my colleagues to support this important package of legislation. This one small piece is the right thing to do. It is many. many years overdue. I ask for the support of H.R. 1405."
1130072292,Mr. Speaker. thank you to the chairman and the ranking member for your incredible hard work. The folks of Oklahoma and Minnesota should be proud of the representatives that they have sent here. I am proud of this piece of legislation. I stand in support of it. It has been 2 years. I feel like we have been at it most of our lives. And while I hear people pointing out problems. I am certainly there. If we had each written this bill. it would look different. I hear people say it is not perfect. We had a former colleague once who said. Of course it is not perfect. If you want perfect. you will get that in Heaven. And at times. this place is closer to Hell. So this is a pretty good compromise that we have come up with. It certainly does things. and I am proud to say it makes bold new investments in clean and renewable. Americanmade energy. This is a tough decision in a tough budgeting time. and of the commitment of this committee to make that happen. I could not be prouder. It also takes bold steps moving the country forward on conservation measures. One piece in here. protecting our native prairies in the Midwest. is fabulous. And I want to thank the gentlelady from South Dakota (Ms. Noem) for her unwavering effort on this. I would say this: we reject the false choice that you have to choose between sportsmens conservation and producing food on the land. You can have all things. And as the folks over at Ducks Unlimited said. this is one of the best pieces of conservation legislation in decades. We come out and do that. So we have struck a balance here. producing the food. feeding the world. clothing the world. and empowering the world. and at the same time providing for the heritage of our sportsmen and the pristine beauty of our country. So it can happen. As a veteran. I am proud that we took a bold step in here trying to figure ways to get returning veterans back on the land. The average age of a farmer in this country is 57 years old. We need new folks on the land. and that comes with high land prices and access to capital.
1130077089,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4076. a commonsense bill. I would also like to thank the chairman for always striking the proper balance between safety and the smooth operation of commerce. and the gentleman explained it very clearly. For many of us. especially in rural areas of the Midwest. propane is the fuel of choice for heating their homes. and to get an idea of what happened here. regular folks on a regular budget would spend about $600 to fill up their tank during the winter. They got a refill. got a bill. and saw that it was over $1.900 in some cases. The shock to them was one thing. but then the situation. as the gentleman so clearly stated. was exacerbated by the inability to deliver when we needed it. And propane. while there are many factors at work here. is not like other commodities in terms ofit is not a nicetohave thing. It is a necessity. So the chairmans bill. this bipartisan piece of legislation addresses one of the issues here. making sure we have the trucks on the road to deliver the propane. making sure the supply is enough to start making sure these things are filled until the end of winter. and doing so in a safe manner. I want to applaud the folks over at the FMCA that did do what they needed to do in issuing some of the waivers. but the gentleman is exactly right. A 30day waiver is not long enough. Winter is still deep in the Midwest. and we dont need to have the waiver expire on March 15. go through it again. and have the uncertainty. So this piece of legislation simply does as the gentleman stated. It allows an exemption without sacrificing safety to allow for the movement of propane into the markets where it is most needed. specifically the rural Midwest. These trucks are coming from Texas. It keeps the people on the roads. It keeps the trucks running. It keeps the propane tanks full. as those things start to happen and the market starts to stabilize a little bit. and the prices will come down. I do think the gentleman hit on a bigger point here. The infrastructure for the delivery of propane is something we need to look at. This is a shortterm emergency measure that will address the problem this winter. We need to look further down the road on some of the longterm solutions on this. So I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense piece of legislation. support it for all the right reasons. and then join together as we move forward to look at some longterm solutions. With that. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker.
1130122458,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I want to thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his remarks and for clearly stating this commonsense piece of legislation and for his support of it. I. too. would like to thank the gentleman from Oregon . He is the author of this piece of legislation. Something we have come to expect from Mr. SCHRADER is a commonsense. bipartisan piece of legislation. H.R. 5714. the Pest Management Records Modernization Act. is prosmall business and proconsumer. It improves the ability of pest management companies to communicate important information with their customers related to the products they use. As you heard from the gentleman from Pennsylvania. most States require pest management and other applicator companies to provide customers with information related to pest treatments. either automatically or upon request. Most of the requirements are implemented and enforced by State departments of agriculture. which are the State pesticide regulatory agency in 40 States. The required information is typically information directly from the pesticide label. The overwhelming majority of treatments performed by pest management professionals involve general use pesticides. Right now about 45 States permit electronic conveyance of this information directly to consumers. In fact. in the last 2 years. the States of California. Georgia. Wisconsin. Kansas. and Arizona have recognized the need to update their respective laws related to disclosure and passed legislation or taken administrative actions permitting electronic conveyance of pesticide application information. Like businesses in countless sectors of the economy. professional pest management and other pest applicator businesses are going paperless as a way to save costs and increase efficiencies. Going paperless allows businesses to back up and better safeguard data and records in case of a fire. flood. or other disasters. It also makes it easier to prove compliance with various recordkeeping. reporting. and related requirements. plus it has the added advantage of being greener and more environmentally sound. Unfortunately. the transition to a paperless office for many pest management and other pesticide applicator businesses is more difficult than anticipated because of antiquated State consumer information requirements from the 1970s and 80s that mandated transmission of such documents be via hard copies or paper and do not permit electronic conveyance. These requirements are especially disruptive for companies that have made the transition to paperless that operate in multiple States. some of which permit electronic conveyance and others that dont. It is important to note H.R. 5714 does not put any new mandates on small businesses but. rather. provides them the ability to electronically convey information in the handful of States that have not yet addressed this in a changing ecommerce environment. As I have said previously. and as my friend from Pennsylvania stated. H.R. 5714 is commonsense. it is bipartisan. it is proconsumer. and it is prosmall business. It deserves our support. and I encourage everyone to make its swift passage possible. With that. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
1130124859,Mr. Speaker. I want to extend my thanks to Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member MICHAUD. I think an American public which. many times. thinks all politics is is bickering and fighting and pettiness needs to see the two examples that these leaders show. consistently putting the needs of our veterans first and foremost. finding areas to improve. and holding people accountable. but this piece of legislation. most importantly. finding solutions to make life better for our veterans. And for that. I am forever grateful to them for the work and for the staff that worked on this. Ms. DUCKWORTH is not able to be with us today. I said a lot of times that people talk about patriotism and service and heroics. In TAMMY DUCKWORTHs case. you just state her name. and her life is a living testament to that. and she works every day. We are just happy she is with her little one now. but she had a big part in this. There are very few things that unite this country in the security of our Nation and in the care of our warriors. as I think many of us know. as do the millions who have fought the conflicts and who have fought extremism across the globepeople like Clay Hunt. a young marine. who went and did his duty. He was wounded in Iraq. That was not enough for Clay. so he went to Afghanistan. where he experienced some of the most horrific conditions you could imagine. That was not enough for Clay. He came home after he did his service in the Marine Corps. and he continued to serve. He went to Haiti. taking his skills that he had learned in the military to help after the hurricane. Then he came and sat in many of our offices and had many conversationseverything from the GI Bill to the transitioning back of our warriors who are dealing with PTS and making sure that we address their mental health issues. I know. for many of us. Clay was the epitome of American patriotism. of strength. of everything that is right. and it comes as such a shock. I know it sounds like a cliche. but how could someone so strong and who had done so much be dealing with these demons? We know he was. and we know this Nation didnt do enough. We know he didnt receive the adequate care that he deserved and had earned. To be quite honest with you. it is in our Nations best interest. both morally and securitywise and everything else. to give them that. Again. he didnt stop there. and his parents didnt stop there. His parentshis mother and fatherare here in this Chamber. as are his friends. to make sure this never happens to another family. Our friends at the veterans service organizations. like the IAVA and Paul Rykoff and his folks and the VFW. have asked us to do better. The result of this piece of legislation is the folks like Chairman MILLER. Ranking Member MICHAUD. TAMMY DUCKWORTH. Mr. BENISHEK. and others who have come down here to speak. Our differences are small compared to our commonalities. and our care for our warriors has to be there. You heard the specifics of this bill. some of the things that it will do. There is not one of us who is kidding oneself that this is going to be the silver bullet. but it puts it on the forefront. It brings some solutions that came from our warriors. that came from best practices. that came from both sides of the aisle. and brought it forward to find real solutions. The thing that most encourages me about this is that it is asking us. if things are not working. evaluate them and get rid of them. and bring the things forward that are going to work. Dont get buried in studies for 10 years. We dont have 10 years. We dont have 10 days for people. It is now. That is. I think. the beauty of this piece of legislation. It starts to move those things forward. It starts to bring the communities back into this. It starts to understand a holistic approach to dealing with the issues of veterans suicides. because this Nation cannot allow this to happen. We morally cannot. It attacks our soul when we do this. To be very honest. we cant afford to lose people like Clay Hunt. Clay Hunt is our leader. He is our future leader. He is our business leader. He would at some point have been in this Chamber or wherever he would have chosen to have gone. That was his destiny. and this is happening over 22 times every day. I encourage my colleagues to support this piece of legislation but. more importantly. to support the spirit that is behind itbringing us together to get it right: to care for our warriors with the best possible use for our resources and an accountability to those resources to make sure that the outcome is most important. That outcome is honoring our commitment to the reintegration of these warriors. Once they have done their service to this country. bring them home. make them whole. make sure that they are able to continue to serve this Nation as they wish. For that. I am grateful. I am especially grateful for the leadership of Clays family and of his mother. Susan. who absolutely said this can be done. this must be done. and it will be done. Thanks to these two gentlemens leadership. it will.

1130026904,Madam Chairwoman. I rise today to engage in a colloquy with the subcommittee chairman. Congressman CARTER. regarding Operation Stonegarden. which is a facet of our Homeland Security operations and which is provided for in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2014. By way of background. Operation Stonegarden is a Department of Homeland Security grant program that is intended to provide a great deal of cooperation and coordination among Federal. State. local. municipal and tribal law enforcement agencies in a joint mission to secure the United States borders. including travel corridors in States that border Canada and Mexico. as well as States and territories with international water borders. The grants are made available to local units of government. Theyre made based on risk analysis and feasibility of the proposed investments demonstrated by the applicants. I speak on behalf of local law enforcement entities in Arizona when I say that this program actually works. It serves to bolster resources available to law enforcement and border States as they do their best to tackle overwhelming problems of illegal immigration. in addition to illegal trafficking of drugs. persons. weapons and money. I hear nothing but praise for the program. and I know that the people of Arizona and other border States reap the benefits of this program whether they know the program by name or not. When people are involved in the process. you see certain programs and initiatives take off because everyones input is respected. considered and valued. In fact. the program works so well and is needed so badly that in 2009. Secretary Napolitano decided to extend an additional $30 million to be divided amongst the States which needed the resources most. Though I may not agree with Arizonas former Governor on many issues. this is a decision I applauded. The problem of illegal immigration is one that I think will remain for sometime. which is why we are debating immigration reform in Congress today. As I have said before. trust is a series of promises kept. Current and previous administrations held by both parties have failed to keep that promise. and so we are here today. Border security and interior enforcement are of utmost concern when considering immigration and the protection of our homeland. and this program is a prime example of the teamwork that is needed to deliver on the promises made to the people of this great Republic. This investment in our Nations homeland security is one that pays off over and over again. and it is my hope that future legislation will continue to provide robust resources for this program. It is our collective duty as a deliberative body to ensure that we both support the Federal programs and initiatives that actually work. while simultaneously reducing or sunsetting those that do not. I am pleased that the House has begun such a process in the past two Congresses. and I am proud to be part of it. The people of Arizona and I thank the chairman for increasing the resources available to Operation Stonegarden relative to previous appropriations. And with that. I yield to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
1130029838,Mr. Speaker. I want to thank my colleague for the time and her teamwork on this public lands initiative. But I am very frustrated that it even is necessary for us to reintroduce this legislation. It shouldnt take years and an act of Congress to right a wrong. Last year. the House overwhelmingly passed this bill by a vote count of 4211. Unfortunately. it was the victim of partisan gridlock in the United States Senate and was not sent to the President before the end of the 112th Congress. I see this initiative as unfinished business from the last Congress. and I hope. together. we can get this across the finish line very quickly this year. H.R. 862 is a commonsense solution to an incomprehensible Federal land situation in northern Arizona. In 1960. the Federal Government conducted a survey in which several acres of the United States Forest Service land were misidentified as private property. It was not until 2007. when the Federal Government contracted another private survey. that the mistakes were realized. and the residents of the Mountainaire neighborhood were informed of these errors. Until the 2007 survey. many of these residents have maintained these parcels and developed them as their own for years and. in some cases. decades. In essence. the Federal Government seized lands the residents had maintained. developed. and paid taxes on for years. Questions associated with the land ownership have plummeted property values in the neighborhood and prevented a number of owners from selling their homes. On some of those parcels. the revised boundary goes practically through portions of the residents homes or backyards. To fix the untenable situation. we reintroduced H.R. 862. The bill simply authorizes the Forest Service to convey all rights. titles. and interests to approximately 2.67 acres of the Coconino National Forest to the homeowners for a small fee. using an estimation process Congress utilized in another land exchange in the same northern Arizona county from the 109th Congress. Public Law No. 109110. The Forest Service does not want to own these peoples living rooms. and the property owners certainly do not want to share their homes or their yards with the Forest Service. This bill is a nobrainer. reported out of the Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation and relieve some northern Arizonans of this financially burdensome situation.
1130046225,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 1410. the Keep the Promise Act. introduced by a bipartisan group of Members from the Arizona delegation. would preserve Arizonas voterapproved gaming compact by prohibiting any Indian casino on land acquired in trust after April 9. 2013. in the Phoenix metropolitan area. This prohibition would expire on January 1. 2027. when the current gaming compact negotiated with the Arizona Governor expires. This bill helps to resolve public promises that were supposedly made in good faith to the voters of Arizona. In 2002. the voters supported the passage of Proposition 202. which limited the number of tribally owned casinos in the State. and it granted tribes exclusive rights to operate casinos in Arizona. During the Proposition 202 campaign. a public promise was made by a coalition of 17 Arizona tribes. including the Tohono Oodham Nation. to limit casino gaming in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Unfortunately. it appears that a tribe is on the verge of breaking that commitment. and more than a majority of the tribes in the State are upset. The immediate effect of the bill is to block the Tohono Oodham Nation from opening an offreservation casino in the Phoenix area. This is a modified version of a bill passed by an overwhelming majority of the House last year. As mentioned earlier. the bill has bipartisan support. including a majority of the House delegation. the Governor of Arizona. and six of the tribes that took part in the Proposition 202 agreement: the Salt River PimaMaricopa Indian Community. the Gila River Indian Community. the Hualapai Tribe. the Pueblo Zuni. the Cocopah Indian Tribe. and the Fort McDowell Yavapai Tribe. It is important to point out that it is not just Arizona tribes that support this bill. I have met tribes from other States. and they are very concerned about what is happening in Arizona. They believe that if our legislation is not signed into law. a dangerous precedent could be set. leading to the expansion of offreservation casinos in Arizona and other States. They want to see Congress protect State gaming compacts. For me. todays deliberations are not about stopping one casino or gaming as a whole. I support gaming. The Keep the Promise Act is about protecting the integrity of my States gaming compact. the future of gaming in Arizona. and. ultimately. the future of Indian gaming in this country. I urge adoption of the measure and reserve the balance of my time.
1130048825,"Thank you. Chairman HASTINGS. I appreciate the House spending time to consider this important jobs legislation this week. My home State of Arizona is known for its five Cs: cattle. citrus. climate. cotton. and. ultimately. copper. People have been digging in Arizona for precious metals like copper for centuries. In the 1850s. nearly one in every four people in Arizona were miners. Without a doubt. miners fueled the growth that makes Arizona the State it is today. Today. the Arizona mining industry is alive. but its not what it used to be. Nevertheless. a wide array of other minerals. such as copper. coal. uranium. lime. and potash. are mined throughout my district. These projects employ hundreds of my constituents with highpaying jobs. jobs that pay over $50.000 to $60.000 a year. plus benefits. In rural Arizona. those types of jobs are few and far between. Rural Arizonans recognize the major benefits this project will bring to our region and our State. which is why it was one of the first initiatives brought to my attention when I came to Congress. The Southwest Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act is a bill that protects important. environmentally sensitive lands in the State and opens up over 3.700 jobs at Resolution Copper Mine. My legislation is the result of years of negotiation and compromise that achieves a careful balance between conservation and resource utilizations. and Arizonans just want Congress to get it done. That is why my colleague on the other side of the aisle. Congresswoman ANN KIRKPATRICK. and I came together at the beginning of this Congress and jointly introduced this legislation. In fact. just last week. the largest paper in the State of Arizona. The Arizona Republic. issued an oped on House consideration of our bill. In the column. entitled. ""Stop Dawdling on Resolution Copper."" the editorial board stated: Congress needs to get this done. A copper mine proposed near Superior is a winner. It has bipartisan support from Arizonas congressional delegation. (How often does that happen?) It also has the potential to be an economic bonanza for our State and a national security boon to our country. The proposal has been around so long it has oldtimer status in Arizona. Congressional approval is overdue for the land swap necessary to make this happen. I guess that says it all. Our bill is a winwin for Arizona. That is why it has strong bipartisan support in Arizona and across the Nation. That support includes Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. fourfifths of the highly polarized Arizona Legislature. nearly every municipal government in central and southern Arizona. national business interests like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. the general contractors. the truckers and the manufacturers. and conservation organizations like the Sonoran Institute and the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. Why so much buzz about this project. you ask? Its called jobs. jobs. and jobs. Upon passage of the bill. Resolution Copper estimates it will be able to employ nearly 3.000 workers during a 6year construction period. and thats just the start. The mine. given the companys mine plan of operation when it complies with all environmental laws. will directly employ around 1.400 people. These are highpaying jobs ranging from $40.000 to $120.000 salaries per year in a region that is struggling economically. As many people familiar with mining communities know. an influx of over 1.000 mining jobs will spur additional economic growth in a community. These mine workers need restaurants to eat at. convenience stores to shop at. and homes to live in. A recent economic study estimates an additional 2.300 jobs could be created due to these demands. That brings the estimated total number of permanent jobs resulting from this legislation to about 3.700. Overall. independent analysis estimates that the total economic impact of the project will be around $61 billion. That is over $1 billion per year over the life of the mine. which equates to over $19 billion in Federal. State. county. and local tax revenue-$19 billion in tax revenue. In these tough fiscal times. I think we can all agree that local governments. and certainly the U.S. Treasury. could use those funds. This legislation also has national security implications. The U.S. currently imports 30 percent of its copper. and its demand is skyrocketing. This critical mineral is used in virtually all modernday technology. ranging from renewable energy and hybrid cars to your everyday electronics like cell phones and iPods. Our country must use domestic resources to meet this growing demand. and this project. as was said earlier. could yield enough cooper to yield 25 percent of our current demand. This legislation is not only a jobs bill. its a conservation bill. The lands the Federal Government acquires in the exchange are highly coveted recreational and conservation lands. It protects one of the few remaining undammed rivers in Arizona. the San Pedro River. The Dripping Springs property is a superb hiking and climbing location. The Cave Creek property will protect a riparian corridor. as well as numerous archaeological sites."
1130098048,Madam Chair. I rise today to offer one last amendment to save taxpayers money and hold a disorganized and wasteful department accountable for its actions and inactions. Following to the heels of my previous amendment. this amendment reduces funding for ineffective bureaucrats at HUD by $21 million. bringing their funding levels to the level recommend by the House Appropriations Committee in fiscal year 2014. The current bill funds these HUD bureaucrats through the administrative support offices at a staggering $500 million. My amendment reduces each subaccount by 4.2 percent. so that the sum of each reduction to each subaccount equals the $21 million reduction to the overall account. Again. this is the amount recommended by this committee for the overall account in fiscal year 2014. As I mentioned. I appreciate the work that the committee does to put these bills and committee reports together. but the committee report associated with the appropriations bill. once again. for the second year in a row. highlighted major deficiencies in the Housing and Urban Development management Offices. At minimum. this mismanaged agency should at least include those reprogramming efforts in their budget justifications. They failed to do so and are far from being considered a model of transparency. HUDs bureaucracy is not only massive. it is extremely wasteful and inefficient. The associated committee reportwhich I cited in my comments on my previous amendment a moment agois quite harsh to HUD and rightfully so. These same inefficiencies within the agency have been identified year after year after year. Again. Congress must not reward bad behavior with increased finding levels. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stated this amendment reduced budget authority in the bill by $21 million and reduces the 2015 outlays by $16 million. With an $18 trillion debt that continues to grow. it is irresponsible to throw more money at a department that cannot manage its own affairs. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their continued work on the committee. I yield back the balance of my time.
1130101577,"Madam Chair. I rise today to offer a costsaving amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for the fiscal year This is a straightforward amendment that will help bring defense spending priorities in line with the fiscal realities that the United States currently faces. Specifically. this amendment would prohibit the Department of Defense from wasting precious taxpayer dollars on the purchase of more expensive fuels made out of biofuels that are not cost competitive. When our country is more than $17 trillion in debt. and every year the Federal Government continues to spend nearly $1 trillion more than it actually has. it is incumbent upon this Congress to get this reckless spending under control and to carefully scrutinize every dollar that is spent. The Department of Defense has been purchasing biofuels to substitute traditional petroleumbased fuels to run its ships. aircraft. and other vehicles. The problem is that currently. these fuels are more expensive than traditional fuels. Until a time when biofuels are cost competitive without any Federal subsidy. no Federal entity should be utilizing this fuel source. Let me be clear: I support a true alloftheabove energy strategy which includes renewable energy sources like wind and solar. as well as traditional resources like natural gas and clean coal. I have nothing against biofuels that do not need significant Federal subsidies to exist in the open market. Unfortunately. the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies continue to waste precious taxpayer dollars to prop up this industry. Last year. the Defense Logistics Agency wanted to buy almost 15.000 gallons of biofuel. This year. the Defense Logistics Agency is seeking up to 37 million gallons of biofuel. Biofuels without Federal subsidies are nearly 15 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. The biggest problem with this years solicitation of nearly 37 million gallons is there is a $27.2 million Federal subsidy to make the biofuel blends ""cost competitive with their conventionallyderived counterparts."" The purchase of biofuels which are not cost competitive has been so wasteful that a popular news site recently listed the practice on its list of ""Five Insanely Wasteful Projects the Pentagon is Spending Your Money On."" I will read a brief excerpt from the article: In a nod toward sustainability. the U.S. Navy has been attempting to create a ""green fleet"" by adopting alternative biofuels. The catch is that the cleaner fuel costs $26 per gallon. which is much more expensive than the $2.50 the Navy pays for each gallon of petroleum. Despite reports that there isnt a clear longterm cost benefit of adopting biofuel. the Department of Defense has spent millions on private companies that are developing alternative fuels. And green projects arent confined to a single branch of the military. last year. the Air Force paid for 11.000 gallons of biofuel at a rate 10 times higher than the price of regular jet fuel. Using the military as a vehicle to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on unproven green experiments is clearly a wasteful use of taxpayer money that must be stopped. We all must understand that the number one priority of the United States militaryand. indeed. the Federal Government at largeis to defend the Nation from security threats. I would also like to bring up Admiral Mike Mullen. former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He stated in July of 2010 that: The biggest threat that we have to our national security is our debt. Therefore. it is essential that we scrutinize every dollar we appropriate to ensure we are spending our limited resources prudently and judiciously. This amendment will help accomplish this goal. Madam Chairman. this amendment was carried last year by our newly elected majority whip. STEVE SCALISE. and it was adopted by this body by unanimous consent. As the Defense Logistics Agency is now proposing to purchase almost 2.500 times more fuel than last year. it only makes sense this agreement is agreed to yet again. Think about it. Last year. they wanted 15.000 gallons. This year. they want 37 million gallons of Federally subsidized fuel sources. just to meet an unnecessary mandate. This defies common sense. and we should not be wasting millions of dollars of taxpayer money in this manner. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. and I reserve the balance of my time."
1130121178,"Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer a commonsense. oneword amendment to H.R. 4012. the Secret Science Reform Act. My simple amendment adds the word ""online"" to the disclosure requirements found in this legislation. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that my amendment would not score and would not affect direct spending or revenues. My amendment is supported by the chairman of the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. LAMAR SMITH. My amendment also has the support of the sponsor. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I would like to thank both the chairman. Mr. SMITH. and Congressman SCHWEIKERT for their efforts on this legislation and for their support of my amendment. As a result of my simple. good governance amendment. the EPA will be required to make all scientific and technical information relied upon for rulemaking available online before proposing or finalizing new regulations. I strongly support H.R. 4012. and I am proud to cosponsor this commonsense bill offered by my good friend and fellow Arizonan. DAVID SCHWEIKERT. The underlying bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency to utilize actual science when formulating regulations. and it requires that the science be made available for peer review and reproduction. A recent poll from the Institute for Energy Research found that approximately 90 percent of all Americans support making studies and data utilized by the Federal Government available to the general public. By the way. the general public is not stupid. The intent of the bill is transparency. and I believe the best way to accomplish that goal is to require this information to be posted online. For far too long. the EPA has used secret studies and socalled ""peer reviews"" from biased sources to justify regulations that fit their jobkilling agenda. Not only does this practice result in a lack of transparency. it also leads to hundreds of thousands of jobs being destroyed across the country by unreasonable and unnecessary regulations. A requirement similar to my amendment was adopted by this body when the House passed H.R. 4315 this past July. A provision found in H.R. 4315 required that data used by Federal agencies for Endangered Species Act listing decisions be made publicly available and accessible through the Internet. Finally. H.R. 4012 protects personal and confidential information and has a provision that makes clear such information will not be disclosed as a result of this act. My amendment would not conflict with such policy. Again. all my simple. oneword amendment does is require that the scientific and technical information requirements in the underlying bill be posted online. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my commonsense amendment. and I urge the passage of the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time."
1130121718,"H.R. 5752. Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant to the following: Article I. Section 8. Clause I (The Congress shall have the Power To . . . provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.). and Article I. Section 8. Clause 18 (To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers. and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States or in any Department or Officer thereof). Enacting this bill is consistent with the powers vested to the Congress of the United States. With regard to Clause 1. the enactment of this bill will buttress the cause of ""provid[ing] for the common Defence and general Welfare"" by incentivizing individuals with knowledge of the referenced crimes to come forth so that the perpetrators may be brought to justice. Further. the language in the bill serves as a deterrent to the enemies of the United States. for if they know others have monetary incentive to bring them to justice. they may be less inclined to continue their criminal activity. With regard to Clause 18. the bill provides the specific language. means. and authorizations to carry out the missions set forth in Clause 1. By Mr. LATTA: H.R. 5753. Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant to the following: Article I. Section 8. Clause 18 To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers. and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States. or in any Department or Officer thereof. By Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin: H.R. 5754. Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant to the following: Article I. Section 8 By Mr. STOCKMAN: H.R. 5755.

By Mr. STOCKMAN: H.R. 5756. Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant to the following: Amendment II of the Constitution of the A well regulated Militia. being necessary to the security of a free State. the right of the people to keep and bear Arms. shall not be infringed. By Mr. STOCKMAN: H.R. 5757. Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant to the following: Article 1. Section 8 of the Constitution of the United States: To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers. and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States. or in any Department or Officer thereof."
1130122112,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker. I would like to start by thanking the House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman. Doc HASTINGS. and his staff for all their efforts on H.R. 4924. As many of you are already aware. Chairman HASTINGS is leaving at the end of this Congress. Doc has served honorably since 1995. During my relatively short tenure in Congress. I have had the pleasure of working with Chairman HASTINGS on important matters. like protecting western water rights. improving our Nations forest health. and increasing our access to American energy resources. Since this could be the last time I work with Doc on a bill. I would like to thank him for his leadership and for everything he has done to make our country a better place. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to call Chairman HASTINGS a friend and a mentor. He is one of the classiest individuals I have had the pleasure of serving with. and he will most certainly be missed. Water in the West is critical to our future economic prosperity and. of course. is a limited resource on which there are many existing demands. H.R. 4924 is important legislation that will facilitate a fair and equitable settlement of certain claims within the Bill Williams Watershed in Arizona amongst the Hualapai Tribe. FreeportMcMoRan. a mining company. the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. and the Federal Government. My bill is good for property owners. good for local economies and jobs. settles an outstanding water rights dispute. and will result in a net water benefit to the basin. The first of the two agreements codified by this legislation allows for certain private water rights owned by Freeport to be severed and transferred to provide water certainty for one of the companys mining operations. The Baghdad mine has an economic impact of $339.1 million to the State of Arizona and sustains nearly 4.000 direct and indirect jobs. Under this first agreement. Freeport will also donate 3.400 acres of private land to Arizona Game and Fish Department to be managed as part of the MultiSpecies Conservation Program. Finally. this first agreement will benefit water users throughout the West as Freeport has agreed to cap its withdrawals of water in the Wikieup Wellfield at 10.055 acrefeet. despite being entitled to nearly 40.000 acrefeet of existing water rights. Thus. my bill will result in an overall net water use reduction in the basin of approximately 35.000 acrefeet per year. The second of the two agreements approved by H.R. 4924 will secure certain water rights for the Hualapai Tribe as well as two nonFederal contributions that will be provided by Freeport to the tribe for an infrastructure fund and economic development fund. In addition. there is a provision in H.R. 4924 that will allow for new public access for hunting and fishing on the lands involved with this legislation. Furthermore. the local counties benefit from the goodpaying jobs and tax revenue associated with the continued use of the mine. H.R. 4924 passed the full House Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent on November 19. Preliminary Congressional Budget Office estimates indicate that the bill costs nothing to the Federal Government and will not score. The entire bipartisan Arizona delegation and both Houses of Congress strongly support H.R. 4924 and signed on as original cosponsors of this legislation. Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this legislation that is extremely important to the State of Arizona. I urge immediate adoption by the House and hope my colleagues in the Senate will follow our lead and pass this critical bill in a timely manner this Congress.

1140033541,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to my good friend. Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN. and to congratulate him on the collegial and the transparent manner in which he has crafted this legislation. I also want to express my sincere appreciation for the efforts of Chairman HAL ROGERS. Ranking Member NITA LOWEY. and of all the members of the Defense Subcommittee. This bill. obviously. could not have been written without the dedication. long hours. discerning judgment. and thoughtful input of our committee staff and personal staffs. I thank them very much. The chairman has fully and fairly described the bill we are considering today. I believe he has accurately described the very dangerous and unpredictable world in which we live. As such. I will enter my detailed comments on the bill for the RECORD. Instead. I want to use my time during general debate to discuss the albatross around Congress neckthe Budget Control Act of 2011. Despite near universal disdain and plenty of buyers remorse from the 187 current House Members who voted in favor of the Budget Control Act. it has proven to be an extremely resilientyet utterly ineffectivepiece of law. We have seen short postponements of sequestration. We have seen 2year alleviations of the budget caps. Yet we find ourselves nearly 5 years since its enactment far from the consensus needed to repeal the law. Further. the continued halfhearted attempts to fix the Budget Control Act are almost as detrimental to the law. itself. as they add to the Nations uncertainty. Additionally. it is becoming increasingly difficult to point to any positive changes in our fiscal situation as a result. While intended to reduce the budget deficit through spending limits and reductions. our national debt has increased by 24.5 percent since the enactment of the legislation. mainly because the committees that are not truly constrained by discretionary spending caps continue to push politically popular legislation with little regard for its impact on the Federal budget. For example. in April of this year. Congress passed legislation that permanently fixed the longstanding issues with Medicares payment rates for physician services. According to the Congressional Budget Office. this fix will result in a $141 billion increase in Federal budget deficits over the next 10 years. yet the measure sailed through both Houses of Congress with very little opposition. and it was greeted by a cheerful signing statement at the White House. After 17 temporary measures. it is clear that a permanent doctor fix was long overdue. However. I believe it illustrates my larger point that we are nowhere close to having a sincere conversation about our deficits while nondiscretionary spending and a lack of revenue continue to. largely. get a free pass. Until the President and Congress stop whistling past the graveyard and confront the continued growth and mandatory spending. while simultaneously increasing revenues. our committeethe Appropriations Committeehas no choice but to carry out the implausible mandate contained in the Budget Control Act and try to control deficits with jurisdiction over only 34 percent of one half of the Federal Ledger. It does not help. I fear. that a majority of our colleagues have no idea when the fiscal year starts except that that is when you shut the government down. I despair that most think continuing resolutions are the norm and that sequestration is not all that bad. and that there is some delight every time a civilian Federal employee is furloughed. To me. all are symptoms of failure. The time we have caused people to waste by not finishing Congress work on time. enacting innumerable continuing resolutions. and vacillating from one top line to another is deplorable. Whether it is a Federal agency. a State. other political subdivisions. a nonprofit organization. contractors. or an allied nation all have been less efficient in recent years because of the constant uncertainty surrounding the Federal Governments finances. To illustrate. in nearly every fiscal year since the Budget Control Acts enactment. there have been attempts to alter the caps on defense and nondefense spending. Two years ago. the House and Senate had allocations that were $91 billion apart. yet the suballocation for defense was only about $4 billion as far as a difference. Both were in excess of the caps. Needless to say. we ended up at a point somewhere between the two. but only after we wasted an incredible amount of time. and shut down the Federal Government. While not a mirror image of 2 years ago. the fiscal year 2016 process is careening toward a similar fate. This fiscal year. the President got the process started by submitting a budget request that did not comply with the limitations mandated by the Budget Control Act across all budgeted fiscal years. The majority partys response to the President was to pass a budget resolution that purports to abide by the caps for fiscal year 2016 for defense and nondefense discretionary spending. yet evades the defense cap by proposing $38 billion above the Presidents budget request for overseas contingency operationsfor purposes of this act. the global war on terror. Despite the objections of the Secretary of Defense. this additional funding was further entrenched by the recently passed fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act. There is no question that Presidents Bush and Obama. the Department of Defense. and Congress have been complicit since 2001 in using emergency war funding to resource enduring requirements for the military. For the past few years. despite the constraints of the Budget Control Act. the Defense Subcommittee. led by my good friend Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN. has begun to make strides in limiting what is an eligible expense for OCO and shift activities to the base budget. and he is doing exactly the right thing. This was done because it is increasingly difficult. after 14 years. to argue that this operational tempo for our military is a contingency and not the new normal in defending our great Nation and our interests. Needless to say. I find the increased reliance on contingency funding very troublingand not because I object to providing additional funds for the Department of Defense. I agree with the Department. and I agree with the chairman that sticking to the caps for defense spending would necessitate our forces assuming unreasonable risk in carrying out our national defense strategy. But at the same time. Mr. Chairman. we need a strong nation as well as a strong defense. We cannot continue to let our country deteriorate. with interstate bridges that collapse and kill our citizens. meaningful scientific research that atrophies. and a population whose educational attainment falls further and further behind. Looking ahead. only the most Pollyannaish among us fails to see that we will be in the throes of another crisis in December. Our time. our staffs time. Congress time. the countrys time should not be wasted any longer. The President of the United States and the leaders of both parties of both Houses ought to start meaningful negotiations now so that they can conclude before October 1 to allow this great committee. the Committee on Appropriations. to again do the business of the country in an orderly. thoughtful. and timely fashion. I stress. this is not an issue of process. Congress should not be searching for ways to alter the process in order to avoid making hard decisions on an annual basis. This is a matter of will. and we need to use the power of the purse to its fullest. I expressed a number of concerns. but I would close. relative to the legislation before us. given the constraints that this committee faces. by observing that Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and the subcommittee have done an exceptional job in putting this bill together. In particular. the chairman has been meticulous with the $37.5 billion added to title IX of this bill. He has avoided the easy path. Rather. he has painstakingly worked to provide the needed resources for the preparation of our forces in the field. Further. the chair was very thoughtful in his construction of the base portion of the bill. and I believe it and the report provide the stability needed for our military personnelas the chairman emphasized. its readinessand it preserves our industrial base. I close by indicating I look forward to the debates on the amendments. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140034058,I would start my remarks by saying the gentleman from California has me at a disadvantage because we just received a copy of the final amendment that was offered in the House. Lines 7 and 8 are new to the amendment and refer to Executive Order No. 13963. which is in addition to other items that I am opposed to. I am told that those sections in that executive order refer to planning for sustainability. but I cannot confirm that to the Members of the House. I do rise in strong opposition to the gentlemans amendment. He talks about exotic itemsexotic items. The Department of Defense would be blocked from purchasing recycled paper. Lets not buy recycled paper at the Department of Defense. Now. there is a great idea. The Department would be blocked from generating renewable energy that might include using tents with photovoltaic materials that generate solar power onsite for our troops in Godforsaken places on this planet with no other access to energy sources. The Department would be blocked from considering sites for new Federal facilities that are pedestrian friendly and accessible to. God forbid. public transit. Perhaps we should move the Pentagon because it is near a Metro stop. The Department would be blocked from cooperating with the Department of Energys efforts to maximize the use of alternative fuels for our Federal fleet. The Department of Defense is the largest purchaser of energy in the United States of America. As a former member of the Congress. I have a profound respect for Senator Dick Lugar from Indiana. as he characterized energy. It is not an energy problem so much as it is a national security issue. given where and how much energy we import. The Department would also be blocked from advancing sustainable acquisition by trying to procure either less toxic or more waterefficient alternatives. My sense is that. in some portions of the State of California and other areas. they are desperate for a couple of extra drops of water. but that might just be too exotic. These are programs and initiatives that make sense. both for the environment and for fiscal responsibility. Moreover. the Department has been a leader in spurring new technologies. and I thought that is what drives the economy in America. This amendment is terribly illadvised. and I would strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose it. I yield back the balance of my time.
1140035056,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1314. which allows for fast track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for trade agreements entered into prior to July 1. 2021. including the prospective Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Past trade agreements have outsourced American jobs and caused irreparable harm to our domestic manufacturing base. I believe that TPP. TTIP. and other potential future agreements will be no different. Throughout my career. I have voted against unfair trade agreements. I voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). which was sold on the promise of creating 200.000 American jobs. After enactment. the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) estimates that America lost 682.900 jobs. primarily in the manufacturing sector. I voted against the Korea Free Trade Agreement. which was sold on the promise of creating 70.000 American jobs. After enactment. again the EPI estimates that America lost 60.000 jobs. The future trade agreements we are discussing today are being sold on the promise of creating more American jobs. That argument may continue to work for some. But I am not buying it. There has been a bipartisan failure. administration after administration. to address the effects of unfair trade on domestic manufacturers. Democrat and Republican administrations have been wrong to support irresponsible trade agreements in the past that have exacerbated the problems faced by American workers. President Obama is wrong in this instance. Congress should instead support trade agreements that substantially improve our existing trade laws and enhance our ability to enforce them in a timely fashion. We should only support trade agreements that include strong enforcement procedures. address currency manipulation. provide environmental protections. and protect American manufacturers from competing unfairly with exploited foreign workers. It is wrong to expect American workers to compete against stateowned enterprises that have unlimited government resources and violate our free market trade laws. American manufacturing and the steel industry are struggling every day to keep their footing in the fight against unfair trade. Earlier this year. I cochaired a Congressional Steel Caucus hearing where industry and labor representatives unanimously agreed that Americas steel sector is being systematically targeted by trading partners that use the U.S. market as their dumping ground. Just this month. six American steel producers. including two producers with facilities in my district. filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions against foreign countries engaged in illegal trade practices. While I am pleased that American steel producers are taking action to hold these countries accountable. I am concerned that this case will not stop the ongoing trend of countries dumping their products into U.S. markets. I have frequently testified in front of the International Trade Commission (ITC). and was pleased that in 2009 the ITC ruled against China in an Oil Country Tubular Goods case. However. last year I testified again in a similar case involving these same products. After duties were imposed on China in 2009. other countries. such as Vietnam. Thailand. Turkey. and South Korea. started dumping the same product on our shores. This is a dangerous trend and Congress and the Administration must stop such practices from continuing. I am encouraged that the House has taken some action to address unfair trade practices by including provisions in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 that would strengthen our antidumping and countervailing duty laws. But while these provisions are a step in the right direction. they are not enough. TPA does not include strong. enforceable currency reforms. and instead allows the Administration. without any clear guidelines. to determine how best to address currency manipulators. TPA does nothing to ensure that strong environmental protections will be included in future trade agreements. TPA does not crack down on worker exploitation or lay out a roadmap to ensure countries included in future trade agreements are in compliance with international labor and human rights standards. Such economic inhibitors should be rejected. Instead. we should focus on investing in and encouraging vigorous domestic manufacturing. Mr. Speaker. steel is the economic backbone of the First Congressional District of Indiana. the foundation of our manufacturing base. and an essential element of our national defense. I am proud to represent the workers who make this steel every single day. Today. I ask that my colleagues stand up for American workers and oppose H.R. 1314.
1140048486,Mr. Speaker. it is with profound admiration that I recognize the town of Kouts. Indiana. as it marks its 150th anniversary. In celebration of this special occasion. festivities were held in Kouts on August 22. 2015. which included a parade and commemoration ceremony coinciding with the towns annual Porkfest and the historic Aukiki Festival. An idyllic sanctuary for rural life. Kouts has become the thriving community it is today due to one noble trait: perseverance. In 1865. when surveyors of the nearby Pittsburgh. Cincinnati. and Saint Louis railroad sought lodging. they were denied at the first home they E1213 came to and wandered onward to be accepted with hospitality at the second. where the Kouts family lived. Henceforth. the family name was given to the area as it expanded from the Kouts train station and was built into a prospering community by the surveyors. The village applied for incorporation three times. failing twice before Kouts patience was rewarded in 1921. the same year electricity spread to the area. Kouts has always been a town of industry. not in the sense of material production. but in the sense that the people of Kouts have always toiled with conviction and tenacity to create the lives they envision for themselves and to lift up their community as a civil microcosm worthy of respect. It is a testament to the quality of the people of Kouts and their interest in supporting each member of the community that Blake Benson. an eighth grader at Kouts Middle School. has assumed the role of President of the towns Sesquicentennial Committee. performing the duties of his office with pride. In collaboration with his Committee. Blake has organized the joyous commemoration of this special day in Kouts history. For their devotion to their towns history and prosperity. I would like to acknowledge Mr. Benson. the Kouts Sesquicentennial Committee. and Kouts ClerkTreasurer Laurie Tribble. Mr. Speaker. I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the 150th anniversary of the town of Kouts. The towns long history of harmonious cohabitations is inspiring and is worthy of our admiration.
1140048997,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise to express my strong support for the Iran nuclear agreement. As the ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. I am acutely aware of the harmful influence Iran and its proxies have on the security situation in the greater Middle East. However. despite my clear and deep distrust of Iran. I firmly support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. given the improvement it works. This hardfought multilateral agreement will severely limit Irans nuclear ambitions. establish a verifiable and robust inspection regime. allow for the timely reinstatement of sanctions for violations of this agreement. and in no way limit U.S. military options. I cannot argue that the agreement is perfect. and I am frustrated at its limited scope. However. in any negotiation. especially one among sovereign nations. each having their own economic and security considerations. some compromise is necessary. Critically. I believe the agreement reached accomplishes the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I concur with the sentiments of my esteemed friend and former Senator Richard Lugar. who recently wrote that congressional rejection of the Iran deal would ""kill the last chance for Washington to reach a verifiable Iranian commitment not to build a nuclear weapon"" and ""destroy the effective coalition that brought Iran to the negotiating table."" I believe it is vital for the duration of the agreement that the U.S. leads the international community to maintain focus on Irans compliance and ensure that Iran does not undermine regional stability through other pathways. To accomplish this. we must remain steadfast in our commitments to Israel and all our regional partners. I ask all to constructively work to improve the security situation in the Middle East. rather than using all of their energy to undermine the agreement. We cannot rely on force of arms alone to bring lasting stability to any region of the world. In conclusion. I do hope that the exhaustive multilateral negotiation that led to this agreement will serve as a template for future U.S. and international engagement on other outstanding issues that have led to instability and violence in the region."
1140100114,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to begin by conveying my deep appreciation. as well. for Chairman FRELINGHUYSENS steady leadership of the Defense Subcommittee. His commitment to this subcommittees tradition of cooperation and bipartisanship is unwavering. and it is a pleasure to be able to work with him. I also would like to express my gratitude to Chairman ROGERS. Ranking Member LOWEY. and the other members of the subcommittee for their very good efforts. Additionally. as we all know. this bill could not have been written without the dedication. long hours. and discerning and thoughtful input of our committee staff and associate staffs. The chairman has well and clearly articulated the major elements of the bill and report. Under less than ideal circumstances and unsettled conditions. he and the subcommittee staff have. again. demonstrated their talent and acumen in putting together this legislation. There are many highlights to the bill. However. I will use my time during general debate to discuss the circumstances and conditions that led to the proposal to use nearly 27 percent of the overseas contingency operations. OCO. accounts to fund base Department of Defense programs. which gives me pause as an appropriator. It was as an appropriator that I opposed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and its arbitrary spending caps that only address onesixth of the Federal budget equation. In each session of Congress. we should be making discrete decisions on how we annually invest our discretionary dollars. Setting inflexible spending targets for 10 years is. in my opinion. nonsensical. I believe we need to invest in our roads. ports. drinking water infrastructure. universities. and our Nations defense. We need to generate more resources. and we need to have a fulsome discussion of our entitlement programs. My assumption is that there are very few people in Congress who believe that the Federal Government is currently making enough of a longterm investment in our Nation and its interests. It was as an appropriator that I voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. which mitigated the BCA caps on base discretionary funding and capped OCO spending for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. I. obviously. would have rather seen the complete repeal of the act. But. nevertheless. I supported it because it provided some clarity to the appropriations process for the balance of this Congress. As such. we were able to wrap up the fiscal year 2016 process. and with a top line number for fiscal year 2017. I was guardedly optimistic that the House would have predictability this year. The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee was far along in its 2017 process when the OCO to base strategyconceived to placate some on other committeeswas settled upon as the strategy for the House majority. While this bill technically does not violate the caps established by the BBA for base defense programs and OCO. it is hard to argue that this bill was assembled under what passes for normalcy in this Congress. And there is no doubt that the chairman and the subcommittee members and staff made smart investment decisions in executing the $15.7 billion in OCO to base funding strategy. However. I am troubled with the circumstances that compelled the subcommittees action. First and foremost. the fiscal year begins October 1. 2016. not May 1. 2017. and it is the responsibility of us holding office in the second session of the 114th Congress to execute the 2017 fiscal year appropriations process. In order to make OCO funding available for base programs. our bill only provides enough funding to fully support the warfighter until the end of April 2017. which is 5 months before the end of the fiscal year. This is intended to force the next administration and the next Congress to pass a supplemental in calendar year 2017 to support ongoing combat operations. It is not the responsibility of the 115th Congress to finish a predetermined fraction of our work. and we should not be dismissive of the difficulties created. To assume that there will be smooth sailing for a supplemental appropriations bill in the spring is very problematic. We do not know who will be in the White House. We do not know who will be the civilian leadership at the Department of Defense. And we do not know the composition in the next Congress. And as we have clearly seen from the Zika virus debate and. before that. Hurricane Sandy. supplemental appropriations bills are not without controversy. Additionally. in making the $15.7 billion in cuts to the OCO budget request. the committee has had to make some assumptions on the pace of combat operations between now and May 2017. While Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN exercised great care and caution. there is not much wiggle room in the interim. If the OCO spend rate were to increase for any reason in an uncertain world. Congress and a new administration would have to act quickly to pass a supplemental in early 2017. If that supplemental were not timely. the Department would likely be forced to reprogram or transfer base dollars to OCO. which shortchanges other priorities. negates the committees funding levels. and still requires a supplemental to backfill both base and OCO while not violating the BCA caps. Will said supplemental be funded by offsets from resources within the other 11 appropriations bills? Adding to the uncertainty. the House majority is going it alone with this strategy. To date. it has been rejected by the administration. the Senate Appropriations Committee. as well as the full Senate. While those institutions are not infallible. I fear that if the House majority insists upon heading down this path. we are looking at an impossible conference process. Putting concerns about uncertainty aside. I further believe that the OCO to base strategy abdicates our discretionCongress discretionto the Department of Defense in executing the remaining OCO funding. In order to free $15.7 billion. certain appropriations in OCO were subject to reductions. These reductions were done at the account level. not at the program level. For example. Navy O&M in the OCO title was reduced by $2.9 billion from its requested level. The Department has discretion on how to apply that $2.9 billion reduction across 10 programs under that account. I believe that should be our discretion. A final concern I haveand one expressed in prior yearsis that we should eliminate the reliance on OCO funding in the first instance and shift activities to the base budget. It is increasingly difficult after 15 years of war to argue that this operational tempo for our military is a contingency and not the new normal in defending our Nation and our interests. This subcommittee has correctly begun to limit what is an eligible expense in OCO. but under the act and this latest proposal. we could take a step back. For example. this bill proposes to increase end strength by 52.000 troops above planned reductions for the Army. Marine Corps. and Air Force. The chairman alluded to it in his opening remarks. I absolutely agree with him that we need new personnel. but this additional force structure costs $3 billion in 2017. What remains unsaid is if you look out for the next 5 years. it will also increase spending by $30 billion that is not budgeted for. In closing. I have taken some time describing my concerns with the circumstances that impact less than 3 percent of the total bill. But the manufactured uncertainty introduced by these circumstances diminishes the likelihood that this committee and the Congress will complete its work on time. It is a mark of the talent of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and our staff. their commitment to our troops and our Nations defense. and their seriousness of purpose. that they have done so much good to ameliorate the problems caused and highlighted in my remarks. I look forward to working with Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and the Members of this House as we advance the process over the next several days and complete the task before us. I also look forward to the debate on amendments. Mr. Chair. I would like to begin by conveying my deep appreciation for Chairman FRELINGHUYSENs steady leadership of the Defense Subcommittee. His commitment to this subcommittees tradition of cooperative bipartisanship is unwavering and it is a pleasure working with him. I also would like to express my gratitude to Chairman ROGERS. Ranking Member LOWEY. and the other Members of the Subcommittee for their efforts. Additionally. this bill could not have been written without the dedication. long hours. discerning and thoughtful input of our committee staff and personal staffs. I want to thank Rob Blair. Sherry Young. Walter Hearne. BG Wright. Brooke Boyer. Adrienne Ramsay. Allison Deters. Megan Milam. Colin Lee. Cornell Teague. Matthew Bower. Rebecca Leggieri. Chris Bigelow. Steve Wilson. Joe DeVooght. and Luke Wood. The Chairman has well and clearly articulated the major elements of the bill and report. Under less than ideal circumstances and unsettled conditions. he and the Subcommittee staff have again demonstrated their talent and acumen in putting together this legislation. There are many highlights to the bill. However. I will use my time during general debate to discuss the circumstances and conditions that led to the proposal to use nearly 27 percent of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) accounts to fund base Department of Defense programs. which gives me pause as an Appropriator. It was as an Appropriator that I opposed the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) and its arbitrary spending caps that only address onesixth of the federal budget equation. In each session of Congress we should be making discrete decisions on how we annually invest our discretionary dollars. Setting inflexible spending targets for 10 years is nonsensical. I believe we need to invest more in our roads. ports. drinking water infrastructure. universities. and our defense. We need to generate more resources. and the need to have a fulsome discussion of our entitlement programs. My assumption is that there are very few people in Congress who believe that the federal government is currently making enough of a longterm investment in our nation and its interests. And it was as an Appropriator. that I voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA). which mitigated the BCA caps on base discretionary funding and capped OCO spending for Fiscal Years (FY) 2016 and 2017. I obviously would have rather seen the complete repeal of the BCA. but nonetheless. I supported the BBA. because it provided some clarity to the Appropriations process for the balance of the 114th Congress. As such. we were able to wrap up the FY 2016 process and. with a number for FY 2017. I was guardedly optimistic that the House would have predictability this year. The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee was far along in its FY 2017 process. when the OCO to Base strategyconceived to placate some on other Committeeswas settled upon as the strategy for the House Majority. While this bill technically does not violate the caps established by the BBA for base defense programs and OCO. it is hard to argue that this bill was assembled under what passes for normalcy in this Congress.

To assume there will be smooth sailing for a supplemental appropriations bill in the spring is problematic. We do not know who will be in the White House. who will be the civilian leadership at DoD. nor the composition of the next Congress. And as we can clearly see from the Zika Virus debate. and before that Hurricane Sandy. supplemental appropriations bills are not without controversy. Additionally. in making the $15.7 billion in cuts to the OCO budget request. the Committee had to make some assumptions on the pace of combat operations between now and May 2017.

Navy O&M in the OCO Title was reduced by $2.9 billion. from its requested level of $6.8 billion. The Department has discretion on how it will apply that $2.9 billion reduction across the tens of programs under that account. A final concern I have. and one expressed in prior years. is that we should eliminate the reliance on OCO funding in the first instance and shift activities to the base budget. It is increasingly difficult after fifteen years of war to argue that this operational tempo for our military is a contingency and not the new normal in defending our nation and our interests. This Subcommittee had correctly begun to limit what is an eligible expense in OCO. but under the BBA and this latest proposal we would take a step back. For example. this bill proposes to increase end strength by 52.000 above planned reductions for the Army. Marine Corps. and Air Force. And I agree that we need more personnel. but this additional force structure costs $3 billion in FY 2017 and is paid for with OCO to Base dollars. But. we defer the tough decisions. This is particularly true when recognizing the fact that BCA caps are scheduled to lower defense spending by $2 billion in FY 2018. An increase in end strength creates a tail of spending in future years. The DoD estimates that the troop levels funded in the bill will increase spending by $30 billion over five years. That is $30 billion that is not budgeted for. but $30 billion that our Committee will be expected to pay for. In closing. I have taken some time describing my concerns with the circumstances that impact less than three percent of the total bill. But the manufactured uncertainty introduced by these circumstances diminishes the likelihood that this Committee and the Congress will complete its work. It is a mark of the talent of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and our staff. their commitment to our troops and our nations defense. and their seriousness of purpose. that they have done so much good to ameliorate the problems caused by this approach. I look forward to working with Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and the members of the House to advance the process and complete the task before us. I look forward to the debate on amendments. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140100773,Mr. Chair. there is no question. I think. from anyone in this Chamber that the Members of the United States military and the Department of Defense are the finest human beings on planet Earth. Their primary charge is to keep our country safe and secure. But I also think that we take great pride when they go above and beyond that particular charge that we have given them under the Constitution. And when there is a disaster in the country of Haiti. who do people call on for help but members of the Department of Defense and the United States military. When there is flooding in Bangladesh. who is called upon? Members of the United States Armed Forces to help in a humanitarian crisis. When you have problems and earthquakes in Japan. who do they reach out to? Members of the United States military for humanitarian assistance. We have concerns in Pakistan and tragedies. who reaches out to members in the Armed Forces of the United States for humanitarian assistance but the Government of Pakistan. You have a typhoon in the Philippines. and who is called into action. not militarily. but from a humanitarian and relief standpoint? Members of the United States military repeatedly because we are a humane Nation. What we are talking about with this gentlemans amendment that I strongly oppose is temporarily housing unaccompanied minor children who find themselves in a tragic circumstance in the United States of America. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement is required by law to provide shelter. care. and placement. Because the number of unaccompanied children has spiked in recent years. it is difficult for HHS to find temporary housing for all of them. As long as there is no impact on DOD military activities. the Department should be allowed to identify facilities in the United States to provide the same type of humanitarian assistance to minor children that we do in the Philippines. Pakistan. Japan. Bangladesh. and Haiti. I live in a humane country that reaches out to help people who cant help themselves. and I think we should allow the United States military to do that in the United States of America when it does not impact their military operations. I reserve the balance of my time.
1140101674,Mr. Chairman. I dont necessarily oppose the gentlemans amendment. but I would want to make some remarks regarding it. The European Command believes this amendment would make it more difficult and costly to acquire energy for European military installations. and I would note in next years authorization there is language included to study the logistics and support capability gaps for our military forces in Eastern Europe. I believe results of that analysis will inform this amendment and many others related to the European Command and the efforts of the European Reassurance Initiative. I believe Congress should wait until the Comptroller General and the Defense Department have had time to analyze European military installation energy source issues and offer them the opportunity to propose a range of recommendations to the Congress. I also do believe that if the amendments language is broadly written. it includes all contracts. and the restriction would impact the Defense Logistics Agency Energy. That energy agency would have to include a clause in their contracts to prohibit manufacturers from procuring fuel from the Russian Federation as Russia is not a prohibited source. This requirement may have Trade Agreements Act implications. Additionally. this language would be problematic as the Defense Logistics Agency Energy does not have the visibility over the source of crude oil for their suppliers. The agency does not have sourcing information under their contracts for refined products based on trade agreements. contract requirements. Currently. we do not have contracts where suppliers have certified that a refined product is sourced from Russia. A final concern is that if the amendment covers Russianaffiliated companies that provide nonRussian refined fuel. again. the Agency does not obtain detailed information regarding subcontractors. So there are a number of questions. The gentleman does raise a very important issue relative to energy use. particularly on the European Continent. I just wanted to make my colleagues known of those concerns. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.
